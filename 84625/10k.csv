B USINESS GENERAL Embracing Our Future Microsoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. We strive to create local opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world. We are creating the platforms and tools , powered by artificial intelligence (“ AI ”), that deliver better, faster, and more effective solutions to support small and large business competitiveness, improve educational and health outcomes, grow public-sector efficiency, and empower human ingenuity. From infrastructure and data, to business applications and collaboration, we provide unique, differentiated value to customers. In a world of increasing economic complexity, AI has the power to revolutionize many types of work. Microsoft is now innovating and expanding our portfolio with AI capabilities to help people and organizations overcome today’s challenges and emerge stronger. Customers are looking to unlock value from their digital spend and innovate for this next generation of AI, while simplifying security and management. Those leveraging the Microsoft Cloud are best positioned to take advantage of technological advancements and drive innovation. Our investment in AI spans the entire company, from Microsoft Teams and Outlook, to Bing and Xbox, and we are infusing generative AI capability into our consumer and commercial offerings to deliver copilot capability for all services across the Microsoft Cloud. We’re committed to making the promise of AI real – and doing it responsibly. Our work is guided by a core set of principles: fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability. What We Offer Founded in 1975, we develop and support software, services, devices, and solutions that deliver new value for customers and help people and businesses realize their full potential. We offer an array of services, including cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content, and we provide solution support and consulting services. We also deliver relevant online advertising to a global audience. Our products include operating systems, cross-device productivity and collaboration applications, server applications, business solution applications, desktop and server management tools, software development tools, and video games. We also design and sell devices, including PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories. The Ambitions That Drive Us To achieve our vision, our research and development efforts focus on three interconnected ambitions: Reinvent Productivity and Business Processes At Microsoft, we provide technology and resources to help our customers create a secure, productive work environment. Our family of products plays a key role in the ways the world works, learns, and connects. 4 PART I Item 1 Our growth depends on securely delivering continuous innovation and advancing our leading productivity and collaboration tools and services, including Office 365, Dynamics 365, and LinkedIn. Microsoft 365 brings together Office 365, Windows, and Enterprise Mobility + Security to help organizations empower their employees with AI-backed tools that unlock creativity, increase collaboration, and fuel innovation, all the while enabling compliance coverage and data protection. Microsoft Teams is a comprehensive platform for work, with meetings, calls, chat, collaboration, and business process automation. Microsoft Viva is an employee experience platform that brings together communications, knowledge, learning, resources, and insights. Microsoft 365 Copilot combines next-generation AI with business data in the Microsoft Graph and Microsoft 365 applications. Together with the Microsoft Cloud, Dynamics 365, Microsoft Teams, and our AI offerings bring a new era of collaborative applications that optimize business functions, processes, and applications to better serve customers and employees while creating more business value. Microsoft Power Platform is helping domain experts drive productivity gains with low-code/no-code tools, robotic process automation, virtual agents, and business intelligence. In a dynamic labor market, LinkedIn is helping professionals use the platform to connect, learn, grow, and get hired. Build the Intelligent Cloud and Intelligent Edge Platform As digital transformation and adoption of AI accelerates and revolutionizes more business workstreams, organizations in every sector across the globe can address challenges that will have a fundamental impact on their success. For enterprises, digital technology empowers employees, optimizes operations, engages customers, and in some cases, changes the very core of products and services. We continue to invest in high performance and sustainable computing to meet the growing demand for fast access to Microsoft services provided by our network of cloud computing infrastructure and datacenters. Our cloud business benefits from three economies of scale: datacenters that deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones; datacenters that coordinate and aggregate diverse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns, improving the utilization of computing, storage, and network resources; and multi-tenancy locations that lower application maintenance labor costs. The Microsoft Cloud provides the best integration across the technology stack while offering openness, improving time to value, reducing costs, and increasing agility. Being a global-scale cloud, Azure uniquely offers hybrid consistency, developer productivity, AI capabilities, and trusted security and compliance. We see more emerging use cases and needs for compute and security at the edge and are accelerating our innovation across the spectrum of intelligent edge devices, from Internet of Things (“IoT”) sensors to gateway devices and edge hardware to build, manage, and secure edge workloads. Our AI platform, Azure AI, is helping organizations transform, bringing intelligence and insights to the hands of their employees and customers to solve their most pressing challenges. Organizations large and small are deploying Azure AI solutions to achieve more at scale, more easily, with the proper enterprise-level and responsible AI protections. We have a long-term partnership with OpenAI, a leading AI research and deployment company. We deploy OpenAI’s models across our consumer and enterprise products. As OpenAI’s exclusive cloud provider, Azure powers all of OpenAI's workloads. We have also increased our investments in the development and deployment of specialized supercomputing systems to accelerate OpenAI’s research. Our hybrid infrastructure offers integrated, end-to-end security, compliance, identity, and management capabilities to support the real-world needs and evolving regulatory requirements of commercial customers and enterprises. Our industry clouds bring together capabilities across the entire Microsoft Cloud, along with industry-specific customizations. Azure Arc simplifies governance and management by delivering a consistent multi-cloud and on-premises management platform. Nuance, a leader in conversational AI and ambient intelligence across industries including healthcare, financial services, retail, and telecommunications, joined Microsoft in 2022. Microsoft and Nuance enable organizations to accelerate their business goals with security-focused, cloud-based solutions infused with AI. We are accelerating our development of mixed reality solutions with new Azure services and devices. Microsoft Mesh enables organizations to create custom, immersive experiences for the workplace to help bring remote and hybrid workers and teams together. 5 PART I Item 1 The ability to convert data into AI drives our competitive advantage. The Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform is a leading cloud data platform that fully integrates databases, analytics, and governance. The platform empowers organizations to invest more time creating value rather than integrating and managing their data. Microsoft Fabric is an end-to-end, unified analytics platform that brings together all the data and analytics tools that organizations need. GitHub Copilot is at the forefront of AI-powered software development, giving developers a new tool to write code easier and faster so they can focus on more creative problem-solving. From GitHub to Visual Studio, we provide a developer tool chain for everyone, no matter the technical experience, across all platforms, whether Azure, Windows, or any other cloud or client platform. Windows also plays a critical role in fueling our cloud business with Windows 365, a desktop operating system that’s also a cloud service. From another internet-connected device, including Android or macOS devices, users can run Windows 365, just like a virtual machine. Additionally, we are extending our infrastructure beyond the planet, bringing cloud computing to space. Azure Orbital is a fully managed ground station as a service for fast downlinking of data. Create More Personal Computing We strive to make computing more personal, enabling users to interact with technology in more intuitive, engaging, and dynamic ways. Windows 11 offers innovations focused on enhancing productivity, including Windows Copilot with centralized AI assistance and Dev Home to help developers become more productive. Windows 11 security and privacy features include operating system security, application security, and user and identity security. Through our Search, News, Mapping, and Browser services, Microsoft delivers unique trust, privacy, and safety features. In February 2023, we launched an all new, AI-powered Microsoft Edge browser and Bing search engine with Bing Chat to deliver better search, more complete answers, and the ability to generate content. Microsoft Edge is our fast and secure browser that helps protect users’ data. Quick access to AI-powered tools, apps, and more within Microsoft Edge’s sidebar enhance browsing capabilities. We are committed to designing and marketing first-party devices to help drive innovation, create new device categories, and stimulate demand in the Windows ecosystem. The Surface family includes Surface Pro, Surface Laptop, and other Surface products. Microsoft continues to invest in gaming content, community, and cloud services. We have broadened our approach to how we think about gaming end-to-end, from the way games are created and distributed to how they are played, including subscription services like Xbox Game Pass and new devices from third-party manufacturers so players can engage across PC, console, and mobile. In January 2022, we announced plans to acquire Activision Blizzard, Inc., a leader in game development and an interactive entertainment content publisher. Our Future Opportunity We are focused on helping customers use the breadth and depth of the Microsoft Cloud to get the most value out of their digital spend while leading the new AI wave across our solution areas. We continue to develop complete, intelligent solutions for our customers that empower people to be productive and collaborate, while safeguarding businesses and simplifying IT management. Our goal is to lead the industry in several distinct areas of technology over the long term, which we expect will translate to sustained growth. We are investing significant resources in: 6 PART I Item 1 Our future growth depends on our ability to transcend current product category definitions, business models, and sales motions. Corporate Social Responsibility Commitment to Sustainability Microsoft’s approach to addressing climate change starts with the sustainability of our own business. In 2020, we committed to being a carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste company by 2030. In May 2023, we released our Environmental Sustainability Report which looked back at our progress during fiscal year 2022. We continued to make progress on our goals, with our overall emissions declining by 0.5 percent. While our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions continued to decline, Scope 3 emissions increased by 0.5 percent. Scope 3 represented 96 percent of our total emissions, resulting primarily from the operations of our suppliers and the use of our products across our customers. A few examples of our continued progress include: Microsoft has a role to play in developing and advancing new climate solutions, but we recognize that no solution can be offered by any single company, organization, or government. Our approach helps to support the sustainability needs of our customers and the global community. Our Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability, an environmental sustainability management platform that includes Microsoft Sustainability Manager, enables organizations to record, report, and reduce their Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. These digital tools can interoperate with business systems and unify data intelligence for organizations. Addressing Racial Injustice and Inequity We are committed to addressing racial injustice and inequity in the United States for Black and African American communities and helping improve lived experiences at Microsoft, in employees’ communities, and beyond. Our Racial Equity Initiative focuses on three multi-year pillars, each containing actions and progress we expect to make or exceed by 2025. 7 PART I Item 1 In fiscal year 2023, we collaborated with partners and worked within neighborhoods and communities to launch and scale a number of projects and programs, including: We exceeded our 2020 goal to double the percentage of our transaction volumes with Black- and African American-owned financial institutions by 2023. We are also increasing investment activity with Black- and African American-owned asset managers, which now represent 45 percent of our external manager group, enabling increased funds into local communities. We also met our goal of creating a $100 million program focused on mission-driven banks. We enriched our supplier pipeline, achieving our goal to spend $500 million with double the number of Black- and African American-owned suppliers. We also increased the number of identified partners in the Black Partner Growth Initiative by more than 250 percent, surpassing our initial goal. We have made meaningful progress on representation and inclusion at Microsoft. As of June 2023, we are 93 percent of the way to our 2025 commitment to double the number of Black and African American people managers in the U.S. (below director level), and 107 percent of the way for Black and African American directors (people managers and individual contributors). We are 28 percent of the way for Hispanic and Latinx people managers (below director level) and 74 percent of the way for Hispanic and Latinx directors. Investing in Digital Skills After helping over 80 million jobseekers around the world access digital skilling resources, we introduced a new Skills for Jobs initiative to support a more skills-based labor market, with greater flexibility and accessible learning paths to develop the right skills needed for the most in-demand jobs. Our Skills for Jobs initiative brings together learning resources, certification opportunities, and job-seeker tools from LinkedIn, GitHub, and Microsoft Learn, and is built on data insights drawn from LinkedIn’s Economic Graph. We also launched a national campaign to help skill and recruit 250,000 people into the cybersecurity workforce by 2025, representing half of the country’s workforce shortage. To that end, we are making curriculum available free of charge to all of the nation’s higher education institutions, providing training for new and existing faculty, and providing scholarships and supplemental resources to 25,000 students. We have expanded the cyber skills initiative to 27 additional countries that show elevated cyberthreat risks coupled with significant gaps in their cybersecurity workforces, partnering with nonprofits and other educational institutions to train the next generation of cybersecurity workers. Generative AI is creating unparalleled opportunities to empower workers globally, but only if everyone has the skills to use it. To address this, in June 2023 we launched a new AI Skills Initiative to help everyone learn how to harness the power of AI. This includes a new LinkedIn learning pathway offering new coursework on learning the foundations of generative AI. We also launched a new global grant challenge to uncover new ways of training workers on generative AI and are providing greater access to digital learning events and resources for everyone to improve their AI fluency. HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview Microsoft aims to recruit, develop, and retain world-changing talent from a diversity of backgrounds. To foster their and our success, we seek to create an environment where people can thrive and do their best work. We strive to maximize the potential of our human capital resources by creating a respectful, rewarding, and inclusive work environment that enables our global employees to create products and services that further our mission. 8 PART I Item 1 As of June 30, 2023, we employed approximately 221,000 people on a full-time basis, 120,000 in the U.S. and 101,000 internationally. Of the total employed people, 89,000 were in operations, including manufacturing, distribution, product support, and consulting services; 72,000 were in product research and development; 45,000 were in sales and marketing; and 15,000 were in general and administration. Certain employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Our Culture Microsoft’s culture is grounded in growth mindset. This means everyone is on a continuous journey to learn and grow, operating as one company instead of multiple siloed businesses. Our employee listening systems enable us to gather feedback directly from our workforce to inform our programs and employee needs globally. Employees participate in our Employee Signals surveys, which cover a variety of topics such as thriving, inclusion, team culture, wellbeing, and learning and development. We also collect Daily Signals employee survey responses, giving us real-time insights into ways we can support our employees. In addition to Employee Signals and Daily Signals surveys, we gain insights through onboarding, exit surveys, internal Viva Engage channels, employee Q&A sessions, and our internal AskHR Service support. Diversity and inclusion are core to our business model, and we hold ourselves accountable for driving global systemic change in our workforce and creating an inclusive work environment. We support multiple highly active Employee Resource Groups for women, families, racial and ethnic minorities, military, people with disabilities, and employees who identify as LGBTQIA+, where employees can go for support, networking, and community-building. As described in our 2022 Proxy Statement, annual performance and compensation reviews of our senior leadership team include an evaluation of their contributions to employee culture and diversity. To ensure accountability over time, we publicly disclose our progress on a multitude of workforce metrics including: Total Rewards and Pay Equity We develop dynamic, sustainable, market-driven, and strategic programs with the goal of providing a highly differentiated portfolio to attract, reward, and retain top talent and enable our employees to thrive. These programs reinforce our culture and values such as collaboration and growth mindset. Managers evaluate and recommend rewards based on, for example, how well we leverage the work of others and contribute to the success of our colleagues. We monitor pay equity and career progress across multiple dimensions. Our total compensation opportunity is highly differentiated and is market competitive. In order to manage our costs in a dynamic, competitive environment, in fiscal year 2023 we announced that base salaries of salaried employees would remain at fiscal year 2022 levels. Pay increases continue to be available for rewards-eligible hourly and equivalent employees. We will continue our practice of investing in stock for all rewards-eligible employees, salaried and hourly, and investing in bonuses for all eligible employees. 9 PART I Item 1 Since 2016, we have reported on pay equity as part of our annual Diversity and Inclusion report. In 2022, we reported that all racial and ethnic minority employees in the U.S. combined earn $1.008 for every $1.000 earned by their white counterparts, that women in the U.S. earn $1.007 for every $1.000 earned by their counterparts who are men, and that women outside the U.S. earn $1.002 for every $1.000 earned by their counterparts outside the U.S. who are men. In this year’s report, we again expanded our pay equity data beyond the U.S. to report on 61 additional countries (up from 12 last year), representing 99.8% of our global Microsoft workforce. In addition, we began reporting on unadjusted median pay in our annual report, comparing total pay amounts for all employees regardless of factors such as job title, level, or tenure. For employees who are eligible for rewards, the analysis showed that total pay for women is 89.6% of total pay for men in the U.S. and 86.2% outside of the U.S., and total pay for racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S. is 89.9% of total pay for white employees. As we continue to increase representation for women and racial and ethnic minorities at more senior levels, and continue to ensure pay equity for all, the gap between the medians will reduce. Our intended result is a global performance and development approach that fosters our culture, and competitive compensation that ensures equitable pay by role while supporting pay for performance. Wellbeing and Hybrid Work Microsoft is committed to supporting our employees’ wellbeing while they are at work and in their personal lives. We have invested significantly in wellbeing, and offer a differentiated benefits package which includes many physical, emotional, and financial wellness programs including counseling through the Microsoft CARES Employee Assistance Program, mental wellbeing support, flexible fitness benefits, disability accommodations, savings and investment tools, adoption assistance, and back-up care for children and elders. Finally, our Occupational Health and Safety program helps ensure employees can stay safe while they are working. We introduced Hybrid Workplace Flexibility Guidance to better support leaders, managers, and employees in hybrid work scenarios. Our ongoing survey data shows that 93% of employees value the flexibility related to work location, work site, and work hours, and 78% are satisfied with the quality of connection with co-workers. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to flexible work at Microsoft. As a company, we will continue to leverage data and research to inform decision making, balancing the needs of business, team, and individual. Learning and Development We offer a range of learning opportunities, including personalized opportunities on our internal and external learning portals, in-classroom learning, required learning on compliance and company culture, on-the-job advancement opportunities, and manager coaching. We also provide customized manager learning, new employee orientation, and tools for operating in a flexible hybrid work environment. All Microsoft employees globally access our single Viva Learning tool for both required and personal choice learning. This includes courses focused on our core principles and compliance matters, such as Business Conduct, Privacy, Security Foundations, and Harassment Prevention. We also deliver skills training for employees based on their profession and role discipline. We have over 27,000 people managers, all of whom must complete between 20-33 hours of compulsory training on leadership and management and are assigned additional targeted training on an ongoing basis related to people management, compliance, and culture. 10 PART I Item 1 OPERATING SEGMENTS We operate our business and report our financial performance using three segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing. Our segments provide management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. The segments enable the alignment of strategies and objectives across the development, sales, marketing, and services organizations, and they provide a framework for timely and rational allocation of resources within businesses. Additional information on our operating segments and geographic and product information is contained in Note 19 – Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). Our reportable segments are described below. Productivity and Business Processes Our Productivity and Business Processes segment consists of products and services in our portfolio of productivity, communication, and information services, spanning a variety of devices and platforms. This segment primarily comprises: Office Commercial Office Commercial is designed to increase personal, team, and organizational productivity through a range of products and services. Growth depends on our ability to reach new users in new markets such as frontline workers, small and medium businesses, and growth markets, as well as add value to our core product and service offerings to span productivity categories such as communication, collaboration, analytics, security, and compliance. Office Commercial revenue is mainly affected by a combination of continued installed base growth and average revenue per user expansion, as well as the continued shift from Office licensed on-premises to Office 365. Office Consumer Office Consumer is designed to increase personal productivity and creativity through a range of products and services. Growth depends on our ability to reach new users, add value to our core product set, and continue to expand our product and service offerings into new markets. Office Consumer revenue is mainly affected by the percentage of customers that buy Office with their new devices and the continued shift from Office licensed on-premises to Microsoft 365 Consumer subscriptions. Office Consumer Services revenue is mainly affected by the demand for communication and storage through Skype, Outlook.com, and OneDrive, which is largely driven by subscriptions, advertising, and the sale of minutes. 11 PART I Item 1 LinkedIn LinkedIn connects the world’s professionals to make them more productive and successful and transforms the way companies hire, market, sell, and learn. Our vision is to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce through the ongoing development of the world’s first Economic Graph, a digital representation of the global economy. In addition to LinkedIn’s free services, LinkedIn offers monetized solutions: Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, Premium Subscriptions, and Sales Solutions. Talent Solutions provide insights for workforce planning and tools to hire, nurture, and develop talent. Talent Solutions also includes Learning Solutions, which help businesses close critical skills gaps in times where companies are having to do more with existing talent. Marketing Solutions help companies reach, engage, and convert their audiences at scale. Premium Subscriptions enable professionals to manage their professional identity, grow their network, find jobs, and connect with talent through additional services like premium search. Sales Solutions help companies strengthen customer relationships, empower teams with digital selling tools, and acquire new opportunities. LinkedIn has over 950 million members and has offices around the globe. Growth will depend on our ability to increase the number of LinkedIn members and our ability to continue offering services that provide value for our members and increase their engagement. LinkedIn revenue is mainly affected by demand from enterprises and professional organizations for subscriptions to Talent Solutions, Sales Solutions, and Premium Subscriptions offerings, as well as member engagement and the quality of the sponsored content delivered to those members to drive Marketing Solutions. Dynamics Dynamics provides cloud-based and on-premises business solutions for financial management, enterprise resource planning (“ERP”), customer relationship management (“CRM”), supply chain management, and other application development platforms for small and medium businesses, large organizations, and divisions of global enterprises. Dynamics revenue is driven by the number of users licensed and applications consumed, expansion of average revenue per user, and the continued shift to Dynamics 365, a unified set of cloud-based intelligent business applications, including Power Apps and Power Automate. Competition Competitors to Office include software and global application vendors, such as Apple, Cisco Systems, Meta, Google, Okta, Proofpoint, Slack, Symantec, Zoom, and numerous web-based and mobile application competitors as well as local application developers. Apple distributes versions of its pre-installed application software, such as email and calendar products, through its PCs, tablets, and phones. Cisco Systems is using its position in enterprise communications equipment to grow its unified communications business.

We compete by providing powerful, flexible, secure, integrated industry-specific, and easy-to-use productivity and collaboration tools and services that create comprehensive solutions and work well with technologies our customers already have both on-premises or in the cloud. LinkedIn faces competition from online professional networks, recruiting companies, talent management companies, and larger companies that are focusing on talent management and human resource services; job boards; traditional recruiting firms; and companies that provide learning and development products and services. Marketing Solutions competes with online and offline outlets that generate revenue from advertisers and marketers, and Sales Solutions competes with online and offline outlets for companies with lead generation and customer intelligence and insights. Dynamics competes with cloud-based and on-premises business solution providers such as Oracle, Salesforce, and SAP. 12 PART I Item 1 Intelligent Cloud Our Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, private, and hybrid server products and cloud services that can power modern business and developers. This segment primarily comprises: Server Products and Cloud Services Azure is a comprehensive set of cloud services that offer developers, IT professionals, and enterprises freedom to build, deploy, and manage applications on any platform or device. Customers can use Azure through our global network of datacenters for computing, networking, storage, mobile and web application services, AI, IoT, cognitive services, and machine learning. Azure enables customers to devote more resources to development and use of applications that benefit their organizations, rather than managing on-premises hardware and software. Azure revenue is mainly affected by infrastructure-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service consumption-based services, and per user-based services such as Enterprise Mobility + Security. Azure AI offerings provide a competitive advantage as companies seek ways to optimize and scale their business with machine learning. Azure’s purpose-built, AI-optimized infrastructure allows advanced models, including GPT-4 services designed for developers and data scientists, to do more with less. Customers can integrate large language models and develop the next generation of AI apps and services. Our server products are designed to make IT professionals, developers, and their systems more productive and efficient. Server software is integrated server infrastructure and middleware designed to support software applications built on the Windows Server operating system. This includes the server platform, database, business intelligence, storage, management and operations, virtualization, service-oriented architecture platform, security, and identity software. We also license standalone and software development lifecycle tools for software architects, developers, testers, and project managers. Server products revenue is mainly affected by purchases through volume licensing programs, licenses sold to original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”), and retail packaged products. CALs provide access rights to certain server products, including SQL Server and Windows Server, and revenue is reported along with the associated server product. Nuance and GitHub include both cloud and on-premises offerings. Nuance provides healthcare and enterprise AI solutions. GitHub provides a collaboration platform and code hosting service for developers. Enterprise Services Enterprise Services, including Enterprise Support Services, Industry Solutions, and Nuance Professional Services, assist customers in developing, deploying, and managing Microsoft server solutions, Microsoft desktop solutions, and Nuance conversational AI and ambient intelligent solutions, along with providing training and certification to developers and IT professionals on various Microsoft products. Competition Azure faces diverse competition from companies such as Amazon, Google, IBM, Oracle, VMware, and open source offerings. Azure’s competitive advantage includes enabling a hybrid cloud, allowing deployment of existing datacenters with our public cloud into a single, cohesive infrastructure, and the ability to run at a scale that meets the needs of businesses of all sizes and complexities. Our AI offerings compete with AI products from hyperscalers such as Amazon Bedrock, Amazon CodeWhisperer, and Google AI, as well as products from other emerging competitors, many of which are also current or potential partners, including Meta’s LLaMA2 and other open source solutions. Our Enterprise Mobility + Security offerings also compete with products from a range of competitors including identity vendors, security solution vendors, and numerous other security point solution vendors. We believe our cloud’s global scale, coupled with our broad portfolio of identity and security solutions, allows us to effectively solve complex cybersecurity challenges for our customers and differentiates us from the competition. 13 PART I Item 1 Our server products face competition from a wide variety of server operating systems and applications offered by companies with a range of market approaches. Vertically integrated computer manufacturers such as Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and Oracle offer their own versions of the Unix operating system preinstalled on server hardware. Nearly all computer manufacturers offer server hardware for the Linux operating system , and many contribute to Linux operating system development. The competitive position of Linux has also benefited from the large number of compatible applications now produced by many commercial and non-commercial software developers. A number of companies, such as Red Hat, supply versions of Linux. We compete to provide enterprise-wide computing solutions and point solutions with numerous commercial software vendors that offer solutions and middleware technology platforms, software applications for connectivity (both Internet and intranet), security, hosting, database, and e-business servers. IBM and Oracle lead a group of companies focused on the Java Platform Enterprise Edition that competes with our enterprise-wide computing solutions. Commercial competitors for our server applications for PC-based distributed client-server environments include CA Technologies, IBM, and Oracle. Our web application platform software competes with open source software such as Apache, Linux, MySQL, and PHP. In middleware, we compete against Java vendors. Our database, business intelligence, and data warehousing solutions offerings compete with products from IBM, Oracle, SAP, Snowflake, and other companies. Our system management solutions compete with server management and server virtualization platform providers, such as BMC, CA Technologies, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and VMware. Our products for software developers compete against offerings from Adobe, IBM, Oracle, and other companies, and also against open source projects, including Eclipse (sponsored by CA Technologies, IBM, Oracle, and SAP), PHP, and Ruby on Rails. We believe our server products provide customers with advantages in performance, total costs of ownership, and productivity by delivering superior applications, development tools, compatibility with a broad base of hardware and software applications, security, and manageability. Our Enterprise Services business competes with a wide range of companies that provide strategy and business planning, application development, and infrastructure services, including multinational consulting firms and small niche businesses focused on specific technologies. More Personal Computing Our More Personal Computing segment consists of products and services that put customers at the center of the experience with our technology. This segment primarily comprises: Windows The Windows operating system is designed to deliver a more personal computing experience for users by enabling consistency of experience, applications, and information across their devices. Windows OEM revenue is impacted significantly by the number of Windows operating system licenses purchased by OEMs, which they pre-install on the devices they sell. In addition to computing device market volume, Windows OEM revenue is impacted by: 14 PART I Item 1 Windows Commercial revenue, which includes volume licensing of the Windows operating system and Windows cloud services such as Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, is affected mainly by the demand from commercial customers for volume licensing and Software Assurance (“SA”), as well as advanced security offerings. Windows Commercial revenue often reflects the number of information workers in a licensed enterprise and is relatively independent of the number of PCs sold in a given year. Patent licensing includes our programs to license patents we own for use across a broad array of technology areas, including mobile devices and cloud offerings. Windows IoT extends the power of Windows and the cloud to intelligent systems by delivering specialized operating systems, tools, and services for use in embedded devices. Devices We design and sell devices, including Surface, HoloLens, and PC accessories. Our devices are designed to enable people and organizations to connect to the people and content that matter most using Windows and integrated Microsoft products and services. Surface is designed to help organizations, students, and consumers be more productive. Growth in Devices is dependent on total PC shipments, the ability to attract new customers, our product roadmap, and expanding into new categories. Gaming Our gaming platform is designed to provide a variety of entertainment through a unique combination of content, community, and cloud services. Our exclusive game content is created through Xbox Game Studios, a collection of first-party studios creating iconic and differentiated gaming experiences. We continue to invest in new gaming studios and content to expand our intellectual property roadmap and leverage new content creators. These unique gaming experiences are the cornerstone of Xbox Game Pass, a subscription service and gaming community with access to a curated library of over 400 first- and third-party console and PC titles. The gamer remains at the heart of the Xbox ecosystem. We are identifying new opportunities to attract gamers across a variety of different end points through our first- and third-party content and business diversification across subscriptions, ads, and digital stores. We’ve seen new devices from third-party manufacturers along with key PC and mobile end points that help us empower gamers to play in a way that is most convenient to them. We are focused on growing the platform and expanding to new ecosystems to engage as many gamers as possible. Xbox enables people to connect and share online gaming experiences that are accessible on Xbox consoles, Windows-enabled devices, and other devices. Xbox is designed to benefit users by providing access to a network of certified applications and services and to benefit our developer and partner ecosystems by providing access to a large customer base. Xbox revenue is mainly affected by subscriptions and sales of first- and third-party content, as well as advertising. Growth of our Gaming business is determined by the overall active user base through Xbox enabled content, availability of games, providing exclusive game content that gamers seek, the computational power and reliability of the devices used to access our content and services, and the ability to create new experiences through first-party content creators. 15 PART I Item 1 Search and News Advertising Our Search and news advertising business is designed to deliver relevant search, native, and display advertising to a global audience. Our Microsoft Edge browser and Bing Chat capabilities are key tools to enable user acquisition and engagement, while our technology platform enables accelerated delivery of digital advertising solutions. In addition to first-party tools, we have several partnerships with companies, such as Yahoo, through which we provide and monetize search offerings. Growth depends on our ability to attract new users, understand intent, and match intent with relevant content on advertising offerings. Competition Windows faces competition from various software products and from alternative platforms and devices, mainly from Apple and Google. We believe Windows competes effectively by giving customers choice, value, flexibility, security, an easy-to-use interface, and compatibility with a broad range of hardware and software applications, including those that enable productivity. Devices face competition from various computer, tablet, and hardware manufacturers who offer a unique combination of high-quality industrial design and innovative technologies across various price points. These manufacturers, many of which are also current or potential partners and customers, include Apple and our Windows OEMs. Xbox and our cloud gaming services face competition from various online gaming ecosystems and game streaming services, including those operated by Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Tencent. We also compete with other providers of entertainment services such as video streaming platforms. Our gaming platform competes with console platforms from Nintendo and Sony, both of which have a large, established base of customers. We believe our gaming platform is effectively positioned against, and uniquely differentiated from, competitive products and services based on significant innovation in hardware architecture, user interface, developer tools, online gaming and entertainment services, and continued strong exclusive content from our own first-party game franchises as well as other digital content offerings. Our Search and news advertising business competes with Google and a wide array of websites, social platforms like Meta, and portals that provide content and online offerings to end users. OPERATIONS We have regional operations service centers that support our operations, including customer contract and order processing, billing, credit and collections, information processing, and vendor management and logistics. The center in Ireland supports the African, Asia-Pacific, European, and Middle East regions; and the centers in Arlington, Virginia, Atlanta, Georgia, Charlotte, North Carolina, Fargo, North Dakota, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Redmond, Washington, Reno, Nevada, and Puerto Rico support the American regions. In addition to our operations centers, we also operate datacenters throughout each of these regions. We continue to identify and evaluate opportunities to expand our datacenter locations and increase our server capacity to meet the evolving needs of our customers, particularly given the growing demand for AI services. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land, predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units (“GPUs”) and other components. Our devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However, some of our products contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. Extended disruptions at these suppliers could impact our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand. 16 PART I Item 1 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Product and Service Development, and Intellectual Property We develop most of our products and services internally through the following engineering groups. Internal development allows us to maintain competitive advantages that come from product differentiation and closer technical control over our products and services. It also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented. We strive to obtain information as early as possible about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software and hardware design. Before releasing new software platforms, and as we make significant modifications to existing platforms, we provide application vendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development, training, and testing. Generally, we also create product documentation internally. We protect our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways. We work actively in the U.S. and internationally to ensure the enforcement of copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other protections that apply to our software and hardware products, services, business plans, and branding. We are a leader among technology companies in pursuing patents and currently have a portfolio of over 70,000 U.S. and international patents issued and over 19,000 pending worldwide. While we employ much of our internally-developed intellectual property in our products and services, we also engage in outbound licensing of specific patented technologies that are incorporated into licensees’ products. From time to time, we enter into broader cross-license agreements with other technology companies covering entire groups of patents. We may also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products and services. At times, we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective, such as promoting industry standards, advancing interoperability, supporting societal and/or environmental efforts, or attracting and enabling our external development community. Our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and services, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. We believe our continuing research and product development are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products. 17 PART I Item 1 Investing in the Future Our success is based on our ability to create new and compelling products, services, and experiences for our users, to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new geographic and product markets, and to drive broad adoption of our products and services. We invest in a range of emerging technology trends and breakthroughs that we believe offer significant opportunities to deliver value to our customers and growth for the company. Based on our assessment of key technology trends, we maintain our long-term commitment to research and development across a wide spectrum of technologies, tools, and platforms spanning digital work and life experiences, cloud computing, AI, devices, and operating systems. While our main product research and development facilities are located in Redmond, Washington, we also operate research and development facilities in other parts of the U.S. and around the world. This global approach helps us remain competitive in local markets and enables us to continue to attract top talent from across the world. We plan to continue to make significant investments in a broad range of product research and development activities, and as appropriate we will coordinate our research and development across operating segments and leverage the results across the company. In addition to our main research and development operations, we also operate Microsoft Research. Microsoft Research is one of the world’s largest corporate research organizations, often working in close collaboration with top universities around the world, and is focused on advancing the state-of-the-art in computer science and a broad range of other disciplines. Our investment in fundamental research provides us a unique perspective on future trends and contributes to our innovation. DISTRIBUTION, SALES, AND MARKETING We market and distribute our products and services through the following channels: OEMs, direct, and distributors and resellers. Our sales organization performs a variety of functions, including working directly with commercial enterprises and public-sector organizations worldwide to identify and meet their technology and digital transformation requirements; managing OEM relationships; and supporting system integrators, independent software vendors, and other partners who engage directly with our customers to perform sales, consulting, and fulfillment functions for our products and services. OEMs We distribute our products and services through OEMs that pre-install our software on new devices and servers they sell. The largest component of the OEM business is the Windows operating system pre-installed on devices. OEMs also sell devices pre-installed with other Microsoft products and services, including applications such as Office and the capability to subscribe to Office 365. There are two broad categories of OEMs. The largest category of OEMs are direct OEMs as our relationship with them is managed through a direct agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all the multinational OEMs, including Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, and with many regional and local OEMs. The second broad category of OEMs are system builders consisting of lower-volume PC manufacturers, which source Microsoft software for pre-installation and local redistribution primarily through the Microsoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft. Direct Many organizations that license our products and services transact directly with us through Enterprise Agreements and Enterprise Services contracts, with sales support from system integrators, independent software vendors, web agencies, and partners that advise organizations on licensing our products and services (“Enterprise Agreement Software Advisors” or “ESA”). Microsoft offers direct sales programs targeted to reach small, medium, and corporate customers, in addition to those offered through the reseller channel. A large network of partner advisors support many of these sales. We also sell commercial and consumer products and services directly to customers, such as cloud services, search, and gaming, through our digital marketplaces and online stores. Additionally, our Microsoft Experience Centers are designed to facilitate deeper engagement with our partners and customers across industries. 18 PART I Item 1 Distributors and Resellers Organizations also license our products and services indirectly, primarily through licensing solution partners (“LSP”), distributors, value-added resellers (“VAR”), and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner may reach organizations of all sizes, LSPs are primarily engaged with large organizations, distributors resell primarily to VARs, and VARs typically reach small and medium organizations. ESAs are also typically authorized as LSPs and operate as resellers for our other volume licensing programs. Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider is our main partner program for reselling cloud services. We distribute our retail packaged products primarily through independent non-exclusive distributors, authorized replicators, resellers, and retail outlets. Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets. We distribute our devices through third-party retailers. We have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers and provide product training and sales support. Our Dynamics business solutions are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and specialized services. LICENSING OPTIONS We offer options for organizations that want to purchase our cloud services, on-premises software, and SA. We license software to organizations under volume licensing agreements to allow the customer to acquire multiple licenses of products and services instead of having to acquire separate licenses through retail channels. We use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations of various sizes. While these programs may differ in various parts of the world, generally they include those discussed below. SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades for perpetual licenses released over the contract period. It also provides support, tools, training, and other licensing benefits to help customers deploy and use software efficiently. SA is included with certain volume licensing agreements and is an optional purchase with others. Volume Licensing Programs Enterprise Agreement Enterprise Agreements offer large organizations a manageable volume licensing program that gives them the flexibility to buy cloud services and software licenses under one agreement. Enterprise Agreements are designed for medium or large organizations that want to license cloud services and on-premises software organization-wide over a three-year period. Organizations can elect to purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses. SA is included. Microsoft Customer Agreement A Microsoft Customer Agreement is a simplified purchase agreement presented, accepted, and stored through a digital experience. A Microsoft Customer Agreement is a non-expiring agreement that is designed to support all customers over time, whether purchasing through a partner or directly from Microsoft. Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement A Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement is designed for small and medium organizations that want to subscribe to, activate, provision, and maintain cloud services seamlessly and directly via the web. The agreement allows customers to acquire monthly or annual subscriptions for cloud-based services. Microsoft Products and Services Agreement Microsoft Products and Services Agreements are designed for medium and large organizations that want to license cloud services and on-premises software as needed, with no organization-wide commitment, under a single, non-expiring agreement. Organizations purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses. SA is optional for customers that purchase perpetual licenses. 19 PART I Item 1 Open Value Open Value agreements are a simple, cost-effective way to acquire the latest Microsoft technology. These agreements are designed for small and medium organizations that want to license cloud services and on-premises software over a three-year period. Under Open Value agreements, organizations can elect to purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses and SA is included. Select Plus A Select Plus agreement is designed for government and academic organizations to acquire on-premises licenses at any affiliate or department level, while realizing advantages as one organization. Organizations purchase perpetual licenses and SA is optional. Partner Programs The Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider Program offers customers an easy way to license the cloud services they need in combination with the value-added services offered by their systems integrator, managed services provider, or cloud reseller partner. Partners in this program can easily package their own products and services to directly provision, manage, and support their customer subscriptions. The Microsoft Services Provider License Agreement allows hosting service providers and independent software vendors who want to license eligible Microsoft software products to provide software services and hosted applications to their end customers. Partners license software over a three-year period and are billed monthly based on consumption. The Independent Software Vendor Royalty Program enables partners to integrate Microsoft products into other applications and then license the unified business solution to their end users. CUSTOMERS Our customers include individual consumers, small and medium organizations, large global enterprises, public-sector institutions, Internet service providers, application developers, and OEMs. Our practice is to ship our products promptly upon receipt of purchase orders from customers; consequently, backlog is not significant.

RIS K FACTORS Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock. STRATEGIC AND COMPETITIVE RISKS We face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins. Competition in the technology sector Our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small, specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical, marketing, and financial resources. Barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products, devices, and services that appeal to businesses and consumers. Competition among platform-based ecosystems An important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions. A well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users, application developers, and the platform provider that can accelerate growth. Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins. We face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms. 23 PART I Item 1A Business model competition Companies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models. The competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for research and development, marketing, and sales incentives. This may lead to lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income. Our increasing focus on cloud-based services presents execution and competitive risks. A growing part of our business involves cloud-based services available across the spectrum of computing devices. Our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building best-in-class platforms and productivity services that utilize ubiquitous computing and ambient intelligence to drive insights and productivity gains. At the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and business customers. Pricing and delivery models are evolving. Devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user’s choice of which cloud-based services to use. Certain industries and customers have specific requirements for cloud services and may present enhanced risks. We are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies. The Windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment. We embrace cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation. Our intelligent cloud and intelligent edge offerings are connected to the growth of the Internet of Things (“IoT”), a network of distributed and interconnected devices employing sensors, data, and computing capabilities, including AI. Our success in driving ubiquitous computing and ambient intelligence will depend on the level of adoption of our offerings such as Azure, Azure AI, and Azure IoT Edge. We may not establish market share sufficient to achieve scale necessary to meet our business objectives. Besides software development costs, we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services. These costs will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved. Whether we succeed in cloud-based services depends on our execution in several areas, including: 24 PART I Item 1A It is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed. If we are not effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services, we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above. This may negatively impact gross margins and operating income. Some users may engage in fraudulent or abusive activities through our cloud-based services. These include unauthorized use of accounts through stolen credentials, use of stolen credit cards or other payment vehicles, failure to pay for services accessed, or other activities that violate our terms of service such as cryptocurrency mining or launching cyberattacks. If our efforts to detect such violations or our actions to control these types of fraud and abuse are not effective, we may experience adverse impacts to our revenue or incur reputational damage. RISKS RELATING TO THE EVOLUTION OF OUR BUSINESS We make significant investments in products and services that may not achieve expected returns. We will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the Windows operating system, Microsoft 365, Bing, SQL Server, Windows Server, Azure, Office 365, Xbox, LinkedIn, and other products and services. In addition, we are focused on developing new AI platform services and incorporating AI into existing products and services. We also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment, including PCs, tablets, gaming devices, and HoloLens. Investments in new technology are speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. We may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. New products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically. We may not get engagement in certain features, like Microsoft Edge, Bing, and Bing Chat, that drive post-sale monetization opportunities. Our data handling practices across our products and services will continue to be under scrutiny. Perceptions of mismanagement, driven by regulatory activity or negative public reaction to our practices or product experiences, could negatively impact product and feature adoption, product design, and product quality. Developing new technologies is complex. It can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue. Acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business. We expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. For example, in March 2021 we completed our acquisition of ZeniMax Media Inc. for $8.1 billion, and in March 2022 we completed our acquisition of Nuance Communications, Inc. for $18.8 billion. In January 2022 we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Activision Blizzard , Inc. for $68.7 billion. In January 2023 we announced the third phase of our OpenAI strategic partnership. Acquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks, including that they do not advance our business strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment, that they raise new compliance-related obligations and challenges, that we have difficulty integrating and retaining new employees, business systems, and technology, that they distract management from our other businesses, or that announced transactions may not be completed. If an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party, it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement. The success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones, as well as acquired companies’ ability to meet our policies and processes in areas such as data governance, privacy, and cybersecurity. It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements such as increased revenue or enhanced efficiencies, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected. These events could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements. 25 PART I Item 1A If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings. We acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. We review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate. We have in the past recorded, and may in the future be required to record, a significant charge in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively affecting our results of operations. CYBERSECURITY, DATA PRIVACY, AND PLATFORM ABUSE RISKS Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our reputation or competitive position. Security of our information technology Threats to IT security can take a variety of forms. Individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including state-sponsored organizations or nation-states, continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our IT. These actors may use a wide variety of methods, which may include developing and deploying malicious software or exploiting vulnerabilities or intentionally designed processes in hardware, software, or other infrastructure in order to attack our products and services or gain access to our networks and datacenters, using social engineering techniques to induce our employees, users, partners, or customers to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users’ or customers’ data, or acting in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks. Nation-state and state-sponsored actors can deploy significant resources to plan and carry out attacks. Nation-state attacks against us, our customers, or our partners may intensify during periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Inadequate account security or organizational security practices may also result in unauthorized access to confidential data. For example, system administrators may fail to timely remove employee account access when no longer appropriate. Employees or third parties may intentionally compromise our or our users’ security or systems or reveal confidential information. Malicious actors may employ the IT supply chain to introduce malware through software updates or compromised supplier accounts or hardware. Cyberthreats are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. We may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities or new attack methods, which may allow them to persist in the environment over long periods of time. Cyberthreats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and customers. Breaches of our facilities, network, or data security could disrupt the security of our systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in product development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, subject us to ransomware attacks, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies or remediate the impacts of attacks, or otherwise adversely affect our business. We are also subject to supply chain cyberattacks where malware can be introduced to a software provider’s customers, including us, through software updates. In addition, our internal IT environment continues to evolve. Often, we are early adopters of new devices and technologies. We embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies. Increasing use of generative AI models in our internal systems may create new attack methods for adversaries. Our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge, or emerging cybersecurity regulations in jurisdictions worldwide. 26 PART I Item 1A Security of our products, services, devices, and customers’ data The security of our products and services is important in our customers’ decisions to purchase or use our products or services across cloud and on-premises environments. Security threats are a significant challenge to companies like us whose business is providing technology products and services to others. Threats to our own IT infrastructure can also affect our customers. Customers using our cloud-based services rely on the security of our infrastructure, including hardware and other elements provided by third parties, to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data. Adversaries tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and services, including many of ours, and we expect that to continue. In addition, adversaries can attack our customers’ on-premises or cloud environments, sometimes exploiting previously unknown (“zero day”) vulnerabilities, such as occurred in early calendar year 2021 with several of our Exchange Server on-premises products. Vulnerabilities in these or any product can persist even after we have issued security patches if customers have not installed the most recent updates, or if the attackers exploited the vulnerabilities before patching to install additional malware to further compromise customers’ systems. Adversaries will continue to attack customers using our cloud services as customers embrace digital transformation. Adversaries that acquire user account information can use that information to compromise our users’ accounts, including where accounts share the same attributes such as passwords. Inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access, and user activity may result in ransomware or other malicious software impacting a customer’s use of our products or services. We are increasingly incorporating open source software into our products. There may be vulnerabilities in open source software that may make our products susceptible to cyberattacks. Additionally, we are actively adding new generative AI features to our services. Because generative AI is a new field, understanding of security risks and protection methods continues to develop; features that rely on generative AI may be susceptible to unanticipated security threats from sophisticated adversaries. Our customers operate complex IT systems with third-party hardware and software from multiple vendors that may include systems acquired over many years. They expect our products and services to support all these systems and products, including those that no longer incorporate the strongest current security advances or standards. As a result, we may not be able to discontinue support in our services for a product, service, standard, or feature solely because a more secure alternative is available. Failure to utilize the most current security advances and standards can increase our customers’ vulnerability to attack. Further, customers of widely varied size and technical sophistication use our technology, and consequently may still have limited capabilities and resources to help them adopt and implement state of the art cybersecurity practices and technologies. In addition, we must account for this wide variation of technical sophistication when defining default settings for our products and services, including security default settings, as these settings may limit or otherwise impact other aspects of IT operations and some customers may have limited capability to review and reset these defaults. Cyberattacks may adversely impact our customers even if our production services are not directly compromised. We are committed to notifying our customers whose systems have been impacted as we become aware and have actionable information for customers to help protect themselves. We are also committed to providing guidance and support on detection, tracking, and remediation. We may not be able to detect the existence or extent of these attacks for all of our customers or have information on how to detect or track an attack, especially where an attack involves on-premises software such as Exchange Server where we may have no or limited visibility into our customers’ computing environments. Development and deployment of defensive measures To defend against security threats to our internal IT systems, our cloud-based services, and our customers’ systems, we must continuously engineer more secure products and services, enhance security, threat detection, and reliability features, improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities in our own products as well as those provided by others, develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network, products, and services, and provide security tools such as firewalls, anti-virus software, and advanced security and information about the need to deploy security measures and the impact of doing so. Customers in certain industries such as financial services, health care, and government may have enhanced or specialized requirements to which we must engineer our products and services. 27 PART I Item 1A The cost of measures to protect products and customer-facing services could reduce our operating margins. If we fail to do these things well, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services, data corruption issues, or reduced performance could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services, or to use competing products or services. Customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional products or services. Customers, and third parties granted access to their systems, may fail to update their systems, continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support, or may fail timely to install or enable security patches, or may otherwise fail to adopt adequate security practices. Any of these could adversely affect our reputation and revenue. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. Our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, but there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges. At times, to achieve commercial objectives, we may enter into agreements with larger liability exposure to customers. Our products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem of third parties. If there is a security vulnerability in one of these components, and if there is a security exploit targeting it, we could face increased costs, liability claims, reduced revenue, or harm to our reputation or competitive position. Disclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation. As we continue to grow the number, breadth, and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personal data of our customers and users. The continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. Despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and third parties on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure or misuse of customer or user data we or our vendors store and manage. In addition, third parties who have limited access to our customer or user data may use this data in unauthorized ways. Improper disclosure or misuse could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers or users, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Our software products and services also enable our customers and users to store and process personal data on-premises or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment we host. Government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer or user data in response to valid legal orders. In the U.S. and elsewhere, we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure. Despite our efforts to protect customer and user data, perceptions that the collection, use, and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities. Additional security measures we may take to address customer or user concerns, or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer or user expectations or governmental rules or actions, may cause higher operating expenses or hinder growth of our products and services. We may not be able to protect information in our products and services from use by others . LinkedIn and other Microsoft products and services contain valuable information and content protected by contractual restrictions or technical measures. In certain cases, we have made commitments to our members and users to limit access to or use of this information. Changes in the law or interpretations of the law may weaken our ability to prevent third parties from scraping or gathering information or content through use of bots or other measures and using it for their own benefit, thus diminishing the value of our products and services. Abuse of our platforms may harm our reputation or user engagement. Advertising, professional, marketplace, and gaming platform abuses For platform products and services that provide content or host ads that come from or can be influenced by third parties, including GitHub, LinkedIn, Microsoft Advertising, Microsoft News, Microsoft Store, Bing, and Xbox, our reputation or user engagement may be negatively affected by activity that is hostile or inappropriate. This activity may come from users impersonating other people or organizations including through the use of AI technologies, dissemination of information that may be viewed as misleading or intended to manipulate the opinions of our users, or the use of our products or services that violates our terms of service or otherwise for objectionable or illegal ends. Preventing or responding to these actions may require us to make substantial investments in people and technology and these investments may not be successful, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements. 28 PART I Item 1A Other digital safety abuses Our hosted consumer services as well as our enterprise services may be used to generate or disseminate harmful or illegal content in violation of our terms or applicable law. We may not proactively discover such content due to scale, the limitations of existing technologies, and conflicting legal frameworks. When discovered by users and others, such content may negatively affect our reputation, our brands, and user engagement. Regulations and other initiatives to make platforms responsible for preventing or eliminating harmful content online have been enacted, and we expect this to continue. We may be subject to enhanced regulatory oversight, civil or criminal liability, or reputational damage if we fail to comply with content moderation regulations, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements. The development of the IoT presents security, privacy, and execution risks. To support the growth of the intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge, we are developing products, services, and technologies to power the IoT. The IoT’s great potential also carries substantial risks. IoT products and services may contain defects in design, manufacture, or operation that make them insecure or ineffective for their intended purposes. An IoT solution has multiple layers of hardware, sensors, processors, software, and firmware, several of which we may not develop or control. Each layer, including the weakest layer, can impact the security of the whole system. Many IoT devices have limited interfaces and ability to be updated or patched. IoT solutions may collect large amounts of data, and our handling of IoT data may not satisfy customers or regulatory requirements. IoT scenarios may increasingly affect personal health and safety. If IoT solutions that include our technologies do not work as intended, violate the law, or harm individuals or businesses, we may be subject to legal claims or enforcement actions. These risks, if realized, may increase our costs, damage our reputation or brands, or negatively impact our revenues or margins. Issues in the development and use of AI may result in reputational or competitive harm or liability . We are building AI into many of our offerings, including our productivity services, and we are also making AI available for our customers to use in solutions that they build. This AI may be developed by Microsoft or others, including our strategic partner, OpenAI. We expect these elements of our business to grow. We envision a future in which AI operating in our devices, applications, and the cloud helps our customers be more productive in their work and personal lives. As with many innovations, AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. AI algorithms or training methodologies may be flawed. Datasets may be overbroad, insufficient, or contain biased information. Content generated by AI systems may be offensive, illegal, or otherwise harmful. Ineffective or inadequate AI development or deployment practices by Microsoft or others could result in incidents that impair the acceptance of AI solutions or cause harm to individuals, customers, or society, or result in our products and services not working as intended. Human review of certain outputs may be required. As a result of these and other challenges associated with innovative technologies, our implementation of AI systems could subject us to competitive harm, regulatory action, legal liability, including under new proposed legislation regulating AI in jurisdictions such as the European Union (“EU”), new applications of existing data protection, privacy, intellectual property, and other laws, and brand or reputational harm. Some AI scenarios present ethical issues or may have broad impacts on society. If we enable or offer AI solutions that have unintended consequences, unintended usage or customization by our customers and partners, or are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or other social, economic, or political issues, we may experience brand or reputational harm, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements. 29 PART I Item 1A OPERATIONAL RISKS We may have excessive outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure. Our increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power. We spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land, predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units (“GPUs”) and other components. The cost or availability of these dependencies could be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including the transition to a clean energy economy, local and regional environmental regulations, and geopolitical disruptions. These demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth and the augmentation of existing services such as Bing, Azure, Microsoft Account services, Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams, Dynamics 365, OneDrive, SharePoint Online, Skype, Xbox, and Outlook.com through the incorporation of AI features and/or functionality. We are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users. Maintaining, securing, and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex, and requires development of principles for datacenter builds in geographies with higher safety and reliability risks. It requires that we maintain an Internet connectivity infrastructure and storage and compute capacity that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve. Inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data, insufficient Internet connectivity, insufficient or unavailable power supply, or inadequate storage and compute capacity, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, regulatory actions, damage to our reputation, and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may adversely impact our consolidated financial statements. We may experience quality or supply problems. Our hardware products such as Xbox consoles, Surface devices, and other devices we design and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. We could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm as a result of recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims if we fail to prevent, detect, or address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs. Our software products and services also may experience quality or reliability problems. The highly sophisticated software we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. Our customers increasingly rely on us for critical business functions and multiple workloads. Many of our products and services are interdependent with one another. Each of these circumstances potentially magnifies the impact of quality or reliability issues. Any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability. Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge. There are limited suppliers for certain device and datacenter components. Our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us. If components are delayed or become unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint, industry shortages, legal or regulatory changes that restrict supply sources, or other reasons, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity to support the delivery and continued development of our products and services. Component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue. Xbox consoles, Surface devices, datacenter servers, and other hardware are assembled in Asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins. LEGAL, REGULATORY, AND LITIGATION RISKS Government litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products. Government agencies closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign competition laws. Governments are actively enforcing competition laws and regulations, and this includes scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the EU, the U.S., and China. Some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. U.S. federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business. 30 PART I Item 1A For example, the European Commission (“the Commission”) closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume Microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. Flagship product releases such as Windows can receive significant scrutiny under EU or other competition laws. Our portfolio of first-party devices continues to grow; at the same time our OEM partners offer a large variety of devices for our platforms. As a result, increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our OEM partners, creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules. Regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase. Certain foreign governments, particularly in China and other countries in Asia, have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property. Competition law regulatory actions and court decisions may result in fines or hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses, reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that comes from them. New competition law actions could be initiated, potentially using previous actions as precedent. The outcome of such actions, or steps taken to avoid them, could adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including causing us to withdraw products from or modify products for certain markets, decreasing the value of our assets, adversely affecting our ability to monetize our products, or inhibiting our ability to consummate acquisition or impose conditions on acquisitions that may reduce their value. Laws and regulations relating to anti-corruption and trade could result in increased costs, fines, criminal penalties, or reputational damage. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other anti-corruption laws and regulations (“Anti-Corruption Laws”) prohibit corrupt payments by our employees, vendors, or agents, and the accounting provisions of the FCPA require us to maintain accurate books and records and adequate internal controls. From time to time, we receive inquiries from authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere which may be based on reports from employees and others about our business activities outside the U.S. and our compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws. Periodically, we receive such reports directly and investigate them, and also cooperate with investigations by U.S. and foreign law enforcement authorities. An example of increasing international regulatory complexity is the EU Whistleblower Directive, initiated in 2021, which may present compliance challenges to the extent it is implemented in different forms by EU member states. Most countries in which we operate also have competition laws that prohibit competitors from colluding or otherwise attempting to reduce competition between themselves. While we devote substantial resources to our U.S. and international compliance programs and have implemented policies, training, and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments and collusive activity, our employees, vendors, or agents may violate our policies. Our failure to comply with Anti-Corruption Laws or competition laws could result in significant fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Increasing trade laws, policies, sanctions, and other regulatory requirements also affect our operations in and outside the U.S. relating to trade and investment. Economic sanctions in the U.S., the EU, and other countries prohibit most business with restricted entities or countries. U.S. export controls restrict Microsoft from offering many of its products and services to, or making investments in, certain entities in specified countries. U.S. import controls restrict us from integrating certain information and communication technologies into our supply chain and allow for government review of transactions involving information and communications technology from countries determined to be foreign adversaries. Supply chain regulations may impact the availability of goods or result in additional regulatory scrutiny. Periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, may result in (1) new and rapidly evolving sanctions and trade restrictions, which may impair trade with sanctioned individuals and countries, and (2) negative impacts to regional trade ecosystems among our customers, partners, and us. Non-compliance with sanctions as well as general ecosystem disruptions could result in reputational harm, operational delays, monetary fines, loss of revenues, increased costs, loss of export privileges, or criminal sanctions. 31 PART I Item 1A Laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased costs, legal claims, fines against us, or reputational damage. The growth of our Internet- and cloud-based services internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries. Legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, and transfer of personal data continue to evolve. For example, while the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“DPF”) has been recognized as adequate under EU law to allow transfers of personal data from the EU to certified companies in the U.S., the DPF is subject to further legal challenge which could cause the legal requirements for data transfers from the EU to be uncertain. EU data protection authorities have and may again block the use of certain U.S.-based services that involve the transfer of data to the U.S. In the EU and other markets, potential new rules and restrictions on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services. In addition, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to products and services offered in the EU, imposes a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data. More recently, the EU has been developing new requirements related to the use of data, including in the Digital Markets Act, the Digital Services Act, and the Data Act, that add additional rules and restriction on the use of data in our products and services. Engineering efforts to build and maintain capabilities to facilitate compliance with these laws involve substantial expense and the diversion of engineering resources from other projects. We might experience reduced demand for our offerings if we are unable to engineer products that meet our legal duties or help our customers meet their obligations under these and other data regulations, or if our implementation to comply makes our offerings less attractive. Compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them. If we fail to comply, or if regulators assert we have failed to comply (including in response to complaints made by customers), it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions, which can result in significant monetary penalties, private lawsuits, reputational damage, blockage of international data transfers, and loss of customers. The highest fines assessed under GDPR have recently been increasing, especially against large technology companies. Jurisdictions around the world, such as China, India, and states in the U.S. have adopted, or are considering adopting or expanding, laws and regulations imposing obligations regarding the collection, handling, and transfer of personal data. Our investment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the value of the services, including AI services, we deliver to customers, to operational efficiency and key opportunities in monetization, and to customer perceptions of quality. Our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory developments that impede realizing the expected return from this investment. Ongoing legal analyses, reviews, and inquiries by regulators of Microsoft practices, or relevant practices of other organizations, may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements, including data sovereignty and localization requirements, affecting the location, movement, collection, and use of our customer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding personal data may require changes in services, business practices, or internal systems that result in increased costs, lower revenue, reduced efficiency, or greater difficulty in competing with foreign-based firms. Compliance with data regulations might limit our ability to innovate or offer certain features and functionality in some jurisdictions where we operate. Failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity, as well as negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort. Existing and increasing legal and regulatory requirements could adversely affect our results of operations. We are subject to a wide range of laws, regulations, and legal requirements in the U.S. and globally, including those that may apply to our products and online services offerings, and those that impose requirements related to user privacy, telecommunications, data storage and protection, advertising, and online content. Laws in several jurisdictions, including EU Member State laws under the European Electronic Communications Code, increasingly define certain of our services as regulated telecommunications services. This trend may continue and will result in these offerings being subjected to additional data protection, security, law enforcement surveillance, and other obligations. Regulators and private litigants may assert that our collection, use, and management of customer data and other information is inconsistent with their laws and regulations, including laws that apply to the tracking of users via technology such as cookies. New environmental, social, and governance laws and regulations are expanding mandatory disclosure, reporting, and diligence requirements. Legislative or regulatory action relating to cybersecurity requirements may increase the costs to develop, implement, or secure our products and services. Compliance with evolving digital accessibility laws and standards will require engineering and is important to our efforts to empower all people and organizations to achieve more. Legislative and regulatory action is emerging in the areas of AI and content moderation, which could increase costs or restrict opportunity. For example, in the EU, an AI Act is being considered, and may entail increased costs or decreased opportunities for the operation of our AI services in the European market. 32 PART I Item 1A How these laws and regulations apply to our business is often unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In addition, governments’ approach to enforcement, and our products and services, are continuing to evolve. Compliance with existing, expanding, or new laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that could adversely affect our results of operations. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we cease the alleged noncompliant activity. In addition, there is increasing pressure from advocacy groups, regulators, competitors, customers, and other stakeholders across many of these areas. If our products do not meet customer expectations or legal requirements, we could lose sales opportunities or face regulatory or legal actions. We have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes. We are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. These claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives, including major new product releases such as Windows, AI services, significant business transactions, warranty or product claims, employment practices, and regulation. Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. The litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. A material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Our business with government customers may present additional uncertainties. We derive substantial revenue from government contracts. Government contracts generally can present risks and challenges not present in private commercial agreements. For instance, we may be subject to government audits and investigations relating to these contracts, we could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor, we could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, and under certain circumstances contracts may be rescinded. Some agreements may allow a government to terminate without cause and provide for higher liability limits for certain losses. Some contracts may be subject to periodic funding approval, reductions, cancellations, or delays which could adversely impact public-sector demand for our products and services. These events could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition, and reputation. We may have additional tax liabilities. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, compliance with the 2017 United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) and possible future legislative changes may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the company, the use of estimates in our consolidated financial statements, and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions. As regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the TCJA or possible future legislative changes, and as we gather more information and perform more analysis, our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. Although we believe that our provision for income taxes and our tax estimates are reasonable, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken. In addition, economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. We are currently under Internal Revenue Service audit for prior tax years, with the primary unresolved issues relating to transfer pricing. The final resolution of those audits, and other audits or litigation, may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made. We earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S. A change in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our business or structure, or the expiration of or disputes about certain tax agreements in a particular country may result in higher effective tax rates for the company. In addition, changes in U.S. federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries, including in the U.S., and changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions may materially adversely impact our consolidated financial statements. 33 PART I Item 1A INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS We face risks related to the protection and utilization of our intellectual property that may result in our business and operating results may be harmed. Protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property on a global basis is difficult. Similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights. Changes in the law may continue to weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patents. Additionally, licensees of our patents may fail to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties or may contest the scope and extent of their obligations. Finally, our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our revenue may be adversely affected. Source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. If our source code leaks, we might lose future trade secret protection for that code. It may then become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating results. Unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described elsewhere in these risk factors. Third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property. From time to time, others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. To resolve these claims, we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available, stop selling or redesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. Adverse outcomes could also include monetary damages or injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies. We have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk, and may continue to do so. GENERAL RISKS If our reputation or our brands are damaged, our business and operating results may be harmed . Our reputation and brands are globally recognized and are important to our business. Our reputation and brands affect our ability to attract and retain consumer, business, and public-sector customers. There are numerous ways our reputation or brands could be damaged. These include product safety or quality issues, our environmental impact and sustainability, supply chain practices, or human rights record. We may experience backlash from customers, government entities, advocacy groups, employees, and other stakeholders that disagree with our product offering decisions or public policy positions. Damage to our reputation or our brands may occur from, among other things: The proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood, speed, and magnitude of negative brand events. If our brands or reputation are damaged, it could negatively impact our revenues or margins, or ability to attract the most highly qualified employees. Adverse economic or market conditions may harm our business. Worsening economic conditions, including inflation, recession, pandemic, or other changes in economic conditions, may cause lower IT spending and adversely affect our revenue. If demand for PCs, servers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected. Our product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network. OEMs building devices that run our software have also been a significant means of distribution. The impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, OEM, or retailer, could cause sales channel disruption. Challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. As a result, allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase. 34 PART I Item 1A We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that affect global financial markets. A significant part of our investment portfolio comprises U.S. government securities. If global financial markets decline for long periods, or if there is a downgrade of the U.S. government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt, our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced a decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements. Catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business. A disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyberattack, terrorist attack, pandemic, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other critical functions. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other essential business operations are in the Seattle, Washington area, and we have other business operations in the Silicon Valley area of California, both of which are seismically active regions. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems, or the infrastructure or systems they rely on, such as power grids, could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations. Providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages in our consolidated financial statements. Abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries, which may increase our operating costs and negatively impact our ability to sell to and collect from customers in affected markets. These conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers. Geopolitical change may result in changing regulatory systems and requirements and market interventions that could impact our operating strategies, access to national, regional, and global markets, hiring, and profitability. Geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some markets or with some public-sector customers. Any of these changes may negatively impact our revenues. The occurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic, such as COVID-19, may adversely affect our operations, financial condition, and results of operations. The extent to which global pandemics impact our business going forward will depend on factors such as the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business, and individuals' actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity, including the possibility of recession or financial market instability. Measures to contain a global pandemic may intensify other risks described in these Risk Factors. We may incur increased costs to effectively manage these aspects of our business. If we are unsuccessful, it may adversely impact our revenues, cash flows, market share growth, and reputation. The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the IT industry in particular are unclear. Environmental regulations or changes in the supply, demand, or available sources of energy or other resources may affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our business. Changes in climate where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud-based services. 35 PART I Item 1A Our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks. Our customers are located throughout the world and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. The global nature of our business creates operational, economic, and geopolitical risks. Our results of operations may be affected by global, regional, and local economic developments, monetary policy, inflation, and recession, as well as political and military disputes. In addition, our international growth strategy includes certain markets, the developing nature of which presents several risks, including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. Emerging nationalist and protectionist trends and concerns about human rights, the environment, and political expression in specific countries may significantly alter the trade and commercial environments. Changes to trade policy or agreements as a result of populism, protectionism, or economic nationalism may result in higher tariffs, local sourcing initiatives, and non-local sourcing restrictions, export controls, investment restrictions, or other developments that make it more difficult to sell our products in foreign countries. Disruptions of these kinds in developed or emerging markets could negatively impact demand for our products and services, impair our ability to operate in certain regions, or increase operating costs. Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our results of operations. Our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees. Our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. Maintaining our brand and reputation, as well as a diverse and inclusive work environment that enables all our employees to thrive, are important to our ability to recruit and retain employees. We are also limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. Changes to U.S. immigration policies that restrain the flow of technical and professional talent may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development efforts. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. How employment-related laws are interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs. Our global workforce is predominantly non-unionized, although we do have some employees in the U.S. and internationally who are represented by unions or works councils. In the U.S., there has been a general increase in workers exercising their right to form or join a union. The unionization of significant employee populations could result in higher costs and other operational changes necessary to respond to changing conditions and to establish new relationships with worker representatives. 36 PART I Item 1B, 2, 3, 4 ITEM 1B.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). This section generally discusses the results of our operations for the year ended June 30, 2023 compared to the year ended June 30, 2022. For a discussion of the year ended June 30 , 2022 compared to the year ended June 30, 2021, please refer to Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2022. OVERVIEW Microsoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. We strive to create local opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world. We are creating the platforms and tools, powered by artificial intelligence (“AI”), that deliver better, faster, and more effective solutions to support small and large business competitiveness, improve educational and health outcomes, grow public-sector efficiency, and empower human ingenuity. We generate revenue by offering a wide range of cloud-based solutions, content, and other services to people and businesses; licensing and supporting an array of software products; delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience; and designing and selling devices. Our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees; supporting and investing in our cloud-based services, including datacenter operations; designing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling our other products and services; and income taxes. Highlights from fiscal year 2023 compared with fiscal year 2022 included: Industry Trends Our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces. 40 PART II Item 7 Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks The markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, influencing how users access services in the cloud and, in some cases, the user’s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is also correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. The investments we are making in cloud and AI infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins. We continue to identify and evaluate opportunities to expand our datacenter locations and increase our server capacity to meet the evolving needs of our customers, particularly given the growing demand for AI services. Our datacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land, predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers, including graphics processing units (“GPUs”) and other components. Our devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However, some of our products contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. Extended disruptions at these suppliers could impact our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand. Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one’s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies reduced reported revenue and expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2023. On January 18, 2023, we announced decisions we made to align our cost structure with our revenue and customer demand, prioritize our investments in strategic areas, and consolidate office space. As a result, we recorded a $1.2 billion charge in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 (“Q2 charge”), which included employee severance expenses of $800 million, impairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activities. First, we reduced our overall workforce by approximately 10,000 jobs through the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 related to the Q2 charge, which represents less than 5% of our total employee base. While we eliminated roles in some areas, we will continue to hire in key strategic areas. Second, we are allocating both our capital and talent to areas of secular growth and long-term competitiveness, while divesting in other areas. Third, we are consolidating our leases to create higher density across our workspaces, which impacted our financial results through the remainder of fiscal year 2023, and we may make similar decisions in future periods as we continue to evaluate our real estate needs. Refer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) for a discussion of these factors and other risks. Seasonality Our revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Second quarter revenue is driven by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period. Change in Accounting Estimate In July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four years to six years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023. Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and equipment, net as of June 30, 2022, the effect of this change in estimate for fiscal year 2023 was an increase in operating income of $3.7 billion and net income of $3.0 billion, or $0.40 per both basic and diluted share. 41 PART II Item 7 Reportable Segments We report our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing. The segment amounts included in MD&A are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting. We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the way we internally manage and monitor our business. Additional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 19 – Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). Metrics We use metrics in assessing the performance of our business and to make informed decisions regarding the allocation of resources. We disclose metrics to enable investors to evaluate progress against our ambitions, provide transparency into performance trends, and reflect the continued evolution of our products and services. Our commercial and other business metrics are fundamentally connected based on how customers use our products and services. The metrics are disclosed in the MD&A or the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). Financial metrics are calculated based on financial results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), and growth comparisons relate to the corresponding period of last fiscal year. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, we made updates to the presentation and method of calculation for certain metrics, most notably expanding our Surface metric into a broader Devices metric to incorporate additional revenue streams, along with other minor changes to align with how we manage our businesses. Commercial Our commercial business primarily consists of Server products and cloud services, Office Commercial, Windows Commercial, the commercial portion of LinkedIn, Enterprise Services, and Dynamics. Our commercial metrics allow management and investors to assess the overall health of our commercial business and include leading indicators of future performance. Commercial remaining performance obligation Commercial portion of revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations, which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods Microsoft Cloud revenue Revenue from Azure and other cloud services, Office 365 Commercial, the commercial portion of LinkedIn, Dynamics 365, and other commercial cloud properties Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage Gross margin percentage for our Microsoft Cloud business 42 PART II Item 7 Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud Metrics related to our Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud segments assess the health of our core businesses within these segments. The metrics reflect our cloud and on-premises product strategies and trends. Office Commercial products and cloud services revenue growth Revenue from Office Commercial products and cloud services (Office 365 subscriptions, the Office 365 portion of Microsoft 365 Commercial subscriptions, and Office licensed on-premises), comprising Office, Exchange, SharePoint, Microsoft Teams, Office 365 Security and Compliance, Microsoft Viva, and Microsoft 365 Copilot Office Consumer products and cloud services revenue growth Revenue from Office Consumer products and cloud services, including Microsoft 365 Consumer subscriptions, Office licensed on-premises, and other Office services Office 365 Commercial seat growth The number of Office 365 Commercial seats at end of period where seats are paid users covered by an Office 365 Commercial subscription Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers The number of Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers at end of period Dynamics products and cloud services revenue growth Revenue from Dynamics products and cloud services, including Dynamics 365, comprising a set of intelligent, cloud-based applications across ERP, CRM (including Customer Insights), Power Apps, and Power Automate; and on-premises ERP and CRM applications LinkedIn revenue growth Revenue from LinkedIn, including Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, Premium Subscriptions, and Sales Solutions Server products and cloud services revenue growth Revenue from Server products and cloud services, including Azure and other cloud services; SQL Server, Windows Server, Visual Studio, System Center, and related Client Access Licenses (“CALs”); and Nuance and GitHub More Personal Computing Metrics related to our More Personal Computing segment assess the performance of key lines of business within this segment. These metrics provide strategic product insights which allow us to assess the performance across our commercial and consumer businesses. As we have diversity of target audiences and sales motions within the Windows business, we monitor metrics that are reflective of those varying motions. Windows OEM revenue growth Revenue from sales of Windows Pro and non-Pro licenses sold through the OEM channel Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue growth Revenue from Windows Commercial products and cloud services, comprising volume licensing of the Windows operating system, Windows cloud services, and other Windows commercial offerings Devices revenue growth Revenue from Devices, including Surface, HoloLens, and PC accessories Xbox content and services revenue growth Revenue from Xbox content and services, comprising first- and third-party content (including games and in-game content), Xbox Game Pass and other subscriptions, Xbox Cloud Gaming, advertising, third-party disc royalties, and other cloud services Search and news advertising revenue (ex TAC) growth Revenue from search and news advertising excluding traffic acquisition costs (“TAC”) paid to Bing Ads network publishers and news partners 43 PART II Item 7 SUMMARY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (In millions, except percentages and per share amounts) 2023 2022 Percentage Change Revenue $ 211,915 $ 198,270 7% Gross margin 146,052 135,620 8% Operating income 88,523 83,383 6% Net income 72,361 72,738 (1)% Diluted earnings per share 9.68 9.65 0% Adjusted gross margin (non-GAAP) 146,204 135,620 8% Adjusted operating income (non-GAAP) 89,694 83,383 8% Adjusted net income (non-GAAP) 73,307 69,447 6% Adjusted diluted earnings per share (non-GAAP) 9.81 9.21 7% Adjusted gross margin, operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) are non-GAAP financial measures. Current year non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of the Q2 charge, which includes employee severance expenses, impairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activities. Prior year non-GAAP financial measures exclude the net income tax benefit related to transfer of intangible properties in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. Refer to Note 12 – Income Taxes of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. Refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section below for a reconciliation of our financial results reported in accordance with GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. Fiscal Year 2023 Compared with Fiscal Year 2022 Revenue increased $13.6 billion or 7% driven by growth in Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes, offset in part by a decline in More Personal Computing. Intelligent Cloud revenue increased driven by Azure and other cloud services. Productivity and Business Processes revenue increased driven by Office 365 Commercial and LinkedIn. More Personal Computing revenue decreased driven by Windows and Devices. Cost of revenue increased $3.2 billion or 5% driven by growth in Microsoft Cloud , offset in part by the change in accounting estimate. Gross margin increased $10.4 billion or 8% driven by growth in Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes and the change in accounting estimate, offset in part by a decline in More Personal Computing. Operating expenses increased $5.3 billion or 10% driven by employee severance expenses, 2 points of growth from the Nuance and Xandr acquisitions, investments in cloud engineering, and LinkedIn. Operating income increased $5.1 billion or 6% driven by growth in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud and the change in accounting estimate, offset in part by a decline in More Personal Computing. Revenue, gross margin, and operating income included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 4%, 4%, and 6%, respectively. Cost of revenue and operating expenses both included a favorable foreign currency impact of 2%. Current year gross margin, operating income, net income, and diluted EPS were negatively impacted by the Q2 charge, which resulted in decreases of $152 million, $1.2 billion, $946 million, and $0.13, respectively. Prior year net income and diluted EPS were positively impacted by the net tax benefit related to the transfer of intangible properties, which resulted in an increase to net income and diluted EPS of $3.3 billion and $0.44, respectively. 44 PART II Item 7 SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (In millions, except percentages) 2023 2022 Percentage Change Revenue Productivity and Business Processes $ 69,274 $ 63,364 9% Intelligent Cloud 87,907 74,965 17% More Personal Computing 54,734 59,941 (9)% Total $ 211,915 $ 198,270 7% Operating Income Productivity and Business Processes $ 34,189 $ 29,690 15% Intelligent Cloud 37,884 33,203 14% More Personal Computing 16,450 20,490 (20)% Total $ 88,523 $ 83,383 6% Reportable Segments Fiscal Year 2023 Compared with Fiscal Year 2022 Productivity and Business Processes Revenue increased $5.9 billion or 9%.

General and administrative included a favorable foreign currency impact of 2%. 47 PART II Item 7 OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET The components of other income (expense), net were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2023 2022 Interest and dividends income $ 2,994 $ 2,094 Interest expense (1,968 ) (2,063 ) Net recognized gains on investments 260 461 Net losses on derivatives (456 ) (52 ) Net gains (losses) on foreign currency remeasurements 181 (75 ) Other, net (223 ) (32 ) Total $ 788 $ 333 We use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; enhance investment returns; and facilitate portfolio diversification. Gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net. Fiscal Year 2023 Compared with Fiscal Year 2022 Interest and dividends income increased due to higher yields, offset in part by lower portfolio balances. Interest expense decreased due to a decrease in outstanding long-term debt due to debt maturities. Net recognized gains on investments decreased due to lower gains on equity securities and higher losses on fixed income securities. Net losses on derivatives increased due to losses related to managing strategic investments. INCOME TAXES Effective Tax Rate Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2023 and 2022 was 19% and 13%, respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate was primarily due to a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer of intangible properties and a decrease in tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we transferred certain intangible properties from our Puerto Rico subsidiary to the U.S. The transfer of intangible properties resulted in a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, as the value of future U.S. tax deductions exceeded the current tax liability from the U.S. global intangible low-taxed income tax. Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland. The mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. In fiscal year 2023, our U.S. income before income taxes was $52.9 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $36.4 billion. In fiscal year 2022, our U.S. income before income taxes was $47.8 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $35.9 billion. Uncertain Tax Positions We settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011. In February 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. We also settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in fiscal year 2016, and a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we settled an additional portion of the IRS audits for tax years 2004 to 2013 and made a payment of $1.7 billion, including tax and interest. We remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2017. 48 PART II Item 7 As of June 30, 2023, the primary unresolved issues for the IRS audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have a material impact in our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved. We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved key transfer pricing issues. We do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2022, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Adjusted gross margin, operating income, net income, and diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Current year non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of the Q2 charge, which includes employee severance expenses, impairment charges resulting from changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activities. Prior year non-GAAP financial measures exclude the net income tax benefit related to transfer of intangible properties in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. We believe these non-GAAP measures aid investors by providing additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify trends affecting our business. For comparability of reporting, management considers non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP financial results in evaluating business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures presented should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table reconciles our financial results reported in accordance with GAAP to non-GAAP financial results: (In millions, except percentages and per share amounts) 2023 2022 Percentage Change Gross margin $ 146,052 $ 135,620 8% Severance, hardware-related impairment, and lease consolidation costs 152 0 * Adjusted gross margin (non-GAAP) $ 146,204 $ 135,620 8% Operating income $ 88,523 $ 83,383 6% Severance, hardware-related impairment, and lease consolidation costs 1,171 0 * Adjusted operating income (non-GAAP) $ 89,694 $ 83,383 8% Net income $ 72,361 $ 72,738 (1)% Severance, hardware-related impairment, and lease consolidation costs 946 0 * Net income tax benefit related to transfer of intangible properties 0 (3,291 ) * Adjusted net income (non-GAAP) $ 73,307 $ 69,447 6% Diluted earnings per share $ 9.68 $ 9.65 0% Severance, hardware-related impairment, and lease consolidation costs 0.13 0 * Net income tax benefit related to transfer of intangible properties 0 (0.44 ) * Adjusted diluted earnings per share (non-GAAP) $ 9.81 $ 9.21 7% * Not meaningful. 49 PART II Item 7 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as dividends, share repurchases, debt maturities, material capital expenditures, and the transition tax related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”), for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $111.3 billion and $104.8 billion as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Equity investments were $9.9 billion and $6.9 billion as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities. Valuation In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Level 3 investments are valued using internally-developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio. A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate. Cash Flows Cash from operations decreased $1.5 billion to $87.6 billion for fiscal year 2023, mainly due to an increase in cash paid to employees and suppliers and cash used to pay income taxes, offset in part by an increase in cash received from customers. Cash used in financing decreased $14.9 billion to $43.9 billion for fiscal year 2023, mainly due to a $10.5 billion decrease in common stock repurchases and a $6.3 billion decrease in repayments of debt, offset in part by a $1.7 billion increase in dividends paid. Cash used in investing decreased $7.6 billion to $22.7 billion for fiscal year 2023, due to a $20.4 billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets, offset in part by a $8.2 billion decrease in cash from net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, and a $4.2 billion increase in additions to property and equipment. 50 PART II Item 7 Debt Proceeds We issue debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment. The proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt. Refer to Note 11 – Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. Unearned Revenue Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include Software Assurance (“SA”) and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service. Refer to Note 1 – Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. The following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of June 30, 2023: (In millions) Three Months Ending September 30, 2023 $ 19,673 December 31, 2023 15,600 March 31, 2024 10,801 June 30, 2024 4,827 Thereafter 2,912 Total $ 53,813 If our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction-based products and services, the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption, as applicable. Refer to Note 13 – Unearned Revenue of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. Material Cash Requirements and Other Obligations Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the payments due by fiscal year for our outstanding contractual obligations as of June 30, 2023: (In millions) 2024 Thereafter Total Long-term debt: (a) Principal payments $ 5,250 $ 47,616 $ 52,866 Interest payments 1,379 19,746 21,125 Construction commitments (b) 12,237 1,218 13,455 Operating and finance leases, including imputed interest (c) 5,988 73,852 79,840 Purchase commitments (d) 64,703 3,115 67,818 Total $ 89,557 $ 145,547 $ 235,104 51 PART II Item 7 Income Taxes As a result of the TCJA, we are required to pay a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to U.S. income tax. Under the TCJA, the transition tax is payable in interest-free installments over eight years, with 8% due in each of the first five years, 15% in year six, 20% in year seven, and 25% in year eight. We have paid transition tax of $7.7 billion, which included $1.5 billion for fiscal year 2023. The remaining transition tax of $10.5 billion is payable over the next three years, with $2.7 billion payable within 12 months. In fiscal year 2023, we paid cash tax of $4.8 billion due to the mandatory capitalization for tax purposes of research and development expenditures enacted by the TCJA and effective on July 1, 2022. Share Repurchases During fiscal years 2023 and 2022, we repurchased 69 million shares and 95 million shares of our common stock for $18.4 billion and $28.0 billion, respectively, through our share repurchase programs. All repurchases were made using cash resources. As of June 30, 2023, $22.3 billion remained of our $60 billion share repurchase program. Refer to Note 16 – Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. Dividends During fiscal year 2023 and 2022, our Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends of $0.68 per share and $0.62 per share, totaling $20.2 billion and $18.6 billion, respectively. We intend to continue returning capital to shareholders in the form of dividends, subject to declaration by our Board of Directors. Refer to Note 16 – Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. Other Planned Uses of Capital On January 18, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Activision Blizzard, Inc. (“Activision Blizzard”) for $95.00 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at $68.7 billion, inclusive of Activision Blizzard’s net cash. The acquisition has been approved by Activision Blizzard’s shareholders. We continue to work toward closing the transaction subject to obtaining required regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. Microsoft and Activision Blizzard have jointly agreed to extend the merger agreement through October 18, 2023 to allow for additional time to resolve remaining regulatory concerns. We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology, as well as acquisitions that align with our business strategy. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, datacenters, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years to support growth in our cloud offerings and our investments in AI infrastructure. We have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, Microsoft Experience Centers, and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, legal and other contingencies, income taxes, and inventories. 52 PART II Item 7 Revenue Recognition Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided. Judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price (“SSP"") for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP. Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers. Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented. Impairment of Investment Securities We review debt investments quarterly for credit losses and impairment. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment indicates that the investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. We perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis. We are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine the amount of the impairment loss. Once an investment is determined to be impaired, an impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net. 53 PART II Item 7 Goodwill We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. Research and Development Costs Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to production. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products. Legal and Other Contingencies The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. 54 PART II Item 7 Income Taxes The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. Inventories Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. These reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. 55 PART II Item 7 STATEMENT OF MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report. The consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management’s estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing consolidated financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. These systems are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits. The Company engaged Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit and render an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). The Board of Directors, through its Audit Committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the Company, meets periodically with management, internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting. Deloitte & Touche LLP and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the Audit Committee. Satya Nadella Chief Executive Officer Amy E.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK RISKS We are exposed to economic risk from foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, and equity prices. We use derivatives instruments to manage these risks, however, they may still impact our consolidated financial statements. Foreign Currencies Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions, including hedges. Principal currency exposures include the Euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar. Interest Rate Securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We manage the average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global fixed-income indices. Credit Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices to facilitate portfolio diversification. Equity Securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to price risk.

We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. The recast of these prior period amounts had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income statements, or consolidated cash flows statements. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Estimates and Assumptions Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the standalone selling price (“SSP”) of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand for, our inventory; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties. In July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four years to six years . This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023. Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and equipment, net as of June 30, 2022, the effect of this change in estimate for fiscal year 2023 was an increase in operating income of $ 3.7 billion and net income of $ 3.0 billion, or $ 0.40 per both basic and diluted share. Foreign Currencies Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income. Revenue Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue Product revenue includes sales from operating systems, cross-device productivity and collaboration applications, server applications, business solution applications, desktop and server management tools, software development tools, video games, and hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories. Service and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content such as Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and Xbox; solution support; and consulting services. Service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising and LinkedIn. 63 PART II Item 8 Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. Nature of Products and Services Licenses for on-premises software provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available to the customer. Customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide customers with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Revenue from distinct on-premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. In cases where we allocate revenue to software updates, primarily because the updates are provided at no additional charge, revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the estimated life of the related device or license. Certain volume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements, include on-premises licenses combined with Software Assurance (“SA”). SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and provides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use products more efficiently. On-premises licenses are considered distinct performance obligations when sold with SA. Revenue allocated to SA is generally recognized ratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits, given that SA comprises distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time. Cloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software, are provided on either a subscription or consumption basis. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is recognized based on the customer utilization of such resources. When cloud services require a significant level of integration and interdependency with software and the individual components are not considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud services are provided. Revenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. Revenue from consulting services is recognized as services are provided. Our hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot function without the operating system. In these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to resellers or directly to end customers through retail stores and online marketplaces. Refer to Note 19 – Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information, including revenue by significant product and service offering. Significant Judgments Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided. 64 PART II Item 8 Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP. Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers. Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented. Contract Balances and Other Receivables Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. We record a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. For multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. We record a receivable related to revenue recognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we have an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those licenses. Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include SA and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the future, LinkedIn subscriptions, Office 365 subscriptions, Xbox subscriptions, Windows post-delivery support, Dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service. Refer to Note 13 – Unearned Revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes in unearned revenue during the period. Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers with financing. Examples include invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year on-premises licenses that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $ 4.5 billion and $ 3.8 billion, respectively, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. 65 PART II Item 8 Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2021 Balance, beginning of period $ 710 $ 798 $ 816 Charged to costs and other 258 157 234 Write-offs ( 252 ) ( 245 ) ( 252 ) Balance, end of period $ 716 $ 710 $ 798 Allowance for doubtful accounts included in our consolidated balance sheets: (In millions) June 30, 2023 2022 2021 Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts $ 650 $ 633 $ 751 Other long-term assets 66 77 47 Total $ 716 $ 710 $ 798 As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, other receivables related to activities to facilitate the purchase of server components were $ 9.2 billion and $ 6.1 billion, respectively, and are included in other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets. We record financing receivables when we offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products and services offerings through a financing program in a limited number of countries. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, our financing receivables, net were $ 5.3 billion and $ 4.1 billion, respectively, for short-term and long-term financing receivables, which are included in other current assets and other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. We record an allowance to cover expected losses based on troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer We recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be capitalized. Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were immaterial during the periods presented and are included in other current and long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. We apply a practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs include our internal sales organization compensation program and certain partner sales incentive programs as we have determined annual compensation is commensurate with annual sales activities. Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on PCs sold by original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”), to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online advertising space; costs incurred to support and maintain cloud-based and other online products and services, including datacenter costs and royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and the amortization of capitalized software development costs. Capitalized software development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the products. 66 PART II Item 8 Product Warranty We provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary. Research and Development Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to production. Once technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $ 904 million , $ 1.5 billion, and $ 1.5 billion in fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Stock-Based Compensation Compensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance stock units (“PSUs”), is measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the related service or performance period. The fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. We measure the fair value of PSUs using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Compensation cost for RSUs is recognized using the straight-line method and for PSUs is recognized using the accelerated method. Compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase. Employee Severance On January 18, 2023, we announced a decision to reduce our overall workforce by approximately 10,000 jobs through the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we recorded $ 800 million of employee severance expenses related to these job eliminations as part of an ongoing employee benefit plan. These employee severance expenses were incurred as part of a corporate program, and were included in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated income statements and allocated to our segments based on relative gross margin. Refer to Note 19 – Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information. Income Taxes Income tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. Certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. All deferred income taxes are classified as long-term in our consolidated balance sheets. 67 PART II Item 8 Financial Instruments Investments We consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. Debt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in fair value, excluding credit losses and impairments, are recorded in other comprehensive income. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. To determine credit losses, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments (referred to as the measurement alternative). We perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. Changes in value are recorded in other income (expense), net. Derivatives Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), net with offsetting gains and losses on the hedged items. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in other income (expense), net with the corresponding hedged item. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net. For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net. 68 PART II Item 8 Fair Value Measurements We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are: We measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis. The fair values of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. Our other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. Inventories Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use, three years ; computer equipment, two to six years ; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years ; leasehold improvements, three to 20 years ; and furniture and equipment, one to 10 years . Land is not depreciated. Leases We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. 69 PART II Item 8 ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. For certain equipment leases, such as vehicles, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. Additionally, for certain equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU assets and liabilities. Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. Intangible Assets Our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from one to 20 years . We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired. NOTE 2 — EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards. The components of basic and diluted EPS were as follows: (In millions, except earnings per share) Year Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2021 Net income available for common shareholders (A) $ 72,361 $ 72,738 $ 61,271 Weighted average outstanding shares of common stock (B) 7,446 7,496 7,547 Dilutive effect of stock-based awards 26 44 61 Common stock and common stock equivalents (C) 7,472 7,540 7,608 Earnings Per Share Basic (A/B) $ 9.72 $ 9.70 $ 8.12 Diluted (A/C) $ 9.68 $ 9.65 $ 8.05 Anti-dilutive stock-based awards excluded from the calculations of diluted EPS were immaterial during the periods presented. 70 PART II Item 8 NOTE 3 — OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET The components of other income (expense), net were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2021 Interest and dividends income $ 2,994 $ 2,094 $ 2,131 Interest expense ( 1,968 ) ( 2,063 ) ( 2,346 ) Net recognized gains on investments 260 461 1,232 Net gains (losses) on derivatives ( 456 ) ( 52 ) 17 Net gains (losses) on foreign currency remeasurements 181 ( 75 ) 54 Other, net ( 223 ) ( 32 ) 98 Total $ 788 $ 333 $ 1,186 Net Recognized Gains (Losses) on Investments Net recognized gains (losses) on debt investments were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2021 Realized gains from sales of available-for-sale securities $ 36 $ 162 $ 105 Realized losses from sales of available-for-sale securities ( 124 ) ( 138 ) ( 40 ) Impairments and allowance for credit losses ( 10 ) ( 81 ) ( 2 ) Total $ ( 98 ) $ ( 57 ) $ 63 Net recognized gains (losses) on equity investments were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2021 Net realized gains on investments sold $ 75 $ 29 $ 123 Net unrealized gains on investments still held 303 509 1,057 Impairments of investments ( 20 ) ( 20 ) ( 11 ) Total $ 358 $ 518 $ 1,169 71 PART II Item 8 NOTE 4 — INVESTMENTS Investment Components The components of investments were as follows: (In millions) Fair Value Level Adjusted Cost Basis Unrealized Gains Unrealized Losses Recorded Basis Cash and Cash Equivalents Short-term Investments Equity Investments June 30, 2023 Changes in Fair Value Recorded in Other Comprehensive Income Commercial paper Level 2 $ 16,589 $ 0 $ 0 $ 16,589 $ 12,231 $ 4,358 $ 0 Certificates of deposit Level 2 2,701 0 0 2,701 2,657 44 0 U.S. government securities Level 1 65,237 2 ( 3,870 ) 61,369 2,991 58,378 0 U.S. agency securities Level 2 2,703 0 0 2,703 894 1,809 0 Foreign government bonds Level 2 498 1 ( 24 ) 475 0 475 0 Mortgage- and asset-backed securities Level 2 824 1 ( 39 ) 786 0 786 0 Corporate notes and bonds Level 2 10,809 8 ( 583 ) 10,234 0 10,234 0 Corporate notes and bonds Level 3 120 0 0 120 0 120 0 Municipal securities Level 2 285 1 ( 18 ) 268 7 261 0 Municipal securities Level 3 103 0 ( 16 ) 87 0 87 0 Total debt investments $ 99,869 $ 13 $ ( 4,550 ) $ 95,332 $ 18,780 $ 76,552 $ 0 Changes in Fair Value Recorded in Net Income Equity investments Level 1 $ 10,138 $ 7,446 $ 0 $ 2,692 Equity investments Other 7,187 0 0 7,187 Total equity investments $ 17,325 $ 7,446 $ 0 $ 9,879 Cash $ 8,478 $ 8,478 $ 0 $ 0 Derivatives, net (a) 6 0 6 0 Total $ 121,141 $ 34,704 $ 76,558 $ 9,879 72 PART II Item 8 (In millions) Fair Value Level Adjusted Cost Basis Unrealized Gains Unrealized Losses Recorded Basis Cash and Cash Equivalents Short-term Investments Equity Investments June 30, 2022 Changes in Fair Value Recorded in Other Comprehensive Income Commercial paper Level 2 $ 2,500 $ 0 $ 0 $ 2,500 $ 2,498 $ 2 $ 0 Certificates of deposit Level 2 2,071 0 0 2,071 2,032 39 0 U.S. government securities Level 1 79,696 29 ( 2,178 ) 77,547 9 77,538 0 U.S. agency securities Level 2 419 0 ( 9 ) 410 0 410 0 Foreign government bonds Level 2 506 0 ( 24 ) 482 0 482 0 Mortgage- and asset-backed securities Level 2 727 1 ( 30 ) 698 0 698 0 Corporate notes and bonds Level 2 11,661 4 ( 554 ) 11,111 0 11,111 0 Corporate notes and bonds Level 3 67 0 0 67 0 67 0 Municipal securities Level 2 368 19 ( 13 ) 374 0 374 0 Municipal securities Level 3 103 0 ( 6 ) 97 0 97 0 Total debt investments $ 98,118 $ 53 $ ( 2,814 ) $ 95,357 $ 4,539 $ 90,818 $ 0 Changes in Fair Value Recorded in Net Income Equity investments Level 1 $ 1,590 $ 1,134 $ 0 $ 456 Equity investments Other 6,435 0 0 6,435 Total equity investments $ 8,025 $ 1,134 $ 0 $ 6,891 Cash $ 8,258 $ 8,258 $ 0 $ 0 Derivatives, net (a) 8 0 8 0 Total $ 111,648 $ 13,931 $ 90,826 $ 6,891 Equity investments presented as “Other” in the tables above include investments without readily determinable fair values measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments, and investments measured at fair value using net asset value as a practical expedient which are not categorized in the fair value hierarchy.

Our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. Our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Foreign Currencies Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. Foreign currency risks related to certain non-U.S. dollar-denominated investments are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair value hedging instruments. Foreign currency risks related to certain Euro-denominated debt are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. Certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign exchange rates on certain balance sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures. Interest Rate Interest rate risks related to certain fixed-rate debt are hedged using interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedging instruments to effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates. Securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We manage the average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using option, futures, and swap contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in “Other contracts” in the tables below. Equity Securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to market price risk. At times, we may hold options, futures, and swap contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments. Credit Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We use credit default swap contracts to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in “Other contracts” in the tables below. Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features Certain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum liquidity of $ 1.0 billion. To the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to the standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. As of June 30, 2023, our long-term unsecured debt rating was AAA , and cash investments were in excess of $ 1.0 billion. As a result, no collateral was required to be posted. 75 PART II Item 8 The following table presents the notional amounts of our outstanding derivative instruments measured in U.S. dollar equivalents: (In millions) June 30, 2023 June 30, 2022 Designated as Hedging Instruments Foreign exchange contracts purchased $ 1,492 $ 635 Interest rate contracts purchased 1,078 1,139 Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Foreign exchange contracts purchased 7,874 10,322 Foreign exchange contracts sold 25,159 21,606 Equity contracts purchased 3,867 1,131 Equity contracts sold 2,154 0 Other contracts purchased 1,224 1,642 Other contracts sold 581 544 Fair Values of Derivative Instruments The following table presents our derivative instruments: (In millions) Derivative Assets Derivative Liabilities Derivative Assets Derivative Liabilities June 30, 2023 June 30, 2022 Designated as Hedging Instruments Foreign exchange contracts $ 34 $ ( 67 ) $ 0 $ ( 77 ) Interest rate contracts 16 0 3 0 Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Foreign exchange contracts 249 ( 332 ) 333 ( 362 ) Equity contracts 165 ( 400 ) 5 ( 95 ) Other contracts 5 ( 6 ) 15 ( 17 ) Gross amounts of derivatives 469 ( 805 ) 356 ( 551 ) Gross amounts of derivatives offset in the balance sheet ( 202 ) 206 ( 130 ) 133 Cash collateral received 0 ( 125 ) 0 ( 75 ) Net amounts of derivatives $ 267 $ ( 724 ) $ 226 $ ( 493 ) Reported as Short-term investments $ 6 $ 0 $ 8 $ 0 Other current assets 245 0 218 0 Other long-term assets 16 0 0 0 Other current liabilities 0 ( 341 ) 0 ( 298 ) Other long-term liabilities 0 ( 383 ) 0 ( 195 ) Total $ 267 $ ( 724 ) $ 226 $ ( 493 ) Gross derivative assets and liabilities subject to legally enforceable master netting agreements for which we have elected to offset were $ 442 million and $ 804 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2023, and $ 343 million and $ 550 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2022.

Any change in the goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency translations and purchase accounting adjustments are presented as “Other” in the table above. Also included in “Other” are business dispositions and transfers between segments due to reorganizations, as applicable. Goodwill Impairment We test goodwill for impairment annually on May 1 at the reporting unit level, primarily using a discounted cash flow methodology with a peer-based, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. We believe use of a discounted cash flow approach is the most reliable indicator of the fair values of the businesses. No instances of impairment were identified in our May 1, 2023, May 1, 2022, or May 1, 2021 tests. As of June 30, 2023 and 2022, accumulated goodwill impairment was $ 11.3 billion.

Cash paid for interest on our debt for fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $ 1.7 billion, $ 1.9 billion, and $ 2.0 billion, respectively. 81 PART II Item 8 The following table outlines maturities of our long-term debt, including the current portion, as of June 30, 2023: (In millions) Year Ending June 30, 2024 $ 5,250 2025 2,250 2026 3,000 2027 8,000 2028 0 Thereafter 34,366 Total $ 52,866 NOTE 12 — INCOME TAXES Provision for Income Taxes The components of the provision for income taxes were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2021 Current Taxes U.S. federal $ 14,009 $ 8,329 $ 3,285 U.S. state and local 2,322 1,679 1,229 Foreign 6,678 6,672 5,467 Current taxes $ 23,009 $ 16,680 $ 9,981 Deferred Taxes U.S. federal $ ( 6,146 ) $ ( 4,815 ) $ 25 U.S. state and local ( 477 ) ( 1,062 ) ( 204 ) Foreign 564 175 29 Deferred taxes $ ( 6,059 ) $ ( 5,702 ) $ ( 150 ) Provision for income taxes $ 16,950 $ 10,978 $ 9,831 82 PART II Item 8 U.S. and foreign components of income before income taxes were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2021 U.S. $ 52,917 $ 47,837 $ 34,972 Foreign 36,394 35,879 36,130 Income before income taxes $ 89,311 $ 83,716 $ 71,102 Effective Tax Rate The items accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the U.S. federal statutory rate and our effective rate were as follows: Year Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2021 Federal statutory rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 % Effect of: Foreign earnings taxed at lower rates ( 1.8 )% ( 1.3 )% ( 2.7 )% Impact of intangible property transfers 0 % ( 3.9 )% 0 % Foreign-derived intangible income deduction ( 1.3 )% ( 1.1 )% ( 1.3 )% State income taxes, net of federal benefit 1.6 % 1.4 % 1.4 % Research and development credit ( 1.1 )% ( 0.9 )% ( 0.9 )% Excess tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation ( 0.7 )% ( 1.9 )% ( 2.4 )% Interest, net 0.8 % 0.5 % 0.5 % Other reconciling items, net 0.5 % ( 0.7 )% ( 1.8 )% Effective rate 19.0 % 13.1 % 13.8 % In the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we transferred certain intangible properties from our Puerto Rico subsidiary to the U.S. The transfer of intangible properties resulted in a $ 3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, as the value of future U.S. tax deductions exceeded the current tax liability from the U.S. global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) tax. We have historically paid India withholding taxes on software sales through distributor withholding and tax audit assessments in India. In March 2021, the India Supreme Court ruled favorably in the case of Engineering Analysis Centre of Excellence Private Limited vs The Commissioner of Income Tax for companies in 86 separate appeals, some dating back to 2012, holding that software sales are not subject to India withholding taxes. Although we were not a party to the appeals, our software sales in India were determined to be not subject to withholding taxes. Therefore, we recorded a net income tax benefit of $ 620 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 to reflect the results of the India Supreme Court decision impacting fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2016 . The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2023 is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland. The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2022 is primarily due to the net income tax benefit related to the transfer of intangible properties, earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland, and tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2021 is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland and Puerto Rico, tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation, and tax benefits from the India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes. In fiscal year 2023, our foreign regional operating center in Ireland, which is taxed at a rate lower than the U.S. rate, generated 81 % of our foreign income before tax. In fiscal years 2022 and 2021 , our foreign regional operating centers in Ireland and Puerto Rico, which are taxed at rates lower than the U.S. rate, generated 71 % and 82 % of our foreign income before tax. Other reconciling items, net consists primarily of tax credits and GILTI tax, and in fiscal year 2021, includes tax benefits from the India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes. In fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, there were no individually significant other reconciling items. 83 PART II Item 8 The increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 2022 was primarily due to a $ 3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer of intangible properties and a decrease in tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to a $ 3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer of intangible properties, offset in part by changes in the mix of our income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries, as well as tax benefits in the prior year from the India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes, an agreement between the U.S. and India tax authorities related to transfer pricing, and final Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) regulations. The components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows: (In millions) June 30, 2023 2022 Deferred Income Tax Assets Stock-based compensation expense $ 681 $ 601 Accruals, reserves, and other expenses 3,131 2,874 Loss and credit carryforwards 1,441 1,546 Amortization (a) 9,440 10,183 Leasing liabilities 5,041 4,557 Unearned revenue 3,296 2,876 Book/tax basis differences in investments and debt 373 0 Capitalized research and development (a) 6,958 473 Other 489 461 Deferred income tax assets 30,850 23,571 Less valuation allowance ( 939 ) ( 1,012 ) Deferred income tax assets, net of valuation allowance $ 29,911 $ 22,559 Deferred Income Tax Liabilities Book/tax basis differences in investments and debt $ 0 $ ( 174 ) Leasing assets ( 4,680 ) ( 4,291 ) Depreciation ( 2,674 ) ( 1,602 ) Deferred tax on foreign earnings ( 2,738 ) ( 3,104 ) Other ( 89 ) ( 103 ) Deferred income tax liabilities $ ( 10,181 ) $ ( 9,274 ) Net deferred income tax assets $ 19,730 $ 13,285 Reported As Other long-term assets $ 20,163 $ 13,515 Long-term deferred income tax liabilities ( 433 ) ( 230 ) Net deferred income tax assets $ 19,730 $ 13,285 Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are paid or recovered. As of June 30, 2023, we had federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 509 million, $ 1.2 billion, and $ 2.3 billion, respectively. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards have varying expiration dates ranging from fiscal year 2024 to 2043 or indefinite carryforward periods , if not utilized. The majority of our foreign net operating loss carryforwards do not expire. Certain acquired net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation but are expected to be realized with the exception of those which have a valuation allowance. As of June 30, 2023, we had $ 456 million federal capital loss carryforwards for U.S. tax purposes from our acquisition of Nuance. The federal capital loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation and will expire in fiscal year 2025 . 84 PART II Item 8 The valuation allowance disclosed in the table above relates to the foreign net operating loss carryforwards, federal capital loss carryforwards, and other net deferred tax assets that may not be realized. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, were $ 23.1 billion, $ 16.0 billion, and $ 13.4 billion in fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Uncertain Tax Positions Gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions as of June 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, were $ 17.1 billion, $ 15.6 billion, and $ 14.6 billion, respectively, which were primarily included in long-term income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets. If recognized, the resulting tax benefit would affect our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021 by $ 14.4 billion, $ 13.3 billion, and $ 12.5 billion, respectively. As of June 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, we had accrued interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $ 5.2 billion, $ 4.3 billion, and $ 4.3 billion, respectively, net of income tax benefits. The provision for income taxes for fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021 included interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $ 918 million, $ 36 million, and $ 274 million, respectively, net of income tax benefits. The aggregate changes in the gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2021 Beginning unrecognized tax benefits $ 15,593 $ 14,550 $ 13,792 Decreases related to settlements ( 329 ) ( 317 ) ( 195 ) Increases for tax positions related to the current year 1,051 1,145 790 Increases for tax positions related to prior years 870 461 461 Decreases for tax positions related to prior years ( 60 ) ( 246 ) ( 297 ) Decreases due to lapsed statutes of limitations ( 5 ) 0 ( 1 ) Ending unrecognized tax benefits $ 17,120 $ 15,593 $ 14,550 We settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011. In February 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. We also settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in fiscal year 2016, and a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we settled an additional portion of the IRS audits for tax years 2004 to 2013 and made a payment of $ 1.7 billion, including tax and interest. We remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2017 . As of June 30, 2023, the primary unresolved issues for the IRS audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have a material impact in our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved. We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved key transfer pricing issues. We do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2022 , some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. 85 PART II Item 8 NOTE 13 — UNEARNED REVENUE Unearned revenue by segment was as follows: (In millions) June 30, 2023 2022 Productivity and Business Processes $ 27,572 $ 24,558 Intelligent Cloud 21,563 19,371 More Personal Computing 4,678 4,479 Total $ 53,813 $ 48,408 Changes in unearned revenue were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2023 Balance, beginning of period $ 48,408 Deferral of revenue 123,935 Recognition of unearned revenue ( 118,530 ) Balance, end of period $ 53,813 Revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations, which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods, was $ 229 billion as of June 30, 2023, of which $ 224 billion is related to the commercial portion of revenue. We expect to recognize approximately 45 % of this revenue over the next 12 months and the remainder thereafter. NOTE 14 — LEASES We have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, Microsoft Experience Centers, and certain equipment. Our leases have remaining lease terms of less than 1 year to 18 years, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to 5 years, and some of which include options to terminate the leases within 1 year. The components of lease expense were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2021 Operating lease cost $ 2,875 $ 2,461 $ 2,127 Finance lease cost: Amortization of right-of-use assets $ 1,352 $ 980 $ 921 Interest on lease liabilities 501 429 386 Total finance lease cost $ 1,853 $ 1,409 $ 1,307 Supplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2021 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities: Operating cash flows from operating leases $ 2,706 $ 2,368 $ 2,052 Operating cash flows from finance leases 501 429 386 Financing cash flows from finance leases 1,056 896 648 Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations: Operating leases 3,514 5,268 4,380 Finance leases 3,128 4,234 3,290 86 PART II Item 8 Supplemental balance sheet information related to leases was as follows: (In millions, except lease term and discount rate) June 30, 2023 2022 Operating Leases Operating lease right-of-use assets $ 14,346 $ 13,148 Other current liabilities $ 2,409 $ 2,228 Operating lease liabilities 12,728 11,489 Total operating lease liabilities $ 15,137 $ 13,717 Finance Leases Property and equipment, at cost $ 20,538 $ 17,388 Accumulated depreciation ( 4,647 ) ( 3,285 ) Property and equipment, net $ 15,891 $ 14,103 Other current liabilities $ 1,197 $ 1,060 Other long-term liabilities 15,870 13,842 Total finance lease liabilities $ 17,067 $ 14,902 Weighted Average Remaining Lease Term Operating leases 8 years 8 years Finance leases 11 years 12 years Weighted Average Discount Rate Operating leases 2.9 % 2.1 % Finance leases 3.4 % 3.1 % The following table outlines maturities of our lease liabilities as of June 30, 2023: (In millions) Year Ending June 30, Operating Leases Finance Leases 2024 $ 2,784 $ 1,747 2025 2,508 2,087 2026 2,142 1,771 2027 1,757 1,780 2028 1,582 1,787 Thereafter 6,327 11,462 Total lease payments 17,100 20,634 Less imputed interest ( 1,963 ) ( 3,567 ) Total $ 15,137 $ 17,067 As of June 30, 2023, we have additional operating and finance leases, primarily for datacenters, that have not yet commenced of $ 7.7 billion and $ 34.4 billion, respectively. These operating and finance leases will commence between fiscal year 2024 and fiscal year 2030 with lease terms of 1 year to 18 years. 87 PART II Item 8 NOTE 15 — CONTINGENCIES U.S. Cell Phone Litigation Microsoft Mobile Oy, a subsidiary of Microsoft, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in 46 lawsuits, including 45 lawsuits filed in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and other adverse health effects. We assumed responsibility for these claims in our agreement to acquire Nokia’s Devices and Services business and have been substituted for the Nokia defendants. Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the U.S. Federal Communications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines (“FCC Guidelines”) are pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines. In 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plaintiffs’ expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed scientific methodologies. In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motion to exclude the plaintiffs’ general causation experts. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence. In October 2016, the Court of Appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases to the trial court for further proceedings under that standard. The plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which were stricken by the court. A hearing on general causation took place in September of 2022. In April of 2023, the court granted defendants’ motion to strike the testimony of plaintiffs’ experts that cell phones cause brain cancer and entered an order excluding all of plaintiffs’ experts from testifying. Irish Data Protection Commission Matter In 2018, the Irish Data Protection Commission (“IDPC”) began investigating a complaint against LinkedIn as to whether LinkedIn’s targeted advertising practices violated the recently implemented European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). Microsoft cooperated throughout the period of inquiry. In April 2023, the IDPC provided LinkedIn with a non-public preliminary draft decision alleging GDPR violations and proposing a fine. Microsoft intends to challenge the preliminary draft decision. There is no set timeline for the IDPC to issue a final decision. Other Contingencies We also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. As of June 30, 2023, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $ 617 million. While we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $ 600 million in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable. 88 PART II Item 8 NOTE 16 — STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY Shares Outstanding Shares of common stock outstanding were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2021 Balance, beginning of year 7,464 7,519 7,571 Issued 37 40 49 Repurchased ( 69 ) ( 95 ) ( 101 ) Balance, end of year 7,432 7,464 7,519 Share Repurchases On September 18, 2019, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $ 40.0 billion in share repurchases.

The weighted average grant-date fair value of stock awards granted was $ 252.59 , $ 291.22 , and $ 221.13 for fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The fair value of stock awards vested was $ 11.9 billion, $ 14.1 billion, and $ 13.4 billion, for fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. As of June 30, 2023, an aggregate of 164 million shares were authorized for future grant under our stock plans. Employee Stock Purchase Plan We have an ESPP for all eligible employees.

NOTE 19 — SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA In its operation of the business, management, including our chief operating decision maker, who is also our Chief Executive Officer, reviews certain financial information, including segmented internal profit and loss statements prepared on a basis not consistent with GAAP. During the periods presented, we reported our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing. We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the way we internally manage and monitor our business. Our reportable segments are described below. Productivity and Business Processes Our Productivity and Business Processes segment consists of products and services in our portfolio of productivity, communication, and information services, spanning a variety of devices and platforms. This segment primarily comprises: Intelligent Cloud Our Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, private, and hybrid server products and cloud services that can power modern business and developers. This segment primarily comprises: More Personal Computing Our More Personal Computing segment consists of products and services that put customers at the center of the experience with our technology. This segment primarily comprises: 93 PART II Item 8 Revenue and costs are generally directly attributed to our segments. However, due to the integrated structure of our business, certain revenue recognized and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. Revenue from certain contracts is allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services, which can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit margin. Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative revenue methodology. Operating expenses that are allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple segments benefit and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin. In addition, certain costs are incurred at a corporate level and allocated to our segments. These allocated costs generally include legal, including settlements and fines, information technology, human resources, finance, excise taxes, field selling, shared facilities services, customer service and support , and severance incurred as part of a corporate program. Each allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs being allocated and is generally based on relative gross margin or relative headcount. Segment revenue and operating income were as follows during the periods presented: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2021 Revenue Productivity and Business Processes $ 69,274 $ 63,364 $ 53,915 Intelligent Cloud 87,907 74,965 59,728 More Personal Computing 54,734 59,941 54,445 Total $ 211,915 $ 198,270 $ 168,088 Operating Income Productivity and Business Processes $ 34,189 $ 29,690 $ 24,351 Intelligent Cloud 37,884 33,203 26,471 More Personal Computing 16,450 20,490 19,094 Total $ 88,523 $ 83,383 $ 69,916 No sales to an individual customer or country other than the United States accounted for more than 10% of revenue for fiscal years 2023, 2022, or 2021.

These amounts are primarily included in Server products and cloud services, Office products and cloud services, LinkedIn, and Dynamics in the table above. Assets are not allocated to segments for internal reporting presentations. A portion of amortization and depreciation is included with various other costs in an overhead allocation to each segment. It is impracticable for us to separately identify the amount of amortization and depreciation by segment that is included in the measure of segment profit or loss.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated July 27, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Revenue Recognition – Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. The Company offers customers the ability to acquire multiple licenses of software products and services, including cloud-based services, in its customer agreements through its volume licensing programs. 96 PART II Item 8 Significant judgment is exercised by the Company in determining revenue recognition for these customer agreements, and includes the following: Given these factors and due to the volume of transactions, the related audit effort in evaluating management's judgments in determining revenue recognition for these customer agreements was extensive and required a high degree of auditor judgment. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our principal audit procedures related to the Company's revenue recognition for these customer agreements included the following:  We tested the effectiveness of controls related to the identification of distinct performance obligations, the determination of the timing of revenue recognition, and the estimation of variable consideration.  We evaluated management's significant accounting policies related to these customer agreements for reasonableness.  We selected a sample of customer agreements and performed the following procedures: - Obtained and read contract source documents for each selection, including master agreements, and other documents that were part of the agreement. - Tested management's identification and treatment of contract terms. - Assessed the terms in the customer agreement and evaluated the appropriateness of management's application of their accounting policies, along with their use of estimates, in the determination of revenue recognition conclusions.  We evaluated the reasonableness of management's estimate of stand-alone selling prices for products and services that are not sold separately.  We tested the mathematical accuracy of management's calculations of revenue and the associated timing of revenue recognized in the financial statements. Income Taxes – Uncertain Tax Positions – Refer to Note 12 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company's long-term income taxes liability includes uncertain tax positions related to transfer pricing issues that remain unresolved with the Internal Revenue Service (""IRS""). The Company remains under IRS audit, or subject to IRS audit, for tax years subsequent to 2003. While the Company has settled a portion of the IRS audits, resolution of the remaining matters could have a material impact on the Company's financial statements. Conclusions on recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions involve significant estimates and management judgment and include complex considerations of the Internal Revenue Code, related regulations, tax case laws, and prior-year audit settlements. Given the complexity and the subjective nature of the transfer pricing issues that remain unresolved with the IRS, evaluating management's estimates relating to their determination of uncertain tax positions required extensive audit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment, including involvement of our tax specialists. 97 PART II Item 8 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our principal audit procedures to evaluate management's estimates of uncertain tax positions related to unresolved transfer pricing issues included the following: /s/ D ELOITTE & T OUCHE LLP Seattle, Washington July 27, 2023 We have served as the Company's auditor since 1983. 98 PART II Item 9, 9A ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOU NTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE Not applicable. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective. REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL C ONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our consolidated financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected. Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2023. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Deloitte & Touche LLP has audited our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023; their report is included in Item 9A. 99 PART II Item 9A REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGIST ERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Microsoft Corporation Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries (the ""Company"") as of June 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2023, of the Company and our report dated July 27, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ D ELOITTE & T OUCHE LLP Seattle, Washington July 27, 2023 100 PART II, III Item 9B, 9C, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 ITEM 9B.

BUSINESS GENERAL Embracing Our Future Microsoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. We strive to create local opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world. Our platforms and tools help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness, and public-sector efficiency. We are creating the tools and platforms that deliver better, faster, and more effective solutions to support new startups, improve educational and health outcomes, and empower human ingenuity. Microsoft is innovating and expanding our entire portfolio to help people and organizations overcome today’s challenges and emerge stronger. We bring technology and products together into experiences and solutions that unlock value for our customers. In a dynamic environment, digital technology is the key input that powers the world’s economic output. Our ecosystem of customers and partners have learned that while hybrid work is complex, embracing flexibility, different work styles, and a culture of trust can help navigate the challenges the world faces today. Organizations of all sizes have digitized business-critical functions, redefining what they can expect from their business applications. Customers are looking to unlock value while simplifying security and management. From infrastructure and data, to business applications and collaboration, we provide unique, differentiated value to customers. We are building a distributed computing fabric – across cloud and the edge – to help every organization build, run, and manage mission-critical workloads anywhere. In the next phase of innovation, artificial intelligence (“AI”) capabilities are rapidly advancing, fueled by data and knowledge of the world. We are enabling metaverse experiences at all layers of our stack, so customers can more effectively model, automate, simulate, and predict changes within their industrial environments, feel a greater sense of presence in the new world of hybrid work, and create custom immersive worlds to enable new opportunities for connection and experimentation. What We Offer Founded in 1975, we develop and support software, services, devices, and solutions that deliver new value for customers and help people and businesses realize their full potential. We offer an array of services, including cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content, and we provide solution support and consulting services. We also deliver relevant online advertising to a global audience. 3 PART I Item 1 Our products include operating systems , cross-device productivity and collaboration applications , server applications , business solution applications , desktop and server management tools , software development tools , and video games. We also design and sell devices, including PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories. The Ambitions That Drive Us To achieve our vision, our research and development efforts focus on three interconnected ambitions: • Reinvent productivity and business processes. • Build the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge platform. • Create more personal computing. Reinvent Productivity and Business Processes At Microsoft, we provide technology and resources to help our customers create a secure hybrid work environment. Our family of products plays a key role in the ways the world works, learns, and connects. Our growth depends on securely delivering continuous innovation and advancing our leading productivity and collaboration tools and services, including Office 365, Dynamics 365, and LinkedIn. Microsoft 365 brings together Office 365, Windows, and Enterprise Mobility + Security to help organizations empower their employees with AI-backed tools that unlock creativity, increase collaboration, and fuel innovation, all the while enabling compliance coverage and data protection. Microsoft Teams is a comprehensive platform for work, with meetings, calls, chat, collaboration, and business process automation. Microsoft Viva is an employee experience platform that brings together communications, knowledge, learning, resources, and insights powered by Microsoft 365. Together with the Microsoft Cloud, Dynamics 365, Microsoft Teams, and Azure Synapse bring a new era of collaborative applications that transform every business function and process. Microsoft Power Platform is helping domain experts drive productivity gains with low-code/no-code tools, robotic process automation, virtual agents, and business intelligence. In a dynamic labor market, LinkedIn is helping professionals use the platform to connect, learn, grow, and get hired. Build the Intelligent Cloud and Intelligent Edge Platform As digital transformation accelerates, organizations in every sector across the globe can address challenges that will have a fundamental impact on their success. For enterprises, digital technology empowers employees, optimizes operations, engages customers, and in some cases, changes the very core of products and services. Microsoft has a proven track record of delivering high value to our customers across many diverse and durable growth markets. We continue to invest in high performance and sustainable computing to meet the growing demand for fast access to Microsoft services provided by our network of cloud computing infrastructure and datacenters. Azure is a trusted cloud with comprehensive compliance coverage and AI-based security built in. Our cloud business benefits from three economies of scale: datacenters that deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones; datacenters that coordinate and aggregate diverse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns, improving the utilization of computing, storage, and network resources; and multi-tenancy locations that lower application maintenance labor costs. The Microsoft Cloud is the most comprehensive and trusted cloud, providing the best integration across the technology stack while offering openness, improving time to value, reducing costs, and increasing agility. Being a global-scale cloud, Azure uniquely offers hybrid consistency, developer productivity, AI capabilities, and trusted security and compliance. We see more emerging use cases and needs for compute and security at the edge and are accelerating our innovation across the spectrum of intelligent edge devices, from Internet of Things (“IoT”) sensors to gateway devices and edge hardware to build, manage, and secure edge workloads. With Azure Stack, organizations can extend Azure into their own datacenters to create a consistent stack across the public cloud and the intelligent edge. 4 PART I Item 1 Our hybrid infrastructure consistency spans security, compliance, identity, and management, helping to support the real-world needs and evolving regulatory requirements of commercial customers and enterprises. Our industry clouds bring together capabilities across the entire Microsoft Cloud, along with industry-specific customizations, to improve time to value, increase agility, and lower costs. Azure Arc simplifies governance and management by delivering a consistent multi-cloud and on-premises management platform. Security, compliance, identity, and management underlie our entire tech stack. We offer integrated, end-to-end capabilities to protect people and organizations. In March 2022, we completed our acquisition of Nuance Communications, Inc. (“Nuance”). Together, Microsoft and Nuance will enable organizations across industries to accelerate their business goals with security-focused, cloud-based solutions infused with powerful, vertically optimized AI. We are accelerating our development of mixed reality solutions with new Azure services and devices. Microsoft Mesh enables presence and shared experiences from anywhere through mixed reality applications. The opportunity to merge the physical and digital worlds, when combined with the power of Azure cloud services, unlocks new workloads and experiences to create common understanding and drive more informed decisions. The ability to convert data into AI drives our competitive advantage. Azure SQL Database makes it possible for customers to take SQL Server from their on-premises datacenter to a fully managed instance in the cloud to utilize built-in AI. Azure Synapse brings together data integration, enterprise data warehousing, and big data analytics in a comprehensive solution. We are accelerating adoption of AI innovations from research to products. Our innovation helps every developer be an AI developer, with approachable new tools from Azure Machine Learning Studio for creating simple machine learning models, to the powerful Azure Machine Learning Workbench for the most advanced AI modeling and data science. From GitHub to Visual Studio, we provide a developer tool chain for everyone, no matter the technical experience, across all platforms, whether Azure, Windows, or any other cloud or client platform. Additionally, we are extending our infrastructure beyond the planet, bringing cloud computing to space. Azure Orbital is a fully managed ground station as a service for fast downlinking of data. Create More Personal Computing We strive to make computing more personal by putting people at the core of the experience, enabling them to interact with technology in more intuitive, engaging, and dynamic ways. Microsoft 365 is empowering people and organizations to be productive and secure as they adapt to more fluid ways of working, learning, and playing. Windows also plays a critical role in fueling our cloud business with Windows 365, a desktop operating system that’s also a cloud service. From another internet-connected device, including Android or macOS devices, you can run Windows 365, just like a virtual machine. With Windows 11, we have simplified the design and experience to empower productivity and inspire creativity. Windows 11 offers innovations focused on enhancing productivity and is designed to support hybrid work. It adds new experiences that include powerful task switching tools like new snap layouts, snap groups, and desktops; new ways to stay connected through Microsoft Teams chat; the information you want at your fingertips; and more. Windows 11 security and privacy features include operating system security, application security, and user and identity security. Tools like search, news, and maps have given us immediate access to the world’s information. Today, through our Search, News, Mapping, and Browse services, Microsoft delivers unique trust, privacy, and safety features. Microsoft Edge is our fast and secure browser that helps protect your data, with built-in shopping tools designed to save you time and money. Organizational tools such as Collections, Vertical Tabs, and Immersive Reader help make the most of your time while browsing, streaming, searching, and sharing. We are committed to designing and marketing first-party devices to help drive innovation, create new device categories, and stimulate demand in the Windows ecosystem. The Surface family includes Surface Laptop Studio, Surface Laptop 4, Surface Laptop Go 2, Surface Laptop Pro 8, Surface Pro X, Surface Go 3, Surface Studio 2, and Surface Duo 2. 5 PART I Item 1 With three billion people actively playing games today, and a new generation steeped in interactive entertainment, Microsoft continues to invest in content, community, and cloud services . We have broadened our approach to how we think about gaming end-to-end, from the way games are created and distributed to how they are played , including cloud gaming so players can stream across PC, console, and mobile. We have a strong position with our large and growing highly engaged community of gamers , including the acquisition of ZeniMax Media Inc., the parent company of Bethesda Softworks LLC . In January 2022, we announced plans to acquire Activision Blizzard , Inc., a leader in game development and an interactive entertainment content publisher . Xbox Game Pass is a community with access to a curated library of over 100 first- and third-party console and PC titles . Xbox Cloud Gaming is Microsoft’s game streaming technology that is complementary to our console hardware and gives fans the ultimate choice to play the games they want, with the people they want, on the devices they want. Our Future Opportunity The case for digital transformation has never been more urgent. Customers are looking to us to help improve productivity and the affordability of their products and services. We continue to develop complete, intelligent solutions for our customers that empower people to stay productive and collaborate, while safeguarding businesses and simplifying IT management. Our goal is to lead the industry in several distinct areas of technology over the long term, which we expect will translate to sustained growth. We are investing significant resources in: • Transforming the workplace to deliver new modern, modular business applications, drive deeper insights, and improve how people communicate, collaborate, learn, work, play, and interact with one another. • Building and running cloud-based services in ways that unleash new experiences and opportunities for businesses and individuals. • Applying AI to drive insights and act on our customer’s behalf by understanding and interpreting their needs using natural methods of communication. • Tackling security from all angles with our integrated, end-to-end solutions spanning security, compliance, identity, and management, across all clouds and platforms. • Inventing new gaming experiences that bring people together around their shared love for games on any devices and pushing the boundaries of innovation with console and PC gaming by creating the next wave of entertainment. • Using Windows to fuel our cloud business, grow our share of the PC market, and drive increased engagement with our services like Microsoft 365 Consumer, Teams, Edge, Bing, Xbox Game Pass, and more. Our future growth depends on our ability to transcend current product category definitions, business models, and sales motions. We have the opportunity to redefine what customers and partners can expect and are working to deliver new solutions that reflect the best of Microsoft. Corporate Social Responsibility Commitment to Sustainability We work to ensure that technology is inclusive, trusted, and increases sustainability. We are accelerating progress toward a more sustainable future by reducing our environmental footprint, advancing research, helping our customers build sustainable solutions, and advocating for policies that benefit the environment. In January 2020, we announced a bold commitment and detailed plan to be carbon negative by 2030, and to remove from the environment by 2050 all the carbon we have emitted since our founding in 1975. This included a commitment to invest $1 billion over four years in new technologies and innovative climate solutions. We built on this pledge by adding commitments to be water positive by 2030, zero waste by 2030, and to protect ecosystems by developing a Planetary Computer. We also help our suppliers and customers around the world use Microsoft technology to reduce their own carbon footprint. Fiscal year 2021 was a year of both successes and challenges. While we continued to make progress on several of our goals, with an overall reduction in our combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, our Scope 3 emissions increased, due in substantial part to significant global datacenter expansions and growth in Xbox sales and usage as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite these Scope 3 increases, we will continue to build the foundations and do the work to deliver on our commitments, and help our customers and partners achieve theirs. We have learned the impact of our work will not all be felt immediately, and our experience highlights how progress won’t always be linear. 6 PART I Item 1 While fiscal year 2021 presented us with some new learnings, we also made some great progress. A few examples that illuminate the diversity of our work include: • We purchased the removal of 1.4 million metrics tons of carbon. • Four of our datacenters received new or renewed Zero Waste certifications. • We granted $100 million to Breakthrough Energy Catalyst to accelerate the development of climate solutions the world needs to reach net-zero across four key areas: direct air capture, green hydrogen, long duration energy storage, and sustainable aviation fuel. • We joined the First Movers Coalition as an early leader and expert partner in the carbon dioxide removal sector, with a commitment of $200 million toward carbon removal by 2030. Sustainability is an existential priority for our society and businesses today. This led us to create our Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability, an entirely new business process category to help organizations monitor their carbon footprint across their operations. We also joined with leading organizations to launch the Carbon Call – an initiative to mobilize collective action to solve carbon emissions and removal accounting challenges for a net zero future. The investments we make in sustainability carry through to our products, services, and devices. We design our devices, from Surface to Xbox, to minimize their impact on the environment. Our cloud and AI services and datacenters help businesses cut energy consumption, reduce physical footprints, and design sustainable products. Addressing Racial Injustice and Inequity We are committed to addressing racial injustice and inequity in the United States for Black and African American communities and helping improve lived experiences at Microsoft, in employees’ communities, and beyond. Our Racial Equity Initiative focuses on three multi-year pillars, each containing actions and progress we expect to make or exceed by 2025. • Strengthening our communities: using data, technology, and partnerships to help improve the lives of Black and African American people in the United States, including our employees and their communities. • Evolving our ecosystem: using our balance sheet and relationships with suppliers and partners to foster societal change and create new opportunities. • Increasing representation and strengthening inclusion: build on our momentum, adding a $150 million investment to strengthen inclusion and double the number of Black, African American, Hispanic, and Latinx leaders in the United States by 2025. Over the last year, we collaborated with partners and worked within neighborhoods and communities to launch and scale a number of projects and programs, including: working with 70 organizations in 145 communities on the Justice Reform Initiative, expanding access to affordable broadband and devices for Black and African American communities and key institutions that support them in major urban centers, expanding access to skills and education to support Black and African American students and adults to succeed in the digital economy, and increasing technology support for nonprofits that provide critical services to Black and African American communities. We have made meaningful progress on representation and inclusion at Microsoft. We are 90 percent of the way to our 2025 commitment to double the number of Black and African American people managers, senior individual contributors, and senior leaders in the U.S., and 50 percent of the way for Hispanic and Latinx people managers, senior individual contributors, and senior leaders in the U.S. We exceeded our goal on increasing the percentage of transaction volumes with Black- and African American-owned financial institutions and increased our deposits with Black- and African American-owned minority depository institutions, enabling increased funds into local communities. Additionally, we enriched our supplier pipeline, reaching more than 90 percent of our goal to spend $500 million with double the number of Black and African American-owned suppliers. We also increased the number of identified partners in the Black Partner Growth Initiative and continue to invest in the partner community through the Black Channel Partner Alliance by supporting events focused on business growth, accelerators, and mentorship. Progress does not undo the egregious injustices of the past or diminish those who continue to live with inequity. We are committed to leveraging our resources to help accelerate diversity and inclusion across our ecosystem and to hold ourselves accountable to accelerate change – for Microsoft, and beyond. 7 PART I Item 1 Investing in Digital Skills The COVID-19 pandemic led to record unemployment, disrupting livelihoods of people around the world. After helping over 30 million people in 249 countries and territories with our global skills initiative, we introduced a new initiative to support a more skills-based labor market, with greater flexibility and accessible learning paths to develop the right skills needed for the most in-demand jobs. Our skills initiative brings together learning resources, certification opportunities, and job-seeker tools from LinkedIn, GitHub, and Microsoft Learn, and is built on data insights drawn from LinkedIn’s Economic Graph. We previously invested $20 million in key non-profit partnerships through Microsoft Philanthropies to help people from underserved communities that are often excluded by the digital economy. We also launched a national campaign with U.S. community colleges to help skill and recruit into the cybersecurity workforce 250,000 people by 2025, representing half of the country’s workforce shortage. To that end, we are making curriculum available free of charge to all of the nation’s public community colleges, providing training for new and existing faculty at 150 community colleges, and providing scholarships and supplemental resources to 25,000 students. HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview Microsoft aims to recruit, develop, and retain world-changing talent from a diversity of backgrounds. To foster their and our success, we seek to create an environment where people can thrive, where they can do their best work, where they can proudly be their authentic selves, guided by our values, and where they know their needs can be met. We strive to maximize the potential of our human capital resources by creating a respectful, rewarding, and inclusive work environment that enables our global employees to create products and services that further our mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. As of June 30, 2022, we employed approximately 221,000 people on a full-time basis, 122,000 in the U.S. and 99,000 internationally. Of the total employed people, 85,000 were in operations, including manufacturing, distribution, product support, and consulting services; 73,000 were in product research and development; 47,000 were in sales and marketing; and 16,000 were in general and administration. Certain employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Our Culture Microsoft’s culture is grounded in the growth mindset. This means everyone is on a continuous journey to learn and grow. We believe potential can be nurtured and is not pre-determined, and we should always be learning and curious – trying new things without fear of failure. We identified four attributes that allow growth mindset to flourish: • Obsessing over what matters to our customers. • Becoming more diverse and inclusive in everything we do. • Operating as one company, One Microsoft, instead of multiple siloed businesses. • Making a difference in the lives of each other, our customers, and the world around us. Our employee listening systems enable us to gather feedback directly from our workforce to inform our programs and employee needs globally. Seventy percent of employees globally participated in our fiscal year 2022 Employee Signals survey, which covers a variety of topics such as thriving, inclusion, team culture, wellbeing, and learning and development. Throughout the fiscal year, we collect over 75,000 Daily Pulse employee survey responses. During fiscal year 2022, our Daily Pulse surveys gave us invaluable insights into ways we could support employees through the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing racial injustice, the war in Ukraine, and their general wellbeing. In addition to Employee Signals and Daily Pulse surveys, we gain insights through onboarding, internal mobility, leadership, performance and development, exit surveys, internal Yammer channels, employee Q&A sessions, and AskHR Service support. 8 PART I Item 1 Diversity and Inclusion At Microsoft we have an inherently inclusive mission: to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. We think of diversity and inclusion as core to our business model, informing our actions to impact economies and people around the world. There are billions of people who want to achieve more, but have a different set of circumstances, abilities, and backgrounds that often limit access to opportunity and achievement. The better we represent that diversity inside Microsoft, the more effectively we can innovate for those we seek to empower. We strive to include others by holding ourselves accountable for diversity, driving global systemic change in our workplace and workforce, and creating an inclusive work environment. Through this commitment we can allow everyone the chance to be their authentic selves and do their best work every day. We support multiple highly active Employee Resource Groups for women, families, racial and ethnic minorities, military, people with disabilities, and employees who identify as LGBTQIA+, where employees can go for support, networking, and community-building. As described in our 2021 Proxy Statement , annual performance and compensation reviews of our senior leadership team include an evaluation of their contributions to employee culture and diversity. To ensure accountability over time, we publicly disclose our progress on a multitude of workforce metrics including: • Detailed breakdowns of gender, racial, and ethnic minority representation in our employee population, with data by job types, levels, and segments of our business. • Our EEO-1 report (equal employment opportunity). • Disability representation. • Pay equity (see details below). Total Rewards We develop dynamic, sustainable, market-driven, and strategic programs with the goal of providing a highly differentiated portfolio to attract, reward, and retain top talent and enable our employees to thrive. These programs reinforce our culture and values such as collaboration and growth mindset. Managers evaluate and recommend rewards based on, for example, how well we leverage the work of others and contribute to the success of our colleagues. We monitor pay equity and career progress across multiple dimensions. As part of our effort to promote a One Microsoft and inclusive culture, in fiscal year 2021 we expanded stock eligibility to all Microsoft employees as part of our annual rewards process. This includes all non-exempt and exempt employees and equivalents across the globe including business support professionals and datacenter and retail employees. In response to the Great Reshuffle, in fiscal year 2022 we announced a sizable investment in annual merit and annual stock award opportunity for all employees below senior executive levels. We also invested in base salary adjustments for our datacenter and retail hourly employees and hourly equivalents outside the U.S. These investments have supported retention and help to ensure that Microsoft remains an employer of choice. Pay Equity In our 2021 Diversity and Inclusion Report, we reported that all racial and ethnic minority employees in the U.S. combined earn $1.006 for every $1.000 earned by their white counterparts, that women in the U.S. earn $1.002 for every $1.000 earned by their counterparts in the U.S. who are men, and women in the U.S. plus our twelve other largest employee geographies representing 86.6% of our global population (Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Romania, Singapore, and the United Kingdom) combined earn $1.001 for every $1.000 by men in these countries. Our intended result is a global performance and development approach that fosters our culture, and competitive compensation that ensures equitable pay by role while supporting pay for performance. Wellness and Safety Microsoft is committed to supporting our employees’ well-being and safety while they are at work and in their personal lives. We took a wide variety of measures to protect the health and well-being of our employees, suppliers, and customers during the COVID-19 pandemic and are now supporting employees in shifting to return to office and/or hybrid arrangements. We developed hybrid guidelines for managers and employees to support the transition and continue to identify ways we can support hybrid work scenarios through our employee listening systems. 9 PART I Item 1 We have invested significantly in holistic wellbeing, and offer a differentiated benefits package which includes many physical, emotional, and financial wellness programs including counseling through the Microsoft CARES Employee Assistance Program, mental wellbeing support, flexible fitness benefits, savings and investment tools, adoption assistance, and back-up care for children and elders. Finally, our Occupational Health and Safety program helps ensure employees can stay safe while they are working. We continue to strive to support our Ukrainian employees and their dependents during the Ukraine crisis with emergency relocation assistance, emergency leave, and other benefits. Learning and Development Our growth mindset culture begins with valuing learning over knowing – seeking out new ideas, driving innovation, embracing challenges, learning from failure, and improving over time. To support this culture, we offer a wide range of learning and development opportunities. We believe learning can be more than formal instruction, and our learning philosophy focuses on providing the right learning, at the right time, in the right way. Opportunities include: • Personalized, integrated, and relevant views of all learning opportunities on both our internal learning portal Learning (Viva Learning + LinkedIn Learning) and our external learning portal MS Learn are available to all employees worldwide. • In-the-classroom learning, learning cohorts, our early-in-career Aspire program, and manager excellence communities. • Required learning for all employees and managers on topics such as compliance, regulation, company culture, leadership, and management. This includes the annual Standards of Business Conduct training. • On-the-job “stretch” and advancement opportunities. • Managers holding conversations about employees’ career and development plans, coaching on career opportunities, and programs like mentoring and sponsorship. • Customized manager learning to build people manager capabilities and similar learning solutions to build leadership skills for all employees including differentiated leadership development programs. • New employee orientation covering a range of topics including company values, and culture, as well as ongoing onboarding programs. • New tools to assist managers and employees in learning how to operate, be productive, and connect in the new flexible hybrid world of work. These include quick guides for teams to use, such as Creating Team Agreements, Reconnecting as a Team, and Running Effective Hybrid Meetings. Our employees embrace the growth mindset and take advantage of the formal learning opportunities as well as thousands of informal and on-the-job learning opportunities. In terms of formal on-line learning solutions, in fiscal year 2022 our employees completed over 4.7 million courses, averaging over 14 hours per employee. Given our focus on understanding core company beliefs and compliance topics, all employees complete required learning programs like Standards of Business Conduct, Privacy, Unconscious Bias, and preventing harassment courses. Our corporate learning portal has over 100,000 average monthly active users. We have over 27,000 people managers, all of whom must complete between 20-33 hours of required manager capability and excellence training and are assigned ongoing required training each year. In addition, all employees complete skills training based on the profession they are in each year. New Ways of Working The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated our capabilities and culture with respect to flexible work. We introduced a Hybrid Workplace Flexibility Guide to better support managers and employees as they adapt to new ways of working that shift paradigms, embrace flexibility, promote inclusion, and drive innovation. Our ongoing survey data shows employees value the flexibility related to work location, work site, and work hours, and while many have begun returning to worksites as conditions have permitted, they also continue to adjust hours and/or spend some of workweeks working at home, another site, or remotely. We are focused on building capabilities to support a variety of workstyles where individuals, teams, and our business can deliver success. 10 PART I Item 1 OPERATING SEGMENTS We operate our business and report our financial performance using three segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing. Our segments provide management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. The segments enable the alignment of strategies and objectives across the development, sales, marketing, and services organizations, and they provide a framework for timely and rational allocation of resources within businesses. Additional information on our operating segments and geographic and product information is contained in Note 19 – Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).

Our vision is to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce through the ongoing development of the world’s first Economic Graph, a digital representation of the global economy. In addition to LinkedIn’s free services, LinkedIn offers monetized solutions: Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, Premium Subscriptions, and Sales Solutions. Talent Solutions provide insights for workforce planning and tools to hire, nurture, and develop talent. Talent Solutions also includes Learning Solutions, which help businesses close critical skills gaps in times where companies are having to do more with existing talent. Marketing Solutions help companies reach, engage, and convert their audiences at scale. Premium Subscriptions enables professionals to manage their professional identity, grow their network, and connect with talent through additional services like premium search. Sales Solutions help companies strengthen customer relationships, empower teams with digital selling tools, and acquire new opportunities. LinkedIn has over 850 million members and has offices around the globe. Growth will depend on our ability to increase the number of LinkedIn members and our ability to continue offering services that provide value for our members and increase their engagement. LinkedIn revenue is mainly affected by demand from enterprises and professional organizations for subscriptions to Talent Solutions, Sales Solutions, and Premium Subscriptions offerings, as well as member engagement and the quality of the sponsored content delivered to those members to drive Marketing Solutions. Dynamics Dynamics provides cloud-based and on-premises business solutions for financial management, enterprise resource planning (“ERP”), customer relationship management (“CRM”), supply chain management, and other application development platforms for small and medium businesses, large organizations, and divisions of global enterprises. Dynamics revenue is driven by the number of users licensed and applications consumed, expansion of average revenue per user, and the continued shift to Dynamics 365, a unified set of cloud-based intelligent business applications, including Power Apps and Power Automate. Competition Competitors to Office include software and global application vendors, such as Apple, Cisco Systems, Meta, Google, IBM, Okta, Proofpoint, Slack, Symantec, Zoom, and numerous web-based and mobile application competitors as well as local application developers. Apple distributes versions of its pre-installed application software, such as email and calendar products, through its PCs, tablets, and phones.

Okta, Proofpoint, and Symantec provide security solutions across email security, information protection, identity, and governance. Web-based offerings competing with individual applications have also positioned themselves as alternatives to our products and services. We compete by providing powerful, flexible, secure, integrated industry-specific, and easy-to-use productivity and collaboration tools and services that create comprehensive solutions and work well with technologies our customers already have both on-premises or in the cloud. LinkedIn faces competition from online professional networks, recruiting companies, talent management companies, and larger companies that are focusing on talent management and human resource services; job boards; traditional recruiting firms; and companies that provide learning and development products and services. Marketing Solutions competes with online and offline outlets that generate revenue from advertisers and marketers, and Sales Solutions competes with online and offline outlets for companies with lead generation and customer intelligence and insights. Dynamics competes with cloud-based and on-premises business solution providers such as Oracle, Salesforce, and SAP. 12 PART I Item 1 Intelligent Cloud Our Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, private, and hybrid server products and cloud services that can power modern business and developers. This segment primarily comprises: • Server products and cloud services, including Azure and other cloud services; SQL Server, Windows Server, Visual Studio, System Center, and related Client Access Licenses (“CALs”); and Nuance and GitHub. • Enterprise Services, including Enterprise Support Services, Microsoft Consulting Services, and Nuance professional services. Server Products and Cloud Services Azure is a comprehensive set of cloud services that offer developers, IT professionals, and enterprises freedom to build, deploy, and manage applications on any platform or device. Customers can use Azure through our global network of datacenters for computing, networking, storage, mobile and web application services, AI, IoT, cognitive services, and machine learning. Azure enables customers to devote more resources to development and use of applications that benefit their organizations, rather than managing on-premises hardware and software. Azure revenue is mainly affected by infrastructure-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service consumption-based services, and per user-based services such as Enterprise Mobility + Security. Our server products are designed to make IT professionals, developers, and their systems more productive and efficient. Server software is integrated server infrastructure and middleware designed to support software applications built on the Windows Server operating system. This includes the server platform, database, business intelligence, storage, management and operations, virtualization, service-oriented architecture platform, security, and identity software. We also license standalone and software development lifecycle tools for software architects, developers, testers, and project managers. GitHub provides a collaboration platform and code hosting service for developers. Server products revenue is mainly affected by purchases through volume licensing programs, licenses sold to original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”), and retail packaged products. CALs provide access rights to certain server products, including SQL Server and Windows Server, and revenue is reported along with the associated server product. Nuance and GitHub include both cloud and on-premises offerings. Nuance provides healthcare and enterprise AI solutions. GitHub provides a collaboration platform and code hosting service for developers. Enterprise Services Enterprise Services, including Enterprise Support Services, Microsoft Consulting Services, and Nuance Professional Services, assist customers in developing, deploying, and managing Microsoft server solutions, Microsoft desktop solutions, and Nuance conversational AI and ambient intelligent solutions, along with providing training and certification to developers and IT professionals on various Microsoft products. Competition Azure faces diverse competition from companies such as Amazon, Google, IBM, Oracle, VMware, and open source offerings. Our Enterprise Mobility + Security offerings also compete with products from a range of competitors including identity vendors, security solution vendors, and numerous other security point solution vendors. Azure’s competitive advantage includes enabling a hybrid cloud, allowing deployment of existing datacenters with our public cloud into a single, cohesive infrastructure, and the ability to run at a scale that meets the needs of businesses of all sizes and complexities. We believe our cloud’s global scale, coupled with our broad portfolio of identity and security solutions, allows us to effectively solve complex cybersecurity challenges for our customers and differentiates us from the competition. Our server products face competition from a wide variety of server operating systems and applications offered by companies with a range of market approaches. Vertically integrated computer manufacturers such as Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and Oracle offer their own versions of the Unix operating system preinstalled on server hardware. Nearly all computer manufacturers offer server hardware for the Linux operating system and many contribute to Linux operating system development. The competitive position of Linux has also benefited from the large number of compatible applications now produced by many commercial and non-commercial software developers. A number of companies, such as Red Hat, supply versions of Linux. 13 PART I Item 1 We compete to provide enterprise-wide computing solutions and point solutions with numerous commercial software vendors that offer solutions and middleware technology platforms, software applications for connectivity (both Internet and intranet), security, hosting, database, and e-business servers. IBM and Oracle lead a group of companies focused on the Java Platform Enterprise Edition that competes with our enterprise-wide computing solutions. Commercial competitors for our server applications for PC-based distributed client-server environments include CA Technologies, IBM, and Oracle. Our web application platform software competes with open source software such as Apache, Linux, MySQL, and PHP. In middleware, we compete against Java vendors. Our database, business intelligence, and data warehousing solutions offerings compete with products from IBM, Oracle, SAP, Snowflake, and other companies. Our system management solutions compete with server management and server virtualization platform providers, such as BMC, CA Technologies, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and VMware. Our products for software developers compete against offerings from Adobe, IBM, Oracle, and other companies, and also against open-source projects, including Eclipse (sponsored by CA Technologies, IBM, Oracle, and SAP), PHP, and Ruby on Rails. We believe our server products provide customers with advantages in performance, total costs of ownership, and productivity by delivering superior applications, development tools, compatibility with a broad base of hardware and software applications, security, and manageability. Our Enterprise Services business competes with a wide range of companies that provide strategy and business planning, application development, and infrastructure services, including multinational consulting firms and small niche businesses focused on specific technologies. More Personal Computing Our More Personal Computing segment consists of products and services that put customers at the center of the experience with our technology. This segment primarily comprises: • Windows, including Windows OEM licensing (“Windows OEM”) and other non-volume licensing of the Windows operating system; Windows Commercial, comprising volume licensing of the Windows operating system, Windows cloud services, and other Windows commercial offerings; patent licensing; and Windows Internet of Things. • Devices, including Surface and PC accessories. • Gaming, including Xbox hardware and Xbox content and services, comprising first- and third-party content (including games and in-game content), Xbox Game Pass and other subscriptions, Xbox Cloud Gaming, third-party disc royalties, advertising, and other cloud services. • Search and news advertising. Windows The Windows operating system is designed to deliver a more personal computing experience for users by enabling consistency of experience, applications, and information across their devices. Windows OEM revenue is impacted significantly by the number of Windows operating system licenses purchased by OEMs, which they pre-install on the devices they sell. In addition to computing device market volume, Windows OEM revenue is impacted by: • The mix of computing devices based on form factor and screen size. • Differences in device market demand between developed markets and growth markets. • Attachment of Windows to devices shipped. • Customer mix between consumer, small and medium businesses, and large enterprises. • Changes in inventory levels in the OEM channel. • Pricing changes and promotions, pricing variation that occurs when the mix of devices manufactured shifts from local and regional system builders to large multinational OEMs, and different pricing of Windows versions licensed. • Constraints in the supply chain of device components. • Piracy. 14 PART I Item 1 Windows Commercial revenue, which includes volume licensing of the Windows operating system and Windows cloud services such as Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, is affected mainly by the demand from commercial customers for volume licensing and Software Assurance (“SA”), as well as advanced security offerings. Windows Commercial revenue often reflects the number of information workers in a licensed enterprise and is relatively independent of the number of PCs sold in a given year. Patent licensing includes our programs to license patents we own for use across a broad array of technology areas, including mobile devices and cloud offerings. Windows IoT extends the power of Windows and the cloud to intelligent systems by delivering specialized operating systems, tools, and services for use in embedded devices. Devices We design and sell devices, including Surface and PC accessories. Our devices are designed to enable people and organizations to connect to the people and content that matter most using Windows and integrated Microsoft products and services. Surface is designed to help organizations, students, and consumers be more productive. Growth in Devices is dependent on total PC shipments, the ability to attract new customers, our product roadmap, and expanding into new categories. Gaming Our gaming platform is designed to provide a variety of entertainment through a unique combination of content, community, and cloud. Our exclusive game content is created through Xbox Game Studios, a collection of first-party studios creating iconic and differentiated gaming experiences. We continue to invest in new gaming studios and content to expand our IP roadmap and leverage new content creators. These unique gaming experiences are the cornerstone of Xbox Game Pass, a subscription service and gaming community with access to a curated library of over 100 first- and third-party console and PC titles. The gamer remains at the heart of the Xbox ecosystem. We continue to open new opportunities for gamers to engage both on- and off-console with both the launch of Xbox Cloud Gaming, our game streaming service, and continued investment in gaming hardware. Xbox Cloud Gaming utilizes Microsoft’s Azure cloud technology to allow direct and on-demand streaming of games to PCs, consoles, and mobile devices, enabling gamers to take their favorite games with them and play on the device most convenient to them. Xbox enables people to connect and share online gaming experiences that are accessible on Xbox consoles, Windows-enabled devices, and other devices. Xbox is designed to benefit users by providing access to a network of certified applications and services and to benefit our developer and partner ecosystems by providing access to a large customer base. Xbox revenue is mainly affected by subscriptions and sales of first- and third-party content, as well as advertising. Growth of our Gaming business is determined by the overall active user base through Xbox enabled content, availability of games, providing exclusive game content that gamers seek, the computational power and reliability of the devices used to access our content and services, and the ability to create new experiences through first-party content creators. Search and News Advertising Our Search and news advertising business is designed to deliver relevant search, native, and display advertising to a global audience. We have several partnerships with other companies, including Yahoo, through which we provide and monetize search queries. Growth depends on our ability to attract new users, understand intent, and match intent with relevant content and advertiser offerings. On June 6, 2022, we acquired Xandr, Inc., a technology platform with tools to accelerate the delivery of our digital advertising solutions. Competition Windows faces competition from various software products and from alternative platforms and devices, mainly from Apple and Google. We believe Windows competes effectively by giving customers choice, value, flexibility, security, an easy-to-use interface, and compatibility with a broad range of hardware and software applications, including those that enable productivity. 15 PART I Item 1 Devices face competition from various computer, tablet, and hardware manufacturers who offer a unique combination of high-quality industrial design and innovative technologies across various price points. These manufacturers, many of which are also current or potential partners and customers, include Apple and our Windows OEMs. Xbox and our cloud gaming services face competition from various online gaming ecosystems and game streaming services, including those operated by Amazon, Apple, Meta, Google, and Tencent. We also compete with other providers of entertainment services such as video streaming platforms. Our gaming platform competes with console platforms from Nintendo and Sony, both of which have a large, established base of customers. We believe our gaming platform is effectively positioned against, and uniquely differentiated from, competitive products and services based on significant innovation in hardware architecture, user interface, developer tools, online gaming and entertainment services, and continued strong exclusive content from our own first-party game franchises as well as other digital content offerings. Our Search and news advertising business competes with Google and a wide array of websites, social platforms like Meta, and portals that provide content and online offerings to end users. OPERATIONS We have operations centers that support operations in their regions, including customer contract and order processing, credit and collections, information processing, and vendor management and logistics. The regional center in Ireland supports the European, Middle Eastern, and African region; the center in Singapore supports the Japan, India, Greater China, and Asia-Pacific region; and the centers in Fargo, North Dakota, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Puerto Rico, Redmond, Washington, and Reno, Nevada support Latin America and North America. In addition to the operations centers, we also operate datacenters throughout the Americas, Europe, Australia, and Asia, as well as in the Middle East and Africa. To serve the needs of customers around the world and to improve the quality and usability of products in international markets, we localize many of our products to reflect local languages and conventions. Localizing a product may require modifying the user interface, altering dialog boxes, and translating text. Our devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However, some of our products contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. For these components, we have limited near-term flexibility to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or is unable to meet our requirements. Extended disruptions at these suppliers and/or manufacturers could lead to a similar disruption in our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Product and Service Development, and Intellectual Property We develop most of our products and services internally through the following engineering groups. • Cloud and AI , focuses on making IT professionals, developers, and their systems more productive and efficient through development of cloud infrastructure, server, database, CRM, ERP, software development tools and services (including GitHub), AI cognitive services, and other business process applications and services for enterprises. • Experiences and Devices , focuses on instilling a unifying product ethos across our end-user experiences and devices, including Office, Windows, Teams, con sumer web experiences (including search and news advertising), and the Surface line of devices. • Security, Compliance, Identity, and Management , focuses on cloud platform and application security, identity and network access, enterprise mobility, information protection, and managed services. • Technology and Research , focuses on our AI innovations and other forward-looking research and development efforts spanning infrastructure, services, and applications. • LinkedIn , focuses on our services that transform the way customers hire, market, sell, and learn. • Gaming , focuses on developing hardware, content, and services across a large range of platforms to help grow our user base through game experiences and social interaction. 16 PART I Item 1 Internal development allows us to maintain competitive advantages that come from product differentiation and closer technical control over our products and services. It also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented. We strive to obtain information as early as possible about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software and hardware design. Before releasing new software platforms, and as we make significant modifications to existing platforms, we provide application vendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development, training, and testing. Generally, we also create product documentation internally. We protect our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways. We work actively in the U.S. and internationally to ensure the enforcement of copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other protections that apply to our software and hardware products, services, business plans, and branding. We are a leader among technology companies in pursuing patents and currently have a portfolio of over 69,000 U.S. and international patents issued and over 19,000 pending worldwide. While we employ much of our internally-developed intellectual property exclusively in our products and services, we also engage in outbound licensing of specific patented technologies that are incorporated into licensees’ products. From time to time, we enter into broader cross-license agreements with other technology companies covering entire groups of patents. We may also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products and services. At times, we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective, such as promoting industry standards, advancing interoperability, supporting societal and/or environmental efforts, or attracting and enabling our external development community. Our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products, services, and business methods, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. We believe our continuing research and product development are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products. Investing in the Future Our success is based on our ability to create new and compelling products, services, and experiences for our users, to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new geographic and product markets, and to drive broad adoption of our products and services. We invest in a range of emerging technology trends and breakthroughs that we believe offer significant opportunities to deliver value to our customers and growth for the Company. Based on our assessment of key technology trends, we maintain our long-term commitment to research and development across a wide spectrum of technologies, tools, and platforms spanning digital work and life experiences, cloud computing, AI, devices, and operating systems. While our main product research and development facilities are located in Redmond, Washington, we also operate research and development facilities in other parts of the U.S. and around the world. This global approach helps us remain competitive in local markets and enables us to continue to attract top talent from across the world. We plan to continue to make significant investments in a broad range of product research and development activities, and as appropriate we will coordinate our research and development across operating segments and leverage the results across the Company. In addition to our main research and development operations, we also operate Microsoft Research. Microsoft Research is one of the world’s largest corporate research organizations and works in close collaboration with top universities around the world to advance the state-of-the-art in computer science and a broad range of other disciplines, providing us a unique perspective on future trends and contributing to our innovation. DISTRIBUTION, SALES, AND MARKETING We market and distribute our products and services through the following channels: OEMs, direct, and distributors and resellers. Our sales force performs a variety of functions, including working directly with commercial enterprises and public-sector organizations worldwide to identify and meet their technology and digital transformation requirements; managing OEM relationships; and supporting system integrators, independent software vendors, and other partners who engage directly with our customers to perform sales, consulting, and fulfillment functions for our products and services. 17 PART I Item 1 OEMs We distribute our products and services through OEMs that pre-install our software on new devices and servers they sell. The largest component of the OEM business is the Windows operating system pre-installed on devices. OEMs also sell devices pre-installed with other Microsoft products and services, including applications such as Office and the capability to subscribe to Office 365. There are two broad categories of OEMs. The largest category of OEMs are direct OEMs as our relationship with them is managed through a direct agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all the multinational OEMs, including Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, and with many regional and local OEMs. The second broad category of OEMs are system builders consisting of lower-volume PC manufacturers, which source Microsoft software for pre-installation and local redistribution primarily through the Microsoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft. Direct Many organizations that license our products and services transact directly with us through Enterprise Agreements and Enterprise Services contracts, with sales support from system integrators, independent software vendors, web agencies, and partners that advise organizations on licensing our products and services (“Enterprise Agreement Software Advisors” or “ESA”). Microsoft offers direct sales programs targeted to reach small, medium, and corporate customers, in addition to those offered through the reseller channel. A large network of partner advisors support many of these sales. We also sell commercial and consumer products and services directly to customers, such as cloud services, search, and gaming, through our digital marketplaces and online stores. In fiscal year 2021, we closed our Microsoft Store physical locations and opened our Microsoft Experience Centers. Microsoft Experience Centers are designed to facilitate deeper engagement with our partners and customers across industries. Distributors and Resellers Organizations also license our products and services indirectly, primarily through licensing solution partners (“LSP”), distributors, value-added resellers (“VAR”), and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner may reach organizations of all sizes, LSPs are primarily engaged with large organizations, distributors resell primarily to VARs, and VARs typically reach small and medium organizations. ESAs are also typically authorized as LSPs and operate as resellers for our other volume licensing programs. Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider is our main partner program for reselling cloud services. We distribute our retail packaged products primarily through independent non-exclusive distributors, authorized replicators, resellers, and retail outlets. Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets. We distribute our devices through third-party retailers. We have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers and provide product training and sales support. Our Dynamics business solutions are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and specialized services. LICENSING OPTIONS We offer options for organizations that want to purchase our cloud services, on-premises software, and SA. We license software to organizations under volume licensing agreements to allow the customer to acquire multiple licenses of products and services instead of having to acquire separate licenses through retail channels. We use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations of various sizes. While these programs may differ in various parts of the world, generally they include those discussed below. SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades for perpetual licenses released over the contract period. It also provides support, tools, training, and other licensing benefits to help customers deploy and use software efficiently. SA is included with certain volume licensing agreements and is an optional purchase with others. 18 PART I Item 1 Volume Licensing Programs Enterprise Agreement Enterprise Agreements offer large organizations a manageable volume licensing program that gives them the flexibility to buy cloud services and software licenses under one agreement. Enterprise Agreements are designed for medium or large organizations that want to license cloud services and on-premises software organization-wide over a three-year period. Organizations can elect to purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses. SA is included. Microsoft Customer Agreement A Microsoft Customer Agreement is a simplified purchase agreement presented, accepted, and stored through a digital experience. A Microsoft Customer Agreement is a non-expiring agreement that is designed to support all customers over time, whether purchasing through a partner or directly from Microsoft. Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement A Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement is designed for small and medium organizations that want to subscribe to, activate, provision, and maintain cloud services seamlessly and directly via the web.

RISK FACTORS Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock. STRATEGIC AND COMPETITIVE RISKS We face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins. Competition in the technology sector Our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small, specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical, marketing, and financial resources. Barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products, devices, and services that appeal to businesses and consumers. Competition among platform-based ecosystems An important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions. A well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users, application developers, and the platform provider that can accelerate growth. Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins. We face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms. • A competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements of a product and related services, has succeeded with some consumer products such as personal computers, tablets, phones, gaming consoles, wearables, and other endpoint devices. Competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform, including applications and content sold through their integrated marketplaces. They may also be able to claim security and performance benefits from their vertically integrated offer. We also offer some vertically-integrated hardware and software products and services. To the extent we shift a portion of our business to a vertically integrated model we increase our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margins. • We derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on PCs. We face significant competition from competing platforms developed for new devices and form factors such as smartphones and tablet computers. These devices compete on multiple bases including price and the perceived utility of the device and its platform. Users are increasingly turning to these devices to perform functions that in the past were performed by personal computers. Even if many users view these devices as complementary to a personal computer, the prevalence of these devices may make it more difficult to attract application developers to our PC operating system platforms. Competing with operating systems licensed at low or no cost may decrease our PC operating system margins. Popular products or services offered on competing platforms could increase their competitive strength. In addition, some of our devices compete with products made by our original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) partners, which may affect their commitment to our platform. • Competing platforms have content and application marketplaces with scale and significant installed bases. The variety and utility of content and applications available on a platform are important to device purchasing decisions. Users may incur costs to move data and buy new content and applications when switching platforms. To compete, we must successfully enlist developers to write applications for our platform and ensure that these applications have high quality, security, customer appeal, and value. Efforts to compete with competitors’ content and application marketplaces may increase our cost of revenue and lower our operating margins. Competitors’ rules governing their content and applications marketplaces may restrict our ability to distribute products and services through them in accordance with our technical and business model objectives. 23 PART I Item 1A Business model competition Companies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models. • Even as we transition more of our business to infrastructure-, platform-, and software-as-a-service business model, the license-based proprietary software model generates a substantial portion of our software revenue. We bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenue received from licensing our products. Many of our competitors also develop and sell software to businesses and consumers under this model. • Other competitors develop and offer free applications, online services and content, and make money by selling third-party advertising. Advertising revenue funds development of products and services these competitors provide to users at no or little cost, competing directly with our revenue-generating products. • Some companies compete with us by modifying and then distributing open source software at little or no cost to end users, and earning revenue on advertising or integrated products and services. These firms do not bear the full costs of research and development for the open source software. Some open source software mimics the features and functionality of our products. The competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for research and development, marketing, and sales incentives. This may lead to lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income. Our increasing focus on cloud-based services presents execution and competitive risks. A growing part of our business involves cloud-based services available across the spectrum of computing devices. Our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building best-in-class platforms and productivity services for an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with artificial intelligence (“AI”). At the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and business customers. Pricing and delivery models are evolving. Devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user’s choice of which cloud-based services to use. We are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies. The Windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment. We embrace cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation. Our intelligent cloud and intelligent edge worldview is connected with the growth of the Internet of Things (“IoT”). Our success in the IoT will depend on the level of adoption of our offerings such as Azure, Azure Stack, Azure IoT Edge, and Azure Sphere. We may not establish market share sufficient to achieve scale necessary to meet our business objectives. Besides software development costs, we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services. These costs will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved. Whether we succeed in cloud-based services depends on our execution in several areas, including: • Continuing to bring to market compelling cloud-based experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share. • Maintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance of our cloud-based services on the growing array of computing devices, including PCs, smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, and other devices, as well as sensors and other IoT endpoints. • Continuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third-party developers. • Ensuring our cloud-based services meet the reliability expectations of our customers and maintain the security of their data as well as help them meet their own compliance needs. • Making our suite of cloud-based services platform-agnostic, available on a wide range of devices and ecosystems, including those of our competitors. It is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed. If we are not effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services, we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above. This may negatively impact gross margins and operating income. 24 PART I Item 1A RISKS RELATING TO THE EVOLUTION OF OUR BUSINESS We make significant investments in products and services that may not achieve expected returns. We will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the Windows operating system, Microsoft 365, Office, Bing, SQL Server, Windows Server, Azure, Office 365, Xbox, LinkedIn, and other products and services. We also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment including PCs, tablets, gaming devices, and HoloLens. Investments in new technology are speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. We may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. New products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically. We may not get engagement in certain features, like Edge and Bing, that drive post-sale monetization opportunities. Our data handling practices across our products and services will continue to be under scrutiny and perceptions of mismanagement, driven by regulatory activity or negative public reaction to our practices or product experiences, could negatively impact product and feature adoption, product design, and product quality. Developing new technologies is complex. It can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue. Acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business. We expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. For example, in March 2021 we completed our acquisition of ZeniMax Media Inc. for $8.1 billion, and in March 2022 we completed our acquisition of Nuance Communications, Inc. for $18.8 billion. In January 2022 we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Activision Blizzard , Inc. for $68.7 billion. These acquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks, including that they do not advance our business strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment, that they raise new compliance-related obligations and challenges, that we have difficulty integrating and retaining new employees, business systems, and technology, that they distract management from our other businesses, or that announced transactions may not be completed. If an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party, it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement. The success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones, as well as acquired companies’ ability to meet our policies and processes in areas such as data governance, privacy, and cybersecurity. It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements such as increased revenue or enhanced efficiencies, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected. These events could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements. If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings. We acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. We review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate. We have in the past recorded, and may in the future be required to record, a significant charge in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively affecting our results of operations. 25 PART I Item 1A CYBERSECURITY, DATA PRIVACY, AND PLATFORM ABUSE RISKS Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our reputation or competitive position. Security of our information technology Threats to IT security can take a variety of forms. Individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including state-sponsored organizations or nation-states, continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our IT. These actors may use a wide variety of methods, which may include developing and deploying malicious software or exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware, software, or other infrastructure in order to attack our products and services or gain access to our networks and datacenters, using social engineering techniques to induce our employees, users, partners, or customers to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users’ or customers’ data, or acting in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks. Nation-state and state-sponsored actors can deploy significant resources to plan and carry out exploits. Nation-state attacks against us or our customers may intensify during periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access to confidential data. For example, system administrators may fail to timely remove employee account access when no longer appropriate. Employees or third parties may intentionally compromise our or our users’ security or systems or reveal confidential information. Malicious actors may employ the IT supply chain to introduce malware through software updates or compromised supplier accounts or hardware. Cyberthreats are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. We may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities, which may allow them to persist in the environment over long periods of time. Cyberthreats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and customers. Breaches of our facilities, network, or data security could disrupt the security of our systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in product development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, subject us to ransomware attacks, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies or remediate the impacts of attacks, or otherwise adversely affect our business. The cyberattacks uncovered in late 2020 known as “Solorigate” or “Nobelium” are an example of a supply chain attack where malware was introduced to a software provider’s customers, including us, through software updates. The attackers were later able to create false credentials that appeared legitimate to certain customers’ systems. We may be targets of further attacks similar to Solorigate/Nobelium as both a supplier and consumer of IT. In addition, our internal IT environment continues to evolve. Often, we are early adopters of new devices and technologies. We embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies. Our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge, or emerging cybersecurity regulations in jurisdictions worldwide. 26 PART I Item 1A Security of our products, services, devices, and customers’ data The security of our products and services is important in our customers’ decisions to purchase or use our products or services across cloud and on-premises environments. Security threats are a significant challenge to companies like us whose business is providing technology products and services to others. Threats to our own IT infrastructure can also affect our customers. Customers using our cloud-based services rely on the security of our infrastructure, including hardware and other elements provided by third parties, to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data. Adversaries tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and services, including many of ours, and we expect that to continue. In addition, adversaries can attack our customers’ on-premises or cloud environments, sometimes exploiting previously unknown (“zero day”) vulnerabilities, such as occurred in early calendar year 2021 with several of our Exchange Server on-premises products. Vulnerabilities in these or any product can persist even after we have issued security patches if customers have not installed the most recent updates, or if the attackers exploited the vulnerabilities before patching to install additional malware to further compromise customers’ systems. Adversaries will continue to attack customers using our cloud services as customers embrace digital transformation. Adversaries that acquire user account information can use that information to compromise our users’ accounts, including where accounts share the same attributes such as passwords. Inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access, and user activity may result in ransomware or other malicious software impacting a customer’s use of our products or services. We are increasingly incorporating open source software into our products. There may be vulnerabilities in open source software that may make our products susceptible to cyberattacks. Our customers operate complex IT systems with third-party hardware and software from multiple vendors that may include systems acquired over many years. They expect our products and services to support all these systems and products, including those that no longer incorporate the strongest current security advances or standards. As a result, we may not be able to discontinue support in our services for a product, service, standard, or feature solely because a more secure alternative is available. Failure to utilize the most current security advances and standards can increase our customers’ vulnerability to attack. Further, customers of widely varied size and technical sophistication use our technology, and consequently may have limited capabilities and resources to help them adopt and implement state of the art cybersecurity practices and technologies. In addition, we must account for this wide variation of technical sophistication when defining default settings for our products and services, including security default settings, as these settings may limit or otherwise impact other aspects of IT operations and some customers may have limited capability to review and reset these defaults. Cyberattacks such as Solorigate/Nobelium may adversely impact our customers even if our production services are not directly compromised. We are committed to notifying our customers whose systems have been impacted as we become aware and have available information and actions for customers to help protect themselves. We are also committed to providing guidance and support on detection, tracking, and remediation. We may not be able to detect the existence or extent of these attacks for all of our customers or have information on how to detect or track an attack, especially where an attack involves on-premises software such as Exchange Server where we may have no or limited visibility into our customers’ computing environments. Development and deployment of defensive measures To defend against security threats to our internal IT systems, our cloud-based services, and our customers’ systems, we must continuously engineer more secure products and services, enhance security and reliability features, improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities in our own products as well as those provided by others, develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network, products, and services, and provide security tools such as firewalls, anti-virus software, and advanced security and information about the need to deploy security measures and the impact of doing so. Customers in certain industries such as financial services, health care, and government may have enhanced or specialized requirements to which we must engineer our products and services. 27 PART I Item 1A The cost of measures to protect products and customer-facing services could reduce our operating margins. If we fail to do these things well, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services, data corruption issues, or reduced performance could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services, or to use competing products or services. Customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional products or services. Customers, and third parties granted access to their systems, may fail to update their systems, continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support, or may fail timely to install or enable security patches, or may otherwise fail to adopt adequate security practices. Any of these could adversely affect our reputation and revenue. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. Our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, but there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges. At times, to achieve commercial objectives, we may enter into agreements with larger liability exposure to customers. Our products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem of third parties. If there is a security vulnerability in one of these components, and if there is a security exploit targeting it, we could face increased costs, liability claims, reduced revenue, or harm to our reputation or competitive position. Disclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation. As we continue to grow the number, breadth, and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personal data of our customers and users. The continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. Despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and third parties on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure or misuse of customer or user data we or our vendors store and manage. In addition, third parties who have limited access to our customer or user data may use this data in unauthorized ways. Improper disclosure or misuse could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers or users, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Our software products and services also enable our customers and users to store and process personal data on-premises or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment we host. Government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer or user data in response to valid legal orders. In the U.S. and elsewhere, we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure. Despite our efforts to protect customer and user data, perceptions that the collection, use, and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities. Additional security measures we may take to address customer or user concerns, or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer or user expectations or governmental rules or actions, may cause higher operating expenses or hinder growth of our products and services. We may not be able to protect information in our products and services from use by others . LinkedIn and other Microsoft products and services contain valuable information and content protected by contractual restrictions or technical measures. In certain cases, we have made commitments to our members and users to limit access to or use of this information. Changes in the law or interpretations of the law may weaken our ability to prevent third parties from scraping or gathering information or content through use of bots or other measures and using it for their own benefit, thus diminishing the value of our products and services. Abuse of our platforms may harm our reputation or user engagement. Advertising, professional, marketplace, and gaming platform abuses For platform products and services that provide content or host ads that come from or can be influenced by third parties, including GitHub, LinkedIn, Microsoft Advertising, Microsoft News, Microsoft Store, Bing, and Xbox, our reputation or user engagement may be negatively affected by activity that is hostile or inappropriate. This activity may come from users impersonating other people or organizations, dissemination of information that may be viewed as misleading or intended to manipulate the opinions of our users, or the use of our products or services that violates our terms of service or otherwise for objectionable or illegal ends. Preventing or responding to these actions may require us to make substantial investments in people and technology and these investments may not be successful, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements. 28 PART I Item 1A Other digital safety abuses Our hosted consumer services as well as our enterprise services may be used to disseminate harmful or illegal content in violation of our terms or applicable law. We may not proactively discover such content due to scale, the limitations of existing technologies, and conflicting legal frameworks. When discovered by users, such content may negatively affect our reputation, our brands, and user engagement. Regulations and other initiatives to make platforms responsible for preventing or eliminating harmful content online have been enacted, and we expect this to continue. We may be subject to enhanced regulatory oversight, civil or criminal liability, or reputational damage if we fail to comply with content moderation regulations, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements. The development of the IoT presents security, privacy, and execution risks. To support the growth of the intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge, we are developing products, services, and technologies to power the IoT, a network of distributed and interconnected devices employing sensors, data, and computing capabilities including AI. The IoT’s great potential also carries substantial risks. IoT products and services may contain defects in design, manufacture, or operation that make them insecure or ineffective for their intended purposes. An IoT solution has multiple layers of hardware, sensors, processors, software, and firmware, several of which we may not develop or control. Each layer, including the weakest layer, can impact the security of the whole system. Many IoT devices have limited interfaces and ability to be updated or patched. IoT solutions may collect large amounts of data, and our handling of IoT data may not satisfy customers or regulatory requirements. IoT scenarios may increasingly affect personal health and safety. If IoT solutions that include our technologies do not work as intended, violate the law, or harm individuals or businesses, we may be subject to legal claims or enforcement actions. These risks, if realized, may increase our costs, damage our reputation or brands, or negatively impact our revenues or margins. Issues in the development and use of AI may result in reputational harm or liability . We are building AI into many of our offerings, including our productivity services, and we are also making first- and third-party AI available for our customers to use in solutions that they build. We expect these elements of our business to grow. We envision a future in which AI operating in our devices, applications, and the cloud helps our customers be more productive in their work and personal lives. As with many innovations, AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. AI algorithms may be flawed. Datasets may be insufficient or contain biased information. Ineffective or inadequate AI development or deployment practices by Microsoft or others could result in incidents that impair the acceptance of AI solutions or cause harm to individuals or society. These deficiencies and other failures of AI systems could subject us to competitive harm, regulatory action, legal liability, including under new proposed legislation regulating AI in jurisdictions such as the European Union (“EU”), and brand or reputational harm. Some AI scenarios present ethical issues. If we enable or offer AI solutions that are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or other social, economic, or political issues, we may experience brand or reputational harm. OPERATIONAL RISKS We may have excessive outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure. Our increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power. We spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters. Our datacenters depend on predictable energy and networking supplies, the cost or availability of which could be adversely affected by a variety of factors, including the transition to a clean energy economy and geopolitical disruptions. These demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth of existing services such as Bing, Azure, Microsoft Account services, Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams, Dynamics 365, OneDrive, SharePoint Online, Skype, Xbox, and Outlook.com. We are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users. Maintaining, securing, and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex, and requires development of principles for datacenter builds in geographies with higher safety risks. It requires that we maintain an Internet connectivity infrastructure and storage and compute capacity that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve. Inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data, insufficient Internet connectivity, or inadequate storage and compute capacity, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, regulatory actions, damage to our reputation, and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may adversely impact our consolidated financial statements. 29 PART I Item 1A We may experience quality or supply problems. Our hardware products such as Xbox consoles, Surface devices, and other devices we design and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. We could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm as a result of recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims if we fail to prevent, detect, or address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs. Our software products and services also may experience quality or reliability problems. The highly sophisticated software we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. Our customers increasingly rely on us for critical business functions and multiple workloads. Many of our products and services are interdependent with one another. Each of these circumstances potentially magnifies the impact of quality or reliability issues. Any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability. Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge. There are limited suppliers for certain device and datacenter components. Our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us. If components are delayed or become unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint, industry shortages, legal or regulatory changes that restrict supply sources, or other reasons, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity. Component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue. Xbox consoles, Surface devices, datacenter servers, and other hardware are assembled in Asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins. LEGAL, REGULATORY, AND LITIGATION RISKS Government litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products. As a leading global software and device maker, government agencies closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign competition laws. Governments are actively enforcing competition laws and regulations, and this includes scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the EU, the U.S., and China. Some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. U.S. federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business. The European Commission (“the Commission”) closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume Microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. Flagship product releases such as Windows can receive significant scrutiny under competition laws. For example, in 2004, the Commission ordered us to create new versions of our Windows operating system that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary Windows communications protocols in their own products. In 2009, the Commission accepted a set of commitments we offered to address the Commission’s concerns relating to competition in web browsing software, including an undertaking to address Commission concerns relating to interoperability. The web browsing commitments expired in 2014. The remaining obligations may limit our ability to innovate in Windows or other products in the future, diminish the developer appeal of the Windows platform, and increase our product development costs. The availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our products, which could hamper sales of our products. Our portfolio of first-party devices continues to grow; at the same time our OEM partners offer a large variety of devices for our platforms. As a result, increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our OEM partners, creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules. Regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase. Certain foreign governments, particularly in China and other countries in Asia, have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property. 30 PART I Item 1A Government regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may result in fines or hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses, reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that come s from them. New competition law actions could be initiated, potentially using previous actions as precedent. The outcome of such actions, or steps taken to avoid them, could adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including: • We may have to choose between withdrawing products from certain geographies to avoid fines or designing and developing alternative versions of those products to comply with government rulings, which may entail a delay in a product release and removing functionality that customers want or on which developers rely. • We may be required to make available licenses to our proprietary technologies on terms that do not reflect their fair market value or do not protect our associated intellectual property. • We are subject to a variety of ongoing commitments because of court or administrative orders, consent decrees, or other voluntary actions we have taken. If we fail to comply with these commitments, we may incur litigation costs and be subject to substantial fines or other remedial actions. • Our ability to realize anticipated Windows post-sale monetization opportunities may be limited. • Regulatory scrutiny may inhibit our ability to consummate acquisitions or impose conditions that reduce the ultimate value of such transactions. Our global operations subject us to potential consequences under anti-corruption, trade, and other laws and regulations. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other anti-corruption laws and regulations (“Anti-Corruption Laws”) prohibit corrupt payments by our employees, vendors, or agents, and the accounting provisions of the FCPA require us to maintain accurate books and records and adequate internal controls. From time to time, we receive inquiries from authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere which may be based on reports from employees and others about our business activities outside the U.S. and our compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws. Periodically, we receive such reports directly and investigate them, and also cooperate with investigations by U.S. and foreign law enforcement authorities. An example of increasing international regulatory complexity is the EU Whistleblower Directive, initiated in 2021, which may present compliance challenges to the extent it is implemented in different forms by EU member states. Most countries in which we operate also have competition laws that prohibit competitors from colluding or otherwise attempting to reduce competition between themselves. While we devote substantial resources to our U.S. and international compliance programs and have implemented policies, training, and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments and collusive activity, our employees, vendors, or agents may violate our policies. Our failure to comply with Anti-Corruption Laws or competition laws could result in significant fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Increasing trade laws, policies, sanctions, and other regulatory requirements also affect our operations in and outside the U.S. relating to trade and investment. Economic sanctions in the U.S., the EU, and other countries prohibit most business with restricted entities or countries such as Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria. U.S. export controls restrict Microsoft from offering many of its products and services to, or making investments in, certain entities in specified countries. U.S. import controls restrict us from integrating certain information and communication technologies into our supply chain and allow for government review of transactions involving information and communications technology from countries determined to be foreign adversaries. Periods of intense diplomatic or armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, may result in (1) new and rapidly evolving sanctions and trade restrictions, which may impair trade with sanctioned individuals and countries, and (2) negative impacts to regional trade ecosystems among our customers, partners, and us. Non-compliance with sanctions as well as general ecosystem disruptions could result in reputational harm, operational delays, monetary fines, loss of revenues, increased costs, loss of export privileges, or criminal sanctions. 31 PART I Item 1A Other regulatory areas that may apply to our products and online services offerings include requirements related to user privacy, telecommunications, data storage and protection, advertising, and online content. For example, some regulators are taking the position that our offerings such as Microsoft Teams and Skype are covered by existing laws regulating telecommunications services, and some new laws , including EU Member State laws under the European Electronic Communications Code, are defining more of our services as regulated telecommunications services. This trend may continue and will result in these offerings being subjected to additional data protection, security, and law enforcement surveillance obligations. Regulators may assert that our collection, use, and management of customer data and other information is inconsistent with their laws and regulations , including laws that apply to the tracking of users via technology such as cookies . Legislative or regulatory action relating to cybersecurity requirements may increase the costs to develop, implement, or secure our products and services. Legislative and regulatory action is emerging in the area s of AI and content moderation, which could increase costs or restrict opportunity. Applying these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Additionally, these laws and governments’ approach to their enforcement, and our products and services, are continuing to evolve. Compliance with these types of regulation may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we stop the alleged noncompliant activity. We strive to empower all people and organizations to achieve more, and accessibility of our products is an important aspect of this goal. There is increasing pressure from advocacy groups, regulators, competitors, customers, and other stakeholders to make technology more accessible. If our products do not meet customer expectations or global accessibility requirements, we could lose sales opportunities or face regulatory or legal actions. Laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased costs, legal claims, fines against us, or reputational damage. The growth of our Internet- and cloud-based services internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries. Legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, and transfer of personal data continue to evolve. For example, in July 2020 the Court of Justice of the EU invalidated a framework called Privacy Shield for companies to transfer data from EU member states to the United States. This ruling continues to generate uncertainty about the legal requirements for data transfers from the EU under other legal mechanisms and has resulted in some EU data protection authorities blocking the use of U.S.-based services that involve the transfer of data to the U.S. The U.S. and the EU in March 2022 agreed in principle on a replacement framework for the Privacy Shield, called the Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework. A failure of the U.S. and EU to finalize the Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework could compound that uncertainty and result in additional blockages of data transfers. Potential new rules and restrictions on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services in some markets. For example, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to products and services offered in the EU, imposes a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data. More recently, the EU has been developing new requirements related to the use of data, including in the Digital Markets Act, the Digital Services Act, and the Data Act, that will add additional rules and restriction on the use of data in our products and services. Engineering efforts to build and maintain capabilities to facilitate compliance with these laws involve substantial expense and the diversion of engineering resources from other projects. We might experience reduced demand for our offerings if we are unable to engineer products that meet our legal duties or help our customers meet their obligations under the GDPR and other data regulations, or if our implementation to comply with the GDPR makes our offerings less attractive. Compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them. If we fail to comply, or if regulators assert we have failed to comply (including in response to complaints made by customers), it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions, which can result in monetary penalties (of up to 4% of worldwide revenue in the case of GDPR), private lawsuits, reputational damage, blockage of international data transfers, and loss of customers. The highest fines assessed under GDPR have recently been increasing, especially against large technology companies. Jurisdictions around the world, such as China, India, and states in the U.S. have adopted, or are considering adopting or expanding, laws and regulations imposing obligations regarding the handling or transfer of personal data. 32 PART I Item 1A The Company’s investment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the value of the services we deliver to customers, to our operational efficiency and key opportunities in monetization, customer perceptions of quality, and operational efficiency. Our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory developments that impede realizing the expected return from this investment. Ongoing legal analyses, reviews, and inquiries by regulators of Microsoft practices, or relevant practices of other organizations, may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements, including data sovereignty and localization requirements, affecting the location, movement, collection, and use of our customer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding personal data may require changes in services, business practices, or internal systems that result in increased costs, lower revenue, reduced efficiency, or greater difficulty in competing with foreign-based firms. Compliance with data regulations might limit our ability to innovate or offer certain features and functionality in some jurisdictions where we operate. Failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity, as well as negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort. We have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes. We are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. These claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives, including major new product releases such as Windows, significant business transactions, warranty or product claims, and employment practices. Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. The litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. A material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Our business with government customers may present additional uncertainties. We derive substantial revenue from government contracts. Government contracts generally can present risks and challenges not present in private commercial agreements. For instance, we may be subject to government audits and investigations relating to these contracts, we could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor, we could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, and under certain circumstances contracts may be rescinded. Some agreements may allow a government to terminate without cause and provide for higher liability limits for certain losses. Some contracts may be subject to periodic funding approval, reductions, or delays which could adversely impact public-sector demand for our products and services. These events could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition, and reputation. We may have additional tax liabilities. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, compliance with the 2017 United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) and possible future legislative changes may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the Company, the use of estimates in our consolidated financial statements, and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions. As regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the TCJA or possible future legislative changes, and as we gather more information and perform more analysis, our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements. We regularly are under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. Although we believe that our provision for income taxes and our tax estimates are reasonable, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken. In addition, economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. We are currently under Internal Revenue Service audit for prior tax years, with the primary unresolved issues relating to transfer pricing. The final resolution of those audits, and other audits or litigation, may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made. We earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S. A change in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our business or structure, or the expiration of or disputes about certain tax agreements in a particular country may result in higher effective tax rates for the Company. In addition, changes in U.S. federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries, including in the U.S., and changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions may materially adversely impact our consolidated financial statements. 33 PART I Item 1A INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS We may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure. Source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. Although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to several licensees, we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code. If our source code leaks, we might lose future trade secret protection for that code. It may then become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. Unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described elsewhere in these risk factors. Legal changes, our evolving business model, piracy, and other factors may decrease the value of our intellectual property. Protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property on a global basis is difficult. While piracy adversely affects U.S. revenue, the impact on revenue from outside the U.S. is more significant, particularly countries in which the legal system provides less protection for intellectual property rights. Our revenue in these markets may grow more slowly than the underlying device market. Similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights. Throughout the world, we educate users about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks, and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. Reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue. We expend significant resources to patent the intellectual property we create with the expectation that we will generate revenues by incorporating that intellectual property in our products or services or, in some instances, by licensing or cross-licensing our patents to others in return for a royalty and/or increased freedom to operate. Changes in the law may continue to weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patents. These include legislative changes and regulatory actions that make it more difficult to obtain injunctions, and the increasing use of legal process to challenge issued patents. Similarly, licensees of our patents may fail to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties or may contest the scope and extent of their obligations. The royalties we can obtain to monetize our intellectual property may decline because of the evolution of technology, price changes in products using licensed patents, greater value from cross-licensing, or the difficulty of discovering infringements. Finally, our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations and may negatively impact revenue. Third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. From time to time, others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. The number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the markets in which we compete, the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies, the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, and our offering of first-party devices, such as Surface. To resolve these claims, we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available, stop selling or redesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. These outcomes may cause operating margins to decline. Besides money damages, in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies. In some countries, such as Germany, an injunction can be issued before the parties have fully litigated the validity of the underlying patents. We have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk, and may continue to do so. GENERAL RISKS If our reputation or our brands are damaged, our business and operating results may be harmed . Our reputation and brands are globally recognized and are important to our business. Our reputation and brands affect our ability to attract and retain consumer, business, and public-sector customers. There are numerous ways our reputation or brands could be damaged. These include product safety or quality issues, our environmental impact and sustainability, supply chain practices, or human rights record. We may experience backlash from customers, government entities, advocacy groups, employees, and other stakeholders that disagree with our product offering decisions or public policy positions. Damage to our reputation or our brands may occur from, among other things: • The introduction of new features, products, services, or terms of service that customers, users, or partners do not like. 34 PART I Item 1A • Public scrutiny of our decisions regarding user privacy, data practices, or content. • Data security breaches, compliance failures, or actions of partners or individual employees. The proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood, speed, and magnitude of negative brand events. If our brands or reputation are damaged, it could negatively impact our revenues or margins, or ability to attract the most highly qualified employees. Adverse economic or market conditions may harm our business. Worsening economic conditions, including inflation, recession, pandemic, or other changes in economic conditions, may cause lower IT spending and adversely affect our revenue. If demand for PCs, servers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected. Our product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network. OEMs building devices that run our software have also been a significant means of distribution. The impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, OEM, or retailer, could cause sales channel disruption. Challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. As a result, allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase. We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that affect global financial markets. A significant part of our investment portfolio comprises U.S. government securities. If global financial markets decline for long periods, or if there is a downgrade of the U.S. government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt, our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced a decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements. Catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business. A disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyberattack, terrorist attack, pandemic, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other critical functions. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other essential business operations are in the Seattle, Washington area, and we have other business operations in the Silicon Valley area of California, both of which are seismically active regions. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems, or the infrastructure or systems they rely on, such as power grids, could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations. Providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages in our consolidated financial statements. Abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries, which may increase our operating costs and negatively impact our ability to sell to and collect from customers in affected markets. These conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers. Geopolitical change may result in changing regulatory systems and requirements and market interventions that could impact our operating strategies, access to national, regional, and global markets, hiring, and profitability. Geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some markets or with some public-sector customers. Any of these changes may negatively impact our revenues. The occurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic such as COVID-19 may adversely affect our operations, financial condition, and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has had widespread, rapidly evolving, and unpredictable impacts on global society, economies, financial markets, and business practices. The extent to which global pandemics impact our business going forward will depend on factors such as the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business, and individuals' actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity including the possibility of recession or financial market instability. 35 PART I Item 1A Measures to contain a global pandemic may intensify other risks described in these Risk Factors. Any of these measures may adversely impact our ability to: • Maintain our operations infrastructure, including the reliability and adequate capacity of cloud services. • Satisfy our contractual and regulatory compliance obligations as we adapt to changing usage patterns, such as through datacenter load balancing. • Ensure a high-quality and consistent supply chain and manufacturing operations for our hardware devices and datacenter operations. • Effectively manage our international operations through changes in trade practices and policies. • Hire and deploy people where we most need them. • Sustain the effectiveness and productivity of our operations including our sales, marketing, engineering, and distribution functions. We may incur increased costs to effectively manage these aspects of our business. If we are unsuccessful it may adversely impact our revenues, cash flows, market share growth, and reputation. The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the IT industry in particular are unclear. Environmental regulations or changes in the supply, demand or available sources of energy or other resources may affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our business. Changes in climate where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud-based services. Our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks. Our customers are located throughout the world and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. The global nature of our business creates operational, economic, and geopolitical risks. Our results of operations may be affected by global, regional, and local economic developments, monetary policy, inflation, and recession, as well as political and military disputes. In addition, our international growth strategy includes certain markets, the developing nature of which presents several risks, including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. Emerging nationalist and protectionist trends and concerns about human rights and political expression in specific countries may significantly alter the trade and commercial environments. Changes to trade policy or agreements as a result of populism, protectionism, or economic nationalism may result in higher tariffs, local sourcing initiatives, and non-local sourcing restrictions, export controls, investment restrictions, or other developments that make it more difficult to sell our products in foreign countries. Disruptions of these kinds in developed or emerging markets could negatively impact demand for our products and services or increase operating costs. Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our results of operations. Our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees. Our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. Maintaining our brand and reputation, as well as a diverse and inclusive work environment that enables all our employees to thrive, are important to our ability to recruit and retain employees. We are also limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. Changes to U.S. immigration policies that restrain the flow of technical and professional talent may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development efforts. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. How employment-related laws are interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs. Our global workforce is primarily non-unionized, but we have several unions and works councils outside of the United States. In the U.S., there has been a general increase in workers exercising their right to form or join a union. While Microsoft has not received such petitions in the U.S., the unionization of significant employee populations could result in higher costs and other operational changes necessary to respond to changing conditions and to establish new relationships with worker representatives. 36 PART I Item 1B, 2, 3, 4 ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS We have received no written comments regarding our periodic or current reports from the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of our fiscal year 2022 that remain unresolved.

OVERVIEW Microsoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. We strive to create local opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world. Our platforms and tools help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness, and public-sector efficiency. They also support new startups, improve educational and health outcomes, and empower human ingenuity. We generate revenue by offering a wide range of cloud-based and other services to people and businesses; licensing and supporting an array of software products; designing, manufacturing, and selling devices; and delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience. Our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees; designing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling our products and services; datacenter costs in support of our cloud-based services; and income taxes. Highlights from fiscal year 2022 compared with fiscal year 2021 included: • Microsoft Cloud (formerly commercial cloud) revenue increased 32% to $91.2 billion. • Office Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 13% driven by Office 365 Commercial growth of 18%. • Office Consumer products and cloud services revenue increased 11% and Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 59.7 million. • LinkedIn revenue increased 34%. • Dynamics products and cloud services revenue increased 25% driven by Dynamics 365 growth of 39%. • Server products and cloud services revenue increased 28% driven by Azure and other cloud services growth of 45%. • Windows original equipment manufacturer licensing (“Windows OEM”) revenue increased 11%. • Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 11%. • Xbox content and services revenue increased 3%. • Search and news advertising revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs increased 27%. • Surface revenue increased 3%. On March 4, 2022, we completed our acquisition of Nuance Communications, Inc. (“Nuance”) for a total purchase price of $18.8 billion, consisting primarily of cash. Nuance is a cloud and artificial intelligence (“AI”) software provider with healthcare and enterprise AI experience, and the acquisition will build on our industry-specific cloud offerings. The financial results of Nuance have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition. Nuance is reported as part of our Intelligent Cloud segment. Refer to Note 8 – Business Combinations of the Notes to Financial Statements ( Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K ) for further discussion. Industry Trends Our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces. 40 PART II Item 7 Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks The markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud, and in some cases, the user’s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. The investments we are making in infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins. Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one’s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. Our devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers, some of which contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. For these components, we have limited near-term flexibility to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or is unable to meet our requirements. Extended disruptions at these suppliers and/or manufacturers could lead to a similar disruption in our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand. Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies did not have a material impact on reported revenue or expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2022. Refer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) for a discussion of these factors and other risks. Seasonality Our revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Second quarter revenue is driven by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period. Reportable Segments We report our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing. The segment amounts included in MD&A are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting. Additional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 19 – Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). Metrics We use metrics in assessing the performance of our business and to make informed decisions regarding the allocation of resources. We disclose metrics to enable investors to evaluate progress against our ambitions, provide transparency into performance trends, and reflect the continued evolution of our products and services. Our commercial and other business metrics are fundamentally connected based on how customers use our products and services. The metrics are disclosed in the MD&A or the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). Financial metrics are calculated based on financial results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), and growth comparisons relate to the corresponding period of last fiscal year. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we made updates to the presentation and method of calculation for certain metrics, most notably changes to incorporate all current and anticipated revenue streams within our Office Consumer and Server products and cloud services metrics and changes to align with how we manage our Windows OEM and Search and news advertising businesses. None of these changes had a material impact on previously reported amounts in our MD&A. 41 PART II Item 7 In the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, we completed our acquisition of Nuance. Nuance is included in all commercial metrics and our Server products and cloud services revenue growth metric. Azure and other cloud services revenue includes Nuance cloud services, and Server products revenue includes Nuance on-premises offerings. Commercial Our commercial business primarily consists of Server products and cloud services, Office Commercial, Windows Commercial, the commercial portion of LinkedIn, Enterprise Services, and Dynamics.

Gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net. Interest and dividends income decreased due to lower portfolio balances. Interest expense decreased due to a decrease in outstanding long-term debt due to debt maturities. Net recognized gains on investments decreased primarily due to lower gains on equity securities. INCOME TAXES Effective Tax Rate Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 was 13% and 14%, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer of intangible properties, offset in part by changes in the mix of our income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries, as well as tax benefits in the prior year from the India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes in the case of Engineering Analysis Centre of Excellent Private Limited vs The Commissioner of Income Tax, an agreement between the U.S. and India tax authorities related to transfer pricing, and final Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) regulations. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we transferred certain intangible properties from our Puerto Rico subsidiary to the U.S. The transfer of intangible properties resulted in a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, as the value of future U.S. tax deductions exceeds the current tax liability from the U.S. global intangible low-taxed income tax. We have historically paid India withholding taxes on software sales through distributor withholding and tax audit assessments in India. In March 2021, the India Supreme Court ruled favorably for companies in 86 separate appeals, some dating back to 2012, holding that software sales are not subject to India withholding taxes. Although we were not a party to the appeals, our software sales in India were determined to be not subject to withholding taxes. Therefore, we recorded a net income tax benefit of $620 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 to reflect the results of the India Supreme Court decision impacting fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2016. Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to the net income tax benefit related to the transfer of intangible properties, earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland, and tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. The mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. In fiscal year 2022, our U.S. income before income taxes was $47.8 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $35.9 billion. In fiscal year 2021, our U.S. income before income taxes was $35.0 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $36.1 billion. 47 PART II Item 7 Uncertain Tax Positions We settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011. In February 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. We also settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in fiscal year 2016, and a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we settled an additional portion of the IRS audits for tax years 2004 to 2013 and made a payment of $1.7 billion, including tax and interest. We remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2017. As of June 30, 2022, the primary unresolved issues for the IRS audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have a material impact in our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved. We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved key transfer pricing issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2021, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures which exclude the net tax benefit related to the transfer of intangible properties in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 and the net income tax benefit related to an India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021. We believe these non-GAAP measures aid investors by providing additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify trends affecting our business. For comparability of reporting, management considers non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP financial results in evaluating business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures presented should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table reconciles our financial results reported in accordance with GAAP to non-GAAP financial results: (In millions, except percentages and per share amounts) 2022 2021 Percentage Change Net income $ 72,738 $ 61,271 19% Net income tax benefit related to transfer of intangible properties (3,291 ) 0 * Net income tax benefit related to India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes 0 (620 ) * Adjusted net income (non-GAAP) $ 69,447 $ 60,651 15% Diluted earnings per share $ 9.65 $ 8.05 20% Net income tax benefit related to transfer of intangible properties (0.44 ) 0 * Net income tax benefit related to India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes 0 (0.08 ) * Adjusted diluted earnings per share (non-GAAP) $ 9.21 $ 7.97 16% * Not meaningful. 48 PART II Item 7 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as dividends, share repurchases, debt maturities, material capital expenditures, and the transition tax related to the TCJA, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $104.8 billion and $130.3 billion as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Equity investments were $6.9 billion and $6.0 billion as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities. Valuation In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Level 3 investments are valued using internally-developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio. A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate. Cash Flows Cash from operations increased $12.3 billion to $89.0 billion for fiscal year 2022, mainly due to an increase in cash received from customers, offset in part by an increase in cash paid to suppliers and employees. Cash used in financing increased $10.4 billion to $58.9 billion for fiscal year 2022, mainly due to a $5.3 billion increase in common stock repurchases and a $5.3 billion increase in repayments of debt. Cash used in investing increased $2.7 billion to $30.3 billion for fiscal year 2022, mainly due to a $13.1 billion increase in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets, and a $3.3 billion increase in additions to property and equipment, offset in part by a $15.6 billion increase in cash from net investment purchases, sales, and maturities. 49 PART II Item 7 Debt Proceeds We issue debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment. The proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt. In March 2021 and June 2020, we exchanged a portion of our existing debt at a premium for cash and new debt with longer maturities to take advantage of favorable financing rates in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment. Refer to Note 11 – Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. Unearned Revenue Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include Software Assurance (“SA”) and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service. Refer to Note 1 – Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. The following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of June 30, 2022: (In millions) Three Months Ending September 30, 2022 $ 17,691 December 31, 2022 13,923 March 31, 2023 9,491 June 30, 2023 4,433 Thereafter 2,870 Total $ 48,408 If our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction-based products and services, the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption, as applicable. 50 PART II Item 7 Material Cash Requirements and Other Obligations Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the payments due by fiscal year for our outstanding contractual obligations as of June 30, 2022: (In millions) 2023 Thereafter Total Long-term debt: (a) Principal payments $ 2,750 $ 52,761 $ 55,511 Interest payments 1,468 21,139 22,607 Construction commitments (b) 7,942 576 8,518 Operating and finance leases, including imputed interest (c) 4,609 44,045 48,654 Purchase commitments ( d ) 42,669 2,985 45,654 Total $ 59,438 $ 121,506 $ 180,944 ( a) Refer to Note 11 – Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).

Income Taxes As a result of the TCJA, we are required to pay a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to U.S. income tax. Under the TCJA, the transition tax is payable in interest-free installments over eight years, with 8% due in each of the first five years, 15% in year six, 20% in year seven, and 25% in year eight. We have paid transition tax of $6.2 billion, which included $1.5 billion for fiscal year 2022. The remaining transition tax of $12.0 billion is payable over the next four years, with $1.3 billion payable within 12 months. Provisions enacted in the TCJA related to the capitalization for tax purposes of research and experimental expenditures became effective on July 1, 2022. These provisions require us to capitalize research and experimental expenditures and amortize them on the U.S. tax return over five or fifteen years, depending on where research is conducted. The final foreign tax credit regulations, also effective on July 1, 2022, introduced significant changes to foreign tax credit calculations in the U.S. tax return. While these provisions are not expected to have a material impact on our fiscal year 2023 effective tax rate on a net basis, our cash paid for taxes would increase unless these provisions are postponed or modified through legislative processes. Share Repurchases During fiscal years 2022 and 2021, we repurchased 95 million shares and 101 million shares of our common stock for $28.0 billion and $23.0 billion, respectively, through our share repurchase programs. All repurchases were made using cash resources. As of June 30, 2022, $40.7 billion remained of our $60 billion share repurchase program. Refer to Note 16 – Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. Dividends During fiscal year 2022, our Board of Directors declared quarterly dividends of $0.62 per share. We intend to continue returning capital to shareholders in the form of dividends, subject to declaration by our Board of Directors. Refer to Note 16 – Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. 51 PART II Item 7 Other Planned Uses of Capital On January 18, 2022 , we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Activision Blizzard , Inc. (“Activision Blizzard” ) for $ 95 .00 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at $ 68 .7 billion, inclusive of Activision Blizzard’s net cash. The acquisition has been approved by Activision Blizzard’s shareholders, and we expect it to close in fiscal year 2023, subject to the satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology, as well as continue making acquisitions that align with our business strategy. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, datacenters, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years to support growth in our cloud offerings. We have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, Microsoft Experience Centers, and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources. RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE Refer to Note 1 – Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, legal and other contingencies, income taxes, and inventories. Revenue Recognition Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided. Judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price (“SSP"") for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP. Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers. 52 PART II Item 7 Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented. Impairment of Investment Securities We review debt investments quarterly for credit losses and impairment. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment indicates that the investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. We perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis. We are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine the amount of the impairment loss. Once an investment is determined to be impaired, an impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net. Goodwill We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. Research and Development Costs Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to production. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products. 53 PART II Item 7 Legal and Other Contingencies The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. Income Taxes The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. Inventories Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. These reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE In July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four years to six years. This change in accounting estimate will be effective beginning fiscal year 2023. Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and equipment, net as of June 30, 2022, it is estimated this change will increase our fiscal year 2023 operating income by $3.7 billion. We had previously increased the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment in July 2020. 54 PART II Item 7 STATEMENT OF MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report. The consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management’s estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing consolidated financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. These systems are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits. The Company engaged Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit and render an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). The Board of Directors, through its Audit Committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the Company, meets periodically with management, internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting. Deloitte & Touche LLP and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the Audit Committee. Satya Nadella Chief Executive Officer Amy E. Hood Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Alice L. Jolla Corporate Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer 55 PART II Item 7A ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK RISKS We are exposed to economic risk from foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, and equity prices. We use derivatives instruments to manage these risks, however, they may still impact our consolidated financial statements. Foreign Currencies Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions, including hedges. Principal currency exposures include the Euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar. Interest Rate Securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We manage the average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global fixed-income indices. Credit Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Equity Securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to price risk.

We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. The recast of these prior period amounts had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income statements, or consolidated cash flows statements. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Estimates and Assumptions Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the standalone selling price (“SSP”) of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand for, our inventory; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties. In July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined we should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four years to six years . This change in accounting estimate will be effective beginning fiscal year 2023. We had previously increased the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment in July 2020. Foreign Currencies Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income. Revenue Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue Product revenue includes sales from operating systems, cross-device productivity applications, server applications, business solution applications, desktop and server management tools, software development tools, video games, and hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories. Service and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content such as Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and Xbox; solution support; and consulting services. Service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising and LinkedIn. 62 PART II Item 8 Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. Nature of Products and Services Licenses for on-premises software provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available to the customer. Customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide customers with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Revenue from distinct on-premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. In cases where we allocate revenue to software updates, primarily because the updates are provided at no additional charge, revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the estimated life of the related device or license. Certain volume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements, include on-premises licenses combined with Software Assurance (“SA”). SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and provides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use products more efficiently. On-premises licenses are considered distinct performance obligations when sold with SA. Revenue allocated to SA is generally recognized ratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits, given that SA comprises distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time. Cloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software, are provided on either a subscription or consumption basis. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is recognized based on the customer utilization of such resources. When cloud services require a significant level of integration and interdependency with software and the individual components are not considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud services are provided. Revenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. Revenue from consulting services is recognized as services are provided. Our hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot function without the operating system. In these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to resellers or directly to end customers through retail stores and online marketplaces. Refer to Note 19 – Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information, including revenue by significant product and service offering. Significant Judgments Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided. 63 PART II Item 8 Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP. Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers. Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented. Contract Balances and Other Receivables Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. We record a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. For multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. We record a receivable related to revenue recognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we have an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those licenses. Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include SA and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the future, LinkedIn subscriptions, Office 365 subscriptions, Xbox subscriptions, Windows post-delivery support, Dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service. Refer to Note 13 – Unearned Revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes in unearned revenue during the period. Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers with financing. Examples include invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year on-premises licenses that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront. As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, other receivables due from suppliers were $ 1.0 billion and $ 965 million, respectively, and are included in accounts receivable, net in our consolidated balance sheets. As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $ 3.8 billion and $ 3.4 billion, respectively, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. 64 PART II Item 8 Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2022 2021 2020 Balance, beginning of period $ 798 $ 816 $ 434 Charged to costs and other 157 234 560 Write-offs ( 245 ) ( 252 ) ( 178 ) Balance, end of period $ 710 $ 798 $ 816 Allowance for doubtful accounts included in our consolidated balance sheets: (In millions) June 30, 2022 2021 2020 Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts $ 633 $ 751 $ 788 Other long-term assets 77 47 28 Total $ 710 $ 798 $ 816 We record financing receivables when we offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products and services offerings through a financing program in a limited number of countries. As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, our financing receivables, net were $ 4.1 billion and $ 4.4 billion, respectively, for short-term and long-term financing receivables, which are included in other current assets and other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. We record an allowance to cover expected losses based on troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer We recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be capitalized. Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were immaterial during the periods presented and are included in other current and long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. We apply a practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs include our internal sales force compensation program and certain partner sales incentive programs as we have determined annual compensation is commensurate with annual sales activities. Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on PCs sold by original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”), to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online advertising space; costs incurred to support and maintain online products and services, including datacenter costs and royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and the amortization of capitalized software development costs. Capitalized software development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the products. Product Warranty We provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary. 65 PART II Item 8 Research and Development Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to production. Once technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $ 1.5 billion, $ 1.5 billion, and $ 1.6 billion in fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Stock-Based Compensation Compensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance stock units (“PSUs”), is measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the related service or performance period. The fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. We measure the fair value of PSUs using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Compensation cost for RSUs is recognized using the straight-line method and for PSUs is recognized using the accelerated method. Compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase. Income Taxes Income tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. Certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. All deferred income taxes are classified as long-term in our consolidated balance sheets. Financial Instruments Investments We consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. 66 PART II Item 8 Debt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in fair value, excluding credit losses and impairments, are recorded in other comprehensive income . Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. To determine credit losses, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery , then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments (referred to as the measurement alternative). We perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. Changes in value are recorded in other income (expense), net. Derivatives Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), net with offsetting gains and losses on the hedged items. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in other income (expense), net with the corresponding hedged item. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net. For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net. Fair Value Measurements We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are: • Level 1 – inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Our Level 1 investments include U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges. • Level 2 – inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies. Our Level 2 investments include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities include certain over-the-counter forward, option, and swap contracts. 67 PART II Item 8 • Level 3 – inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level 3 assets and liabilities include investments in corporate notes and bonds , municipal securities , and goodwill and intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge. Unobservable inputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities. We measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis. The fair values of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. Our other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. Inventories Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use, three to seven years ; computer equipment, two to four years ; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years ; leasehold improvements, three to 20 years ; and furniture and equipment, one to 10 years . Land is not depreciated. Leases We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. For certain equipment leases, such as vehicles, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. Additionally, for certain equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU assets and liabilities. Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. 68 PART II Item 8 Intangible Assets Our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from one to 20 years . We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired. Recent Accounting Guidance Accounting for Income Taxes In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new standard to simplify the accounting for income taxes. The guidance eliminates certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences related to changes in ownership of equity method investments and foreign subsidiaries. The guidance also simplifies aspects of accounting for franchise taxes and enacted changes in tax laws or rates and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. We adopted the standard effective July 1, 2021. Adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. NOTE 2 — EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards. The components of basic and diluted EPS were as follows: (In millions, except earnings per share) Year Ended June 30, 2022 2021 2020 Net income available for common shareholders (A) $ 72,738 $ 61,271 $ 44,281 Weighted average outstanding shares of common stock (B) 7,496 7,547 7,610 Dilutive effect of stock-based awards 44 61 73 Common stock and common stock equivalents (C) 7,540 7,608 7,683 Earnings Per Share Basic (A/B) $ 9.70 $ 8.12 $ 5.82 Diluted (A/C) $ 9.65 $ 8.05 $ 5.76 Anti-dilutive stock-based awards excluded from the calculations of diluted EPS were immaterial during the periods presented.

Equity investments presented as “Other” in the tables above include investments without readily determinable fair values measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments, and investments measured at fair value using net asset value as a practical expedient which are not categorized in the fair value hierarchy. As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, equity investments without readily determinable fair values measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments were $ 3.8 billion and $ 3.3 billion, respectively.

Our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. Our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Foreign Currencies Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. Foreign currency risks related to certain non-U.S. dollar-denominated investments are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair value hedging instruments. Foreign currency risks related to certain Euro-denominated debt are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. Certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign exchange rates on certain balance sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures. Interest Rate Interest rate risks related to certain fixed-rate debt are hedged using interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedging instruments to effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates. 73 PART II Item 8 Securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We manage the average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using exchange-traded option and futures contracts and over-the-counter swap and option contracts . These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in “Other contracts” in the tables below. Equity Securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to market price risk. At times, we may hold options, futures, and swap contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in “Other contracts” in the tables below. Credit Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We use credit default swap contracts to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in “Other contracts” in the tables below. Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features Certain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum liquidity of $ 1.0 billion. To the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to the standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. As of June 30, 2022, our long-term unsecured debt rating was AAA , and cash investments were in excess of $ 1.0 billion. As a result, no collateral was required to be posted.

The measurement periods for the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed end as soon as information on the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition dates becomes available, but do not exceed 12 months. Adjustments in purchase price allocations may require a change in the amounts allocated to goodwill during the periods in which the adjustments are determined. Any change in the goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency translations and purchase accounting adjustments are presented as “Other” in the table above. Also included in “Other” are business dispositions and transfers between segments due to reorganizations, as applicable. Goodwill Impairment We test goodwill for impairment annually on May 1 at the reporting unit level, primarily using a discounted cash flow methodology with a peer-based, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. We believe use of a discounted cash flow approach is the most reliable indicator of the fair values of the businesses. No instances of impairment were identified in our May 1, 2022, May 1, 2021, or May 1, 2020 tests. As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, accumulated goodwill impairment was $ 11.3 billion.

As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, the estimated fair value of long-term debt, including the current portion, was $ 50.9 billion and $ 70.0 billion, respectively. The estimated fair values are based on Level 2 inputs. Debt in the table above is comprised of senior unsecured obligations and ranks equally with our other outstanding obligations. Interest is paid semi-annually, except for the Euro-denominated debt, which is paid annually. Cash paid for interest on our debt for fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $ 1.9 billion, $ 2.0 billion, and $ 2.4 billion, respectively . The following table outlines maturities of our long-term debt, including the current portion, as of June 30, 2022: (In millions) Year Ending June 30, 2023 $ 2,750 2024 5,250 2025 2,250 2026 3,000 2027 8,000 Thereafter 34,261 Total $ 55,511 81 PART II Item 8 NOTE 12 — INCOME TAXES Provision for Income Taxes The components of the provision for income taxes were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2022 2021 2020 Current Taxes U.S. federal $ 8,329 $ 3,285 $ 3,537 U.S. state and local 1,679 1,229 763 Foreign 6,672 5,467 4,444 Current taxes $ 16,680 $ 9,981 $ 8,744 Deferred Taxes U.S. federal $ ( 4,815 ) $ 25 $ 58 U.S. state and local ( 1,062 ) ( 204 ) ( 6 ) Foreign 175 29 ( 41 ) Deferred taxes $ ( 5,702 ) $ ( 150 ) $ 11 Provision for income taxes $ 10,978 $ 9,831 $ 8,755 U.S. and foreign components of income before income taxes were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2022 2021 2020 U.S. $ 47,837 $ 34,972 $ 24,116 Foreign 35,879 36,130 28,920 Income before income taxes $ 83,716 $ 71,102 $ 53,036 Effective Tax Rate The items accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the U.S. federal statutory rate and our effective rate were as follows: Year Ended June 30, 2022 2021 2020 Federal statutory rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 % Effect of: Foreign earnings taxed at lower rates ( 1.3 ) % ( 2.7 ) % ( 3.7 ) % Impact of intangible property transfers ( 3.9 ) % 0 % 0 % Foreign-derived intangible income deduction ( 1.1 ) % ( 1.3 ) % ( 1.1 ) % State income taxes, net of federal benefit 1.4 % 1.4 % 1.3 % Research and development credit ( 0.9 ) % ( 0.9 ) % ( 1.1 ) % Excess tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation ( 1.9 ) % ( 2.4 ) % ( 2.2 ) % Interest, net 0.5 % 0.5 % 1.0 % Other reconciling items, net ( 0.7 ) % ( 1.8 ) % 1.3 % Effective rate 13.1 % 13.8 % 16.5 % In the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we transferred certain intangible properties from our Puerto Rico subsidiary to the U.S. The transfer of intangible properties resulted in a $ 3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, as the value of future U.S. tax deductions exceeds the current tax liability from the U.S. global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) tax. 82 PART II Item 8 We have historically paid India withholding taxes on software sales through distributor withholding and tax audit assessments in India. In March 2021, the India Supreme Court ruled favorably in the case of Engineering Analysis Centre of Excellence Private Limited vs The Commissioner of Income Tax for companies in 86 separate appeals, some dating back to 2012, holding that software sales are not subject to India withholding taxes. Although we were not a party to the appeals, our software sales in India were determined to be not subject to withholding taxes. Therefore, we recorded a net income tax benefit of $ 620 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 to reflect the results of the India Supreme Court decision impacting fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2016 . The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2022 is primarily due to the net income tax benefit related to the transfer of intangible properties, earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland, and tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2021 is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland and Puerto Rico, tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation, and tax benefits from the India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes. The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2020 is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland and Puerto Rico, and tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. In fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, our foreign regional operating centers in Ireland and Puerto Rico, which are taxed at rates lower than the U.S. rate, generated 71 %, 82 %, and 86 % of our foreign income before tax. Other reconciling items, net consists primarily of tax credits and GILTI tax, and in fiscal year 2021, includes tax benefits from the India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes. In fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, there were no individually significant other reconciling items. The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to a $ 3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer of intangible properties, offset in part by changes in the mix of our income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries, as well as tax benefits in the prior year from the India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes, an agreement between the U.S. and India tax authorities related to transfer pricing, and final Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) regulations. The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to tax benefits from the India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes, an agreement between the U.S. and India tax authorities related to transfer pricing, final TCJA regulations, and an increase in tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. 83 PART II Item 8 The components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows: (In millions) June 30, 2022 2021 Deferred Income Tax Assets Stock-based compensation expense $ 601 $ 502 Accruals, reserves, and other expenses 2,874 2,960 Loss and credit carryforwards 1,546 1,090 Amortization 10,656 6,346 Leasing liabilities 4,557 4,060 Unearned revenue 2,876 2,659 Other 461 319 Deferred income tax assets 23,571 17,936 Less valuation allowance ( 1,012 ) ( 769 ) Deferred income tax assets, net of valuation allowance $ 22,559 $ 17,167 Deferred Income Tax Liabilities Book/tax basis differences in investments and debt $ ( 174 ) $ ( 2,381 ) Leasing assets ( 4,291 ) ( 3,834 ) Depreciation ( 1,602 ) ( 1,010 ) Deferred tax on foreign earnings ( 3,104 ) ( 2,815 ) Other ( 103 ) ( 144 ) Deferred income tax liabilities $ ( 9,274 ) $ ( 10,184 ) Net deferred income tax assets $ 13,285 $ 6,983 Reported As Other long-term assets $ 13,515 $ 7,181 Long-term deferred income tax liabilities ( 230 ) ( 198 ) Net deferred income tax assets $ 13,285 $ 6,983 Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are paid or recovered. As of June 30, 2022, we had federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 318 million, $ 1.3 billion, and $ 2.1 billion, respectively. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in various years from fiscal 2023 through 2042 , if not utilized. The majority of our foreign net operating loss carryforwards do not expire. Certain acquired net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation but are expected to be realized with the exception of those which have a valuation allowance. As of June 30, 2022, we had $ 1.3 billion federal capital loss carryforwards for U.S. tax purposes from our acquisition of Nuance. The federal capital loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation and will expire in various years from fiscal 2023 through 2025 . The valuation allowance disclosed in the table above relates to the foreign net operating loss carryforwards, federal capital loss carryforwards, and other net deferred tax assets that may not be realized. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, were $ 16.0 billion, $ 13.4 billion, and $ 12.5 billion in fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Uncertain Tax Positions Gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions as of June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, were $ 15.6 billion, $ 14.6 billion, and $ 13.8 billion, respectively, which were primarily included in long-term income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets. If recognized, the resulting tax benefit would affect our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020 by $ 13.3 billion, $ 12.5 billion, and $ 12.1 billion, respectively. 84 PART II Item 8 As of June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we had accrued interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $ 4.3 billion, $ 4.3 billion, and $ 4.0 billion, respectively, net of income tax benefits. The provision for income taxes for fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020 included interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $ 36 million, $ 274 million, and $ 579 million, respectively, net of income tax benefits. The aggregate changes in the gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2022 2021 2020 Beginning unrecognized tax benefits $ 14,550 $ 13,792 $ 13,146 Decreases related to settlements ( 317 ) ( 195 ) ( 31 ) Increases for tax positions related to the current year 1,145 790 647 Increases for tax positions related to prior years 461 461 366 Decreases for tax positions related to prior years ( 246 ) ( 297 ) ( 331 ) Decreases due to lapsed statutes of limitations 0 ( 1 ) ( 5 ) Ending unrecognized tax benefits $ 15,593 $ 14,550 $ 13,792 We settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011. In February 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. We also settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in fiscal year 2016, and a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we settled an additional portion of the IRS audits for tax years 2004 to 2013 and made a payment of $ 1.7 billion, including tax and interest. We remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2017 . As of June 30, 2022, the primary unresolved issues for the IRS audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have a material impact in our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved. We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved key transfer pricing issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2021 , some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.

These operating and finance leases will commence between fiscal year 2023 and fiscal year 2028 with lease terms of 1 year to 18 years . 87 PART II Item 8 NOTE 15 — CONTINGENCIES Antitrust Litigation and Claims China State Administration for Market Regulation Investigatio n In 2014, Microsoft was informed that China’s State Agency for Market Regulation (“SAMR”) (formerly State Administration for Industry and Commerce) had begun a formal investigation relating to China’s Anti-Monopoly Law, and the SAMR conducted onsite inspections of Microsoft offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chengdu. In 2019, the SAMR presented preliminary views as to certain possible violations of China’s Anti-Monopoly Law. Product-Related Litigation U.S. Cell Phone Litigation Microsoft Mobile Oy, a subsidiary of Microsoft, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in 46 lawsuits, including 45 lawsuits filed in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and other adverse health effects. We assumed responsibility for these claims in our agreement to acquire Nokia’s Devices and Services business and have been substituted for the Nokia defendants. Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the U.S. Federal Communications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines (“FCC Guidelines”) are pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines. In 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plaintiffs’ expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed scientific methodologies. In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motion to exclude the plaintiffs’ general causation experts. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence. In October 2016, the Court of Appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases to the trial court for further proceedings under that standard. The plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which the defendants have moved to strike. In August 2018, the trial court issued an order striking portions of the plaintiffs’ expert reports. A hearing on general causation is scheduled for September of 2022 . Other Contingencies We also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. As of June 30, 2022, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $ 364 million. While we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $ 600 million in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable. 88 PART II Item 8 NOTE 16 — STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY Shares Outstanding Shares of common stock outstanding were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2022 2021 2020 Balance, beginning of year 7,519 7,571 7,643 Issued 40 49 54 Repurchased ( 95 ) ( 101 ) ( 126 ) Balance, end of year 7,464 7,519 7,571 Share Repurchases On September 20, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $ 40.0 billion in share repurchases.

Under the terms of the ESPP that were approved in 2012, the plan was set to terminate on December 31, 2022. At our 2021 Annual Shareholders Meeting, our shareholders approved a successor ESPP with a January 1, 2022 effective date and ten-year expiration of December 31, 2031.

NOTE 19 — SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA In its operation of the business, management, including our chief operating decision maker, who is also our Chief Executive Officer, reviews certain financial information, including segmented internal profit and loss statements prepared on a basis not consistent with GAAP. During the periods presented, we reported our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing. Our reportable segments are described below. Productivity and Business Processes Our Productivity and Business Processes segment consists of products and services in our portfolio of productivity, communication, and information services, spanning a variety of devices and platforms. This segment primarily comprises: • Office Commercial (Office 365 subscriptions, the Office 365 portion of Microsoft 365 Commercial subscriptions, and Office licensed on-premises), comprising Office, Exchange, SharePoint, Microsoft Teams, Office 365 Security and Compliance, and Microsoft Viva. • Office Consumer, including Microsoft 365 Consumer subscriptions, Office licensed on-premises, and other Office services. • LinkedIn, including Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, Premium Subscriptions, and Sales Solutions. • Dynamics business solutions, including Dynamics 365, comprising a set of intelligent, cloud-based applications across ERP, CRM, Customer Insights, Power Apps, and Power Automate; and on-premises ERP and CRM applications. Intelligent Cloud Our Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, private, and hybrid server products and cloud services that can power modern business and developers. This segment primarily comprises: • Server products and cloud services, including Azure and other cloud services; SQL Server, Windows Server, Visual Studio, System Center, and related Client Access Licenses (“CALs”); and Nuance and GitHub. • Enterprise Services, including Enterprise Support Services, Microsoft Consulting Services, and Nuance professional services. More Personal Computing Our More Personal Computing segment consists of products and services that put customers at the center of the experience with our technology. This segment primarily comprises: • Windows, including Windows OEM licensing and other non-volume licensing of the Windows operating system; Windows Commercial, comprising volume licensing of the Windows operating system, Windows cloud services, and other Windows commercial offerings; patent licensing; and Windows Internet of Things. • Devices, including Surface and PC accessories. • Gaming, including Xbox hardware and Xbox content and services, comprising first- and third-party content (including games and in-game content), Xbox Game Pass and other subscriptions, Xbox Cloud Gaming, third-party disc royalties, advertising, and other cloud services. • Search and news advertising. 93 PART II Item 8 Revenue and costs are generally directly attributed to our segments. However, due to the integrated structure of our business, certain revenue recognized and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. Revenue from certain contracts is allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services, which can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit margin. Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative revenue methodology. Operating expenses that are allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple segments benefit and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin. In addition, certain costs incurred at a corporate level that are identifiable and that benefit our segments are allocated to them. These allocated costs include legal, including settlements and fines, information technology, human resources, finance, excise taxes, field selling, shared facilities services, and customer service and support. Each allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs being allocated. Segment revenue and operating income were as follows during the periods presented: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2022 2021 2020 Revenue Productivity and Business Processes $ 63,364 $ 53,915 $ 46,398 Intelligent Cloud 75,251 60,080 48,366 More Personal Computing 59,655 54,093 48,251 Total $ 198,270 $ 168,088 $ 143,015 Operating Income Productivity and Business Processes $ 29,687 $ 24,351 $ 18,724 Intelligent Cloud 32,721 26,126 18,324 More Personal Computing 20,975 19,439 15,911 Total $ 83,383 $ 69,916 $ 52,959 No sales to an individual customer or country other than the United States accounted for more than 10% of revenue for fiscal years 2022, 2021, or 2020. Revenue, classified by the major geographic areas in which our customers were located, was as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2022 2021 2020 United States (a) $ 100,218 $ 83,953 $ 73,160 Other countries 98,052 84,135 69,855 Total $ 198,270 $ 168,088 $ 143,015 (a) Includes billings to OEMs and certain multinational organizations because of the nature of these businesses and the impracticability of determining the geographic source of the revenue. 94 PART II Item 8 Revenue, classified by significant product and service offerings, was as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2022 2021 2020 Server products and cloud services $ 67,321 $ 52,589 $ 41,379 Office products and cloud services 44,862 39,872 35,316 Windows 24,761 22,488 21,510 Gaming 16,230 15,370 11,575 LinkedIn 13,816 10,289 8,077 Search and news advertising 11,591 9,267 8,524 Enterprise Services 7,407 6,943 6,409 Devices 6,991 6,791 6,457 Other 5,291 4,479 3,768 Total $ 198,270 $ 168,088 $ 143,015 We have recast certain previously reported amounts in the table above to conform to the way we internally manage and monitor our business. Our Microsoft Cloud (formerly commercial cloud) revenue, which includes Azure and other cloud services, Office 365 Commercial, the commercial portion of LinkedIn, Dynamics 365, and other commercial cloud properties, was $ 91.2 billion, $ 69.1 billion and $ 51.7 billion in fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. These amounts are primarily included in Server products and cloud services, Office products and cloud services, and LinkedIn in the table above. Assets are not allocated to segments for internal reporting presentations. A portion of amortization and depreciation is included with various other costs in an overhead allocation to each segment. It is impracticable for us to separately identify the amount of amortization and depreciation by segment that is included in the measure of segment profit or loss. Long-lived assets, excluding financial instruments and tax assets, classified by the location of the controlling statutory company and with countries over 10% of the total shown separately, were as follows: (In millions) June 30, 2022 2021 2020 United States $ 106,430 $ 76,153 $ 60,789 Ireland 15,505 13,303 12,734 Other countries 44,433 38,858 29,770 Total $ 166,368 $ 128,314 $ 103,293 95 PART II Item 8 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Microsoft Corporation Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries (the ""Company"") as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders' equity, for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the ""financial statements""). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated July 28, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 96 PART II Item 8 Revenue Recognition – Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. The Company offers customers the ability to acquire multiple licenses of software products and services, including cloud-based services, in its customer agreements through its volume licensing programs. Significant judgment is exercised by the Company in determining revenue recognition for these customer agreements, and includes the following: • Determination of whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together, such as software licenses and related services that are sold with cloud-based services. • The pattern of delivery (i.e., timing of when revenue is recognized) for each distinct performance obligation. • Identification and treatment of contract terms that may impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized (e.g., variable consideration, optional purchases, and free services). • Determination of stand-alone selling prices for each distinct performance obligation and for products and services that are not sold separately. Given these factors and due to the volume of transactions, the related audit effort in evaluating management's judgments in determining revenue recognition for these customer agreements was extensive and required a high degree of auditor judgment. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our principal audit procedures related to the Company's revenue recognition for these customer agreements included the following: • We tested the effectiveness of controls related to the identification of distinct performance obligations, the determination of the timing of revenue recognition, and the estimation of variable consideration. • We evaluated management's significant accounting policies related to these customer agreements for reasonableness. • We selected a sample of customer agreements and performed the following procedures: - Obtained and read contract source documents for each selection, including master agreements, and other documents that were part of the agreement. - Tested management's identification and treatment of contract terms. - Assessed the terms in the customer agreement and evaluated the appropriateness of management's application of their accounting policies, along with their use of estimates, in the determination of revenue recognition conclusions. • We evaluated the reasonableness of management's estimate of stand-alone selling prices for products and services that are not sold separately. • We tested the mathematical accuracy of management's calculations of revenue and the associated timing of revenue recognized in the financial statements. 97 PART II Item 8 Income Taxes – Uncertain Tax Positions – Refer to Note 12 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company's long-term income taxes liability includes uncertain tax positions related to transfer pricing issues that remain unresolved with the Internal Revenue Service (""IRS""). The Company remains under IRS audit, or subject to IRS audit, for tax years subsequent to 2003. While the Company has settled a portion of the IRS audits, resolution of the remaining matters could have a material impact on the Company's financial statements. Conclusions on recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions involve significant estimates and management judgment and include complex considerations of the Internal Revenue Code, related regulations, tax case laws, and prior-year audit settlements. Given the complexity and the subjective nature of the transfer pricing issues that remain unresolved with the IRS, evaluating management's estimates relating to their determination of uncertain tax positions required extensive audit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment, including involvement of our tax specialists. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our principal audit procedures to evaluate management's estimates of uncertain tax positions related to unresolved transfer pricing issues included the following: • We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management's methods and assumptions used in the identification, recognition, measurement, and disclosure of uncertain tax positions, which included testing the effectiveness of the related internal controls. • We read and evaluated management's documentation, including relevant accounting policies and information obtained by management from outside tax specialists, that detailed the basis of the uncertain tax positions. • We tested the reasonableness of management's judgments regarding the future resolution of the uncertain tax positions, including an evaluation of the technical merits of the uncertain tax positions. • For those uncertain tax positions that had not been effectively settled, we evaluated whether management had appropriately considered new information that could significantly change the recognition, measurement or disclosure of the uncertain tax positions. • We evaluated the reasonableness of management's estimates by considering how tax law, including statutes, regulations and case law, impacted management's judgments. /s/ D ELOITTE & T OUCHE LLP Seattle, Washington July 28, 2022 We have served as the Company's auditor since 1983. 98 PART II Item 9, 9A ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE Not applicable. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective. REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our consolidated financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected. Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2022. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Deloitte & Touche LLP has audited our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022; their report is included in Item 9A. 99 PART II Item 9A REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Microsoft Corporation Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries (the ""Company"") as of June 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2022, of the Company and our report dated July 28, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ D ELOITTE & T OUCHE LLP Seattle, Washington July 28, 2022 100 PART II, III Item 9B, 9C, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 ITEM 9B.

BUSINESS GENERAL Embracing Our Future Microsoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. We strive to create local opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world. Our platforms and tools help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness, and public-sector efficiency. They also support new startups, improve educational and health outcomes, and empower human ingenuity. We bring technology and products together into experiences and solutions that unlock value for our customers. Our ecosystem of customers and partners has stepped up to help people and organizations in every country use technology to be resilient and transform during the most trying of circumstances. Amid rapid change we’ve witnessed technology empower telehealth, remote manufacturing, and new ways of working from home and serving customers. These capabilities have relied on the public cloud, which is built on the investments we have made over time. We are living in the new era of the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge, which is being sharpened by rapid advances in distributed computing, ambient intelligence, and multidevice experiences. This means the places we go and the things we interact with will increasingly become digitized, creating new opportunities and new breakthroughs. In the next phase of innovation, computing is more powerful and ubiquitous from the cloud to the edge. Artificial intelligence (“AI”) capabilities are rapidly advancing, fueled by data and knowledge of the world. Physical and virtual worlds are coming together with the Internet of Things (“IoT”) and mixed reality to create richer experiences that understand the context surrounding people, the things they use, the places they go, and their activities and relationships. A person’s experience with technology spans a multitude of devices and has become increasingly more natural and multi-sensory with voice, ink, and gaze interactions. What We Offer Founded in 1975, we develop and support software, services, devices, and solutions that deliver new value for customers and help people and businesses realize their full potential. We offer an array of services, including cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content, and we provide solution support and consulting services. We also deliver relevant online advertising to a global audience. Our products include operating systems, cross-device productivity applications, server applications, business solution applications, desktop and server management tools, software development tools, and video games. We also design and sell devices, including PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories. 3 PART I Item 1 The Ambitions That Drive Us To achieve our vision, our research and development efforts focus on three interconnected ambitions: • Reinvent productivity and business processes. • Build the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge platform. • Create more personal computing. Reinvent Productivity and Business Processes At Microsoft, we’re providing technology and resources to help our customers navigate a remote environment. We’re seeing our family of products play key roles in the ways the world is continuing to work, learn, and connect. Our growth depends on securely delivering continuous innovation and advancing our leading productivity and collaboration tools and services, including Office, Dynamics, and LinkedIn. Microsoft 365 brings together Office 365, Windows, and Enterprise Mobility + Security to help organizations empower their employees with AI-backed tools that unlock creativity, increase teamwork, and fuel innovation, all the while enabling compliance coverage and data protection. Microsoft Teams is enabling rapid digital transformation by giving people a single tool to chat, call, meet, and collaborate. Microsoft Viva is an employee experience platform that brings together communications, knowledge, learning, resources, and insights powered by Microsoft 365. Microsoft Relationship Sales solution brings together LinkedIn Sales Navigator and Dynamics to transform business to business sales through social selling. Dynamics 365 for Talent with LinkedIn Recruiter and Learning gives human resource professionals a complete solution to compete for talent. Microsoft Power Platform empowers employees to build custom applications, automate workflow, and analyze data no matter their technical expertise. These scenarios represent a move to unlock creativity and discover new habits, while simplifying security and management. Organizations of all sizes have digitized business-critical functions, redefining what they can expect from their business applications. This creates an opportunity to reach new customers and increase usage and engagement with existing customers. Build the Intelligent Cloud and Intelligent Edge Platform In the new remote world, companies have accelerated their own digital transformation to empower their employees, optimize their operations, engage customers, and in some cases, change the very core of their products and services. Partnering with organizations on their digital transformation during this period is one of our largest opportunities and we are uniquely positioned to become the strategic digital transformation platform and partner of choice; their success is our success. Our strategy requires continued investment in datacenters and other hybrid and edge infrastructure to support our services. Azure is a trusted cloud with comprehensive compliance coverage and AI-based security built in. Our cloud business benefits from three economies of scale: datacenters that deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones; datacenters that coordinate and aggregate diverse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns, improving the utilization of computing, storage, and network resources; and multi-tenancy locations that lower application maintenance labor costs. The Microsoft Cloud is the most comprehensive and trusted cloud, providing the best integration across the technology stack while offering openness, improving time to value, reducing costs, and increasing agility. Being a global-scale cloud, Azure uniquely offers hybrid consistency, developer productivity, AI capabilities, and trusted security and compliance. We see more emerging use cases and needs for compute and security at the edge and are accelerating our innovation across the spectrum of intelligent edge devices, from IoT sensors to gateway devices and edge hardware to build, manage, and secure edge workloads. With Azure Stack, organizations can extend Azure into their own datacenters to create a consistent stack across the public cloud and the intelligent edge. Our hybrid infrastructure consistency spans security, compliance, identity, and management, helping to support the real-world needs and evolving regulatory requirements of commercial customers and enterprises. Azure Arc simplifies governance and management by delivering a consistent multi-cloud and on-premises management platform. Security, compliance, identity, and management underlie our entire tech stack. We offer integrated, end-to-end capabilities to protect people and organizations. In April 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Nuance Communications, Inc., a cloud and AI software provider with healthcare and enterprise AI experience. The acquisition will build on our industry-specific cloud offerings. 4 PART I Item 1 We are accelerating our development of mixed reality solutions with new Azure services and devices. Microsoft Mesh enables presence and shared experiences from anywhere through mixed reality applications. The opportunity to merge the physical and digital worlds, when combined with the power of Azure cloud services, unlocks the potential for entirely new workloads and experiences which we believe will shape the next era of computing. The ability to convert data into AI drives our competitive advantage. Azure SQL Database makes it possible for customers to take SQL Server from their on-premises datacenter to a fully managed instance in the cloud to utilize built-in AI. Azure Synapse Analytics, a limitless analytics service, brings together data integration, enterprise data warehousing, and big data analytics for immediate business intelligence and machine learning needs. We are accelerating adoption of AI innovations from research to products. Our innovation helps every developer be an AI developer, with approachable new tools from Azure Machine Learning Studio for creating simple machine learning models, to the powerful Azure Machine Learning Workbench for the most advanced AI modeling and data science. From GitHub to Visual Studio, we provide a developer tool chain for everyone, no matter the technical experience, across all platforms, whether Azure, Windows, or any other cloud or client platform. Create More Personal Computing We strive to make computing more personal by putting people at the core of the experience, enabling them to interact with technology in more intuitive, engaging, and dynamic ways. Microsoft 365 is empowering people and organizations to be productive and secure as they adapt to more fluid ways of working and learning. The PC has been mission-critical across work, school, and life to sustain productivity in a remote everything world. Windows 10 serves the enterprise as the most secure and productive operating system. It empowers people with AI-first interfaces ranging from voice-activated commands through Cortana, inking, immersive 3D content storytelling, and mixed reality experiences. Our ambition for Windows 10 monetization opportunities includes gaming, services, subscriptions, and search advertising. In June 2021, Microsoft announced the next generation of Windows – Windows 11. Windows 11 builds on the strengths of productivity, versatility, and security on Windows 10 today and adds in new experiences that include powerful task switching tools like new snap layouts, snap groups, and desktops; new ways to stay connected through chat; the information you want at your fingertips; and more. Windows also plays a critical role in fueling our cloud business and Microsoft 365 strategy, and it powers the growing range of devices on the “intelligent edge.” Microsoft Edge is our fast and secure browser that helps protect your data, with built-in shopping tools designed to save you time and money. Organizational tools such as Collections, Vertical Tabs, and Immersive Reader help you make the most of your time while browsing, streaming, searching, sharing, and more. We are committed to designing and marketing first-party devices to help drive innovation, create new device categories, and stimulate demand in the Windows ecosystem. The Surface family includes Surface Book 3, Surface Laptop Go, Surface Go 2, Surface Pro 7, Surface Laptop 4, Surface Pro X, Surface Studio 2, and Surface Duo. To expand usage and deepen engagement, we continue to invest in content, community, and cloud services as we pursue the expansive opportunity in the gaming industry. We have broadened our approach to how we think about gaming end-to-end, from the way games are created and distributed to how they are played, including cloud gaming so players can stream across PC, console, and mobile. We have a strong position with our large and growing highly engaged community of gamers, including the March 2021 acquisition of ZeniMax Media Inc., the parent company of Bethesda Softworks LLC, one of the largest, privately held game developers and publishers in the world. Xbox Game Pass is a community with access to a curated library of over 100 first- and third-party console and PC titles. Xbox Cloud Gaming is Microsoft’s game streaming technology that is complementary to our console hardware and gives fans the ultimate choice to play the games they want, with the people they want, on the devices they want. 5 PART I Item 1 Our Future Opportunity In a time of great disruption and uncertainty, customers are looking to us to accelerate their own digital transformations as software and cloud computing play a huge role across every industry and around the world. We continue to develop complete, intelligent solutions for our customers that empower people to stay productive and collaborate, while safeguarding businesses and simplifying IT management. Our goal is to lead the industry in several distinct areas of technology over the long-term, which we expect will translate to sustained growth. We are investing significant resources in: • Transforming the workplace to deliver new modern, modular business applications to improve how people communicate, collaborate, learn, work, play, and interact with one another. • Building and running cloud-based services in ways that unleash new experiences and opportunities for businesses and individuals. • Applying AI to drive insights and act on our customer’s behalf by understanding and interpreting their needs using natural methods of communication. • Using Windows to fuel our cloud business, grow our share of the PC market, and drive increased engagement with our services like Microsoft 365 Consumer, Teams, Edge, Bing, Xbox Game Pass , and more. • Tackling security from all angles with our integrated, end-to-end solutions spanning security, compliance, identity, and management, across all clouds and platforms. • Inventing new gaming experiences that bring people together around their shared love for games on any devices and pushing the boundaries of innovation with console and PC gaming by creating the next wave of entertainment. Our future growth depends on our ability to transcend current product category definitions, business models, and sales motions. We have the opportunity to redefine what customers and partners can expect and are working to deliver new solutions that reflect the best of Microsoft. COVID-19 In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 to be a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have widespread and unpredictable impacts on global society, economies, financial markets, and business practices, and continues to impact our business operations, including our employees, customers, partners, and communities. Refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion regarding the impact of COVID-19 on our fiscal year 2021 financial results. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business going forward will depend on numerous evolving factors we cannot reliably predict. Refer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) for a discussion of these factors and other risks. Corporate Social Responsibility Commitment to Sustainability We work to ensure that technology is inclusive, trusted, and increases sustainability. We are accelerating progress toward a more sustainable future by reducing our environmental footprint, advancing research, helping our customers build sustainable solutions, and advocating for policies that benefit the environment. In January 2020, we announced a bold commitment and detailed plan to be carbon negative by 2030, and to remove from the environment by 2050 all the carbon we have emitted since our founding in 1975. This included a commitment to invest $1 billion over four years in new technologies and innovative climate solutions. We built on this pledge by adding commitments to be water positive by 2030, zero waste by 2030, and to protect ecosystems by developing a Planetary Computer. We also help our suppliers and customers around the world use Microsoft technology to reduce their own carbon footprint. In January 2021, we announced that in fiscal year 2020 we reduced Microsoft’s carbon emissions by 586,683 metric tons. We purchased the removal of 1.3 million metric tons of carbon from 26 projects around the world. Furthermore, we shared a commitment to transparency by subjecting the data in our annual sustainability report to third-party review and to accountability by including progress on sustainability goals as a factor in determining executive pay. 6 PART I Item 1 The investments we make in sustainability carry through to our products, services, and devices. We design our devices, from Surface to Xbox, to minimize their impact on the environment . Our cloud and AI services and datacenters help businesses cut energy consumption, reduce physical footprints, and design sustainable products. We also pledged a $50 million investment in AI for Earth to accelerate innovation by putting AI in the hands of those working to directly address sustainability challenges. We are committed to playing our part to help accelerate the world’s transition to a more economically and environmentally sustainable future for us all . Addressing Racial Injustice and Inequity Our future opportunity depends on reaching and empowering all communities, and we are committed to taking action to help address racial injustice and inequity. With significant input from employees and leaders who are members of the Black and African American community, our senior leadership team and board of directors announced in June 2020 that we had developed a set of actions to help improve the lived experience at Microsoft and drive change in the communities in which we live and work. These efforts include increasing our representation and strengthening our culture of inclusion by doubling the number of Black and African American people managers, senior individual contributors, and senior leaders in the United States by 2025; evolving our ecosystem with our supply chain, banking partners, and partner ecosystem; and strengthening our communities by using data, technology, and partnerships to help address racial injustice and inequities of the Black and African American communities in the U.S. and improve the safety and wellbeing of our employees and their communities. Over the last year, we have collaborated with partners and worked within neighborhoods and communities to launch and scale a number of projects and programs including: expanding our existing justice reform work with a five-year, $50 million sustained effort, expanding access to affordable broadband and devices for Black and African American communities and key institutions that support them in major urban centers, expanding access to skills and education to support Black and African American students and adults to succeed in the digital economy, and increasing technology support for nonprofits that provide critical services to Black and African American communities. We have more than doubled our percentage share of transaction volume with Black- and African American-owned financial institutions and increased our deposits with Black- and African American-owned minority depository institutions, enabling increased funds into local communities. Additionally, we have seen growth in our Black- and African American-owned supplier base and in Black- and African American-owned technology partners in the Microsoft Partner Network, and we launched the Black Channel Partner Alliance community to support partners onboarding to the Microsoft Cloud and to unlock partner benefits for co-selling with Microsoft. We acknowledge we have more work ahead of us to address racial injustice and inequity, and are applying many of the programs above to help other underrepresented communities. Investing in Digital Skills With a continued focus on digital transformation, Microsoft is helping to ensure that no one is left behind, particularly as economies recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. We announced in June 2020 that we are expanding access to the digital skills that have become increasingly vital to many of the world’s jobs, and especially to individuals hardest hit by recent job losses. Our skills initiative brings together learning resources, certification opportunities, and job-seeker tools from LinkedIn, GitHub, and Microsoft Learn, and is built on data insights drawn from LinkedIn’s Economic Graph. We also invested $20 million in key non-profit partnerships through Microsoft Philanthropies to help people from underserved communities that are often excluded by the digital economy. Over 42 million people across every continent have accessed free training through our skills initiative. The effort surpassed its initial goals and has been expanded with a new emphasis on connecting learners with jobs that help put their new training to use and connecting employers with skilled job seekers they might not find in traditional networks. 7 PART I Item 1 HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES Overview Microsoft aims to recruit, develop, and retain diverse, world-changing talent. To foster their and our success, we seek to create an environment where people can do their best work – a place where they can proudly be their authentic selves, guided by our values, and where they know their needs can be met. We strive to maximize the potential of our human capital resources by creating a respectful, rewarding, and inclusive work environment that enables our global employees to create products and services that further our mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. As of June 30, 2021, we employed approximately 181,000 people on a full-time basis, 103,000 in the U.S. and 78,000 internationally. Of the total employed people, 67,000 were in operations, including manufacturing, distribution, product support, and consulting services; 60,000 were in product research and development; 40,000 were in sales and marketing; and 14,000 were in general and administration. Certain of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Our Culture Microsoft’s culture is grounded in the growth mindset. This means everyone is on a continuous journey to learn and grow. We believe potential can be nurtured and is not pre-determined, and we should always be learning and curious - trying new things without fear of failure. We identified four attributes that allow growth mindset to flourish: • Obsessing over what matters to our customers. • Becoming more diverse and inclusive in everything we do. • Operating as one company, One Microsoft, instead of multiple siloed businesses. • Making a difference in the lives of each other, our customers, and the world around us. Our employee listening systems enable us to gather feedback directly from our workforce to inform our programs and employee needs globally. 88% of employees globally participated in our fiscal year 2021 MS Poll engagement survey, which covers a variety of topics such as inclusion, pay and benefits, and learning and development. Throughout the fiscal year, we also collect nearly 75,000 Daily Pulse employee survey responses. During fiscal year 2021, our Daily Pulse surveys gave us invaluable insights into ways we could support employees through the COVID-19 pandemic and addressing racial injustice. In addition to poll and pulse surveys, we gain insights through onboarding and exit surveys, internal Yammer channels, employee Q&A sessions, and AskHR Service support. Diversity and Inclusion At Microsoft we have an inherently inclusive mission: to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. We think of diversity and inclusion as core to our business model, informing our actions to impact economies and people around the world. There are billions of people who want to achieve more, but have a different set of circumstances, abilities, and backgrounds that often limit access to opportunity and achievement. The better we represent that diversity inside Microsoft, the more effectively we can innovate for those we seek to empower. We strive to include others by holding ourselves accountable for diversity, driving global systemic change in our workplace and workforce, and creating an inclusive work environment. Through this commitment we can allow everyone the chance to be their authentic selves and do their best work every day. We support multiple highly active Employee Resource Groups for women, families, racial and ethnic minorities, military, people with disabilities, or who identify as LGBTQI+, where employees can go for support, networking, and community-building. As described in our 2020 Proxy Statement , annual performance and compensation reviews of our senior leadership team include an evaluation of their contributions to employee culture and diversity. To ensure accountability over time, we publicly disclose our progress on a multitude of workforce metrics including: • Detailed breakdowns of gender, racial, and ethnic minority representation in our employee population, with data by job types, levels, and segments of our business. • Our EEO-1 report (equal employment opportunity). • Disability representation. 8 PART I Item 1 Total Rewards We develop dynamic, sustainable, and strategic programs with the goal of providing a highly differentiated portfolio to attract, reward, and retain top talent and enable our employees to do their best work. These programs reinforce our culture and values such as collaboration and growth mindset. Managers evaluate and recommend rewards based on, for example, how well we leverage the work of others and contribute to the success of our colleagues. We monitor pay equity and career progress across multiple dimensions. As part of our effort to promote a One Microsoft and inclusive culture, we expanded stock eligibility to all Microsoft employees as part of our annual rewards process. This includes all non-exempt and exempt employees and equivalents across the globe including business support professionals and datacenter and retail employees. Pay Equity In our 2020 Diversity and Inclusion Report, we reported that all racial and ethnic minority employees in the U.S. combined earn $1.006 for every $1.000 earned by their white counterparts, that women in the U.S. earn $1.001 for every $1.000 earned by their counterparts in the U.S. who are men, and women in the U.S. plus our ten other largest employee geographies (Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Israel, Japan, and United Kingdom) combined earn $1.000 for every $1.000 by men in these countries. Our intended result is a global performance and development approach that fosters our culture, and competitive compensation that ensures equitable pay by role while supporting pay for performance. Wellness and Safety Microsoft is committed to supporting our employees’ well-being and safety while they are at work and in their personal lives. We took a wide variety of measures to protect the health and well-being of our employees, suppliers, and customers during the COVID-19 pandemic. We made substantial modifications to employee travel policies and implemented office closures so non-essential employees could work remotely. We continued to pay hourly service providers such as cleaning and reception staff who may have otherwise been furloughed. We implemented a global Paid Pandemic School and Childcare Closure Leave to support working parents, added wellbeing days for those who needed to take time off for mental health and wellness, implemented on-demand COVID-19 testing and vaccinations on our Redmond, Washington campus, and extended full medical plan coverage for coronavirus testing, treatment, and telehealth services. We also expanded existing programs such as our Microsoft CARES Employee Assistance Program and family backup care. In addition to the extraordinary steps and programs relating to COVID-19, our comprehensive benefits package includes many physical, emotional, and financial wellness programs including counseling through the Microsoft CARES Employee Assistance Program, flexible fitness benefits, savings and investment tools, adoption assistance, and back-up care for children and elders. Finally, our Occupational Health and Safety program helps ensure employees can stay safe while they are working. Learning and Development Our growth mindset culture begins with valuing learning over knowing – seeking out new ideas, driving innovation, embracing challenges, learning from failure, and improving over time. To support this culture, we offer a wide range of learning and development opportunities. We believe learning can be more than formal instruction, and our learning philosophy focuses on providing the right learning, at the right time, in the right way. Opportunities include: • Personalized, integrated, and relevant views of all learning opportunities on our internal learning portal, our external learning portal MS Learn, and LinkedIn Learning that is available to all employees worldwide. • In-the-classroom learning, learning “pods,” our early-in-career Aspire program, and manager excellence communities. • On-the-job “stretch” and advancement opportunities. • Managers holding conversations about employees’ career and development plans, coaching on career opportunities, and programs like mentoring and sponsorship. • Customized manager learning to build people manager capabilities and similar learning solutions to build leadership skills for all employees including differentiated leadership development programs. 9 PART I Item 1 • New employee orientation covering a range of topics including company values, culture, and Standards of Business Conduct , as well as ongoing onboarding program . Our employees embrace the growth mindset and take advantage of the formal learning opportunities as well as thousands of informal and on-the-job learning opportunities. In terms of formal on-line learning solutions, in fiscal year 2021 our employees completed over 5 million courses, averaging over 18 hours per employee. Given our focus on understanding core company beliefs and compliance topics, all employees complete required learning programs like Standards of Business Conduct, Privacy, Unconscious Bias, and preventing harassment courses. Our corporate learning portal has over 100,000 average monthly active users. All of our approximately 23,000 people managers must complete between 25-30 hours of required manager capability and excellence training and are assigned ongoing required training each year. In addition, all employees complete skills training based on the profession they are in each year. New Ways of Working The global pandemic has accelerated our capabilities and culture with respect to flexible work. Microsoft has introduced a Hybrid Workplace Flexibility Guide to better support managers and employees as they adapt to new ways of working that shift paradigms, embrace flexibility, promote inclusion, and drive innovation. Our ongoing survey data shows employees value the flexibility related to work location, work site, and work hours, and while many indicate they intend to return to a worksite once conditions permit, they also intend to adjust hours or spend some portions of workweeks working remotely. We are focused on building capabilities to support a variety of workstyles where individuals, teams, and our business can be successful. OPERATING SEGMENTS We operate our business and report our financial performance using three segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing. Our segments provide management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. The segments enable the alignment of strategies and objectives across the development, sales, marketing, and services organizations, and they provide a framework for timely and rational allocation of resources within businesses. Additional information on our operating segments and geographic and product information is contained in Note 19 – Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). Our reportable segments are described below. Productivity and Business Processes Our Productivity and Business Processes segment consists of products and services in our portfolio of productivity, communication, and information services, spanning a variety of devices and platforms. This segment primarily comprises: • Office Commercial (Office 365 subscriptions, the Office 365 portion of Microsoft 365 Commercial subscriptions, and Office licensed on-premises), comprising Office, Exchange, SharePoint, Microsoft Teams, Office 365 Security and Compliance, and Skype for Business. • Office Consumer, including Microsoft 365 Consumer subscriptions and Office licensed on-premises, and Office Consumer Services, including Skype, Outlook.com, and OneDrive. • LinkedIn, including Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, Premium Subscriptions, Sales Solutions, and Learning Solutions. • Dynamics business solutions, including Dynamics 365, comprising a set of intelligent, cloud-based applications across ERP, CRM, Customer Insights, Power Apps, and Power Automate; and on-premises ERP and CRM applications. 10 PART I Item 1 Office Commercial Office Commercial is designed to increase personal, team, and organizational productivity through a range of products and services. Growth depends on our ability to reach new users in new markets such as frontline workers, small and medium businesses, and growth markets, as well as add value to our core product and service offerings to span productivity categories such as communication, collaboration, analytics, security, and compliance. Office Commercial revenue is mainly affected by a combination of continued installed base growth and average revenue per user expansion, as well as the continued shift from Office licensed on-premises to Office 365. Office Consumer Office Consumer is designed to increase personal productivity through a range of products and services. Growth depends on our ability to reach new users, add value to our core product set, and continue to expand our product and service offerings into new markets. Office Consumer revenue is mainly affected by the percentage of customers that buy Office with their new devices and the continued shift from Office licensed on-premises to Microsoft 365 Consumer subscriptions. Office Consumer Services revenue is mainly affected by the demand for communication and storage through Skype, Outlook.com, and OneDrive, which is largely driven by subscriptions, advertising, and the sale of minutes. LinkedIn LinkedIn connects the world’s professionals to make them more productive and successful and transforms the way companies hire, market, sell, and learn. Our vision is to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce through the ongoing development of the world’s first Economic Graph, a digital representation of the global economy. In addition to LinkedIn’s free services, LinkedIn offers monetized solutions: Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, Premium Subscriptions, Sales Solutions, and Learning Solutions. Talent Solutions provide insights for workforce planning and tools to hire, nurture, and develop talent. Marketing Solutions help companies reach, engage, and convert their audiences at scale. Premium Subscriptions enables professionals to manage their professional identity, grow their network, and connect with talent through additional services like premium search. Sales Solutions help companies strengthen customer relationships, empower teams with digital selling tools, and acquire new opportunities. Finally, Learning Solutions, including Glint, help businesses close critical skills gaps in times where companies are having to do more with existing talent. LinkedIn has over 750 million members and has offices around the globe. Growth will depend on our ability to increase the number of LinkedIn members and our ability to continue offering services that provide value for our members and increase their engagement. LinkedIn revenue is mainly affected by demand from enterprises and professional organizations for subscriptions to Talent Solutions , Learning Solutions, Sales Solutions, and Premium Subscriptions offerings, as well as member engagement and the quality of the sponsored content delivered to those members to drive Marketing Solutions. Dynamics Dynamics provides cloud-based and on-premises business solutions for financial management, enterprise resource planning (“ERP”), customer relationship management (“CRM”), supply chain management, and other application development platforms for small and medium businesses, large organizations, and divisions of global enterprises. Dynamics revenue is driven by the number of users licensed and applications consumed, expansion of average revenue per user, and the continued shift to Dynamics 365, a unified set of cloud-based intelligent business applications, including Power Apps and Power Automate. 11 PART I Item 1 Competition Competitors to Office include software and global application vendors, such as Apple, Cisco Systems, Facebook, Google, IBM, Okta, Proofpoint, Slack, Symantec, Zoom, and numerous web-based and mobile application competitors as well as local application developers.

Slack provides teamwork and collaboration software. Zoom offers videoconferencing and cloud phone solutions. Skype for Business and Skype also compete with a variety of instant messaging, voice, and video communication providers, ranging from start-ups to established enterprises. Okta, Proofpoint, and Symantec provide security solutions across email security, information protection, identity, and governance. Web-based offerings competing with individual applications have also positioned themselves as alternatives to our products and services. We compete by providing powerful, flexible, secure, integrated industry-specific, and easy-to-use productivity and collaboration tools and services that create comprehensive solutions and work well with technologies our customers already have both on-premises or in the cloud. LinkedIn faces competition from online professional networks, recruiting companies, talent management companies, and larger companies that are focusing on talent management and human resource services; job boards; traditional recruiting firms; and companies that provide learning and development products and services. Marketing Solutions competes with online and offline outlets that generate revenue from advertisers and marketers, and Sales Solutions competes with online and offline outlets for companies with lead generation and customer intelligence and insights. Dynamics competes with cloud-based and on-premises business solution providers such as Oracle, Salesforce.com, and SAP. Intelligent Cloud Our Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, private, and hybrid server products and cloud services that can power modern business and developers. This segment primarily comprises: • Server products and cloud services, including Azure; SQL Server, Windows Server, Visual Studio, System Center, and related Client Access Licenses (“CALs”); and GitHub. • Enterprise Services, including Premier Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services. Server Products and Cloud Services Azure is a comprehensive set of cloud services that offer developers, IT professionals, and enterprises freedom to build, deploy, and manage applications on any platform or device. Customers can use Azure through our global network of datacenters for computing, networking, storage, mobile and web application services, AI, IoT, cognitive services, and machine learning. Azure enables customers to devote more resources to development and use of applications that benefit their organizations, rather than managing on-premises hardware and software. Azure revenue is mainly affected by infrastructure-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service consumption-based services, and per user-based services such as Enterprise Mobility + Security. Our server products are designed to make IT professionals, developers, and their systems more productive and efficient. Server software is integrated server infrastructure and middleware designed to support software applications built on the Windows Server operating system. This includes the server platform, database, business intelligence, storage, management and operations, virtualization, service-oriented architecture platform, security, and identity software. We also license standalone and software development lifecycle tools for software architects, developers, testers, and project managers. GitHub provides a collaboration platform and code hosting service for developers. Server products revenue is mainly affected by purchases through volume licensing programs, licenses sold to original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”), and retail packaged products. CALs provide access rights to certain server products, including SQL Server and Windows Server, and revenue is reported along with the associated server product. Enterprise Services Enterprise Services, including Premier Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services, assist customers in developing, deploying, and managing Microsoft server and desktop solutions and provide training and certification to developers and IT professionals on various Microsoft products. 12 PART I Item 1 Competition Azure faces diverse competition from companies such as Amazon, Google, IBM, Oracle, VMware, and open source offerings. Our Enterprise Mobility + Security offerings also compete with products from a range of competitors including identity vendors, security solution vendors, and numerous other security point solution vendors. Azure’s competitive advantage includes enabling a hybrid cloud, allowing deployment of existing datacenters with our public cloud into a single, cohesive infrastructure, and the ability to run at a scale that meets the needs of businesses of all sizes and complexities. We believe our cloud’s global scale, coupled with our broad portfolio of identity and security solutions, allows us to effectively solve complex cybersecurity challenges for our customers and differentiates us from the competition. Our server products face competition from a wide variety of server operating systems and applications offered by companies with a range of market approaches. Vertically integrated computer manufacturers such as Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and Oracle offer their own versions of the Unix operating system preinstalled on server hardware. Nearly all computer manufacturers offer server hardware for the Linux operating system and many contribute to Linux operating system development. The competitive position of Linux has also benefited from the large number of compatible applications now produced by many commercial and non-commercial software developers. A number of companies, such as Red Hat, supply versions of Linux. We compete to provide enterprise-wide computing solutions and point solutions with numerous commercial software vendors that offer solutions and middleware technology platforms, software applications for connectivity (both Internet and intranet), security, hosting, database, and e-business servers. IBM and Oracle lead a group of companies focused on the Java Platform Enterprise Edition that competes with our enterprise-wide computing solutions. Commercial competitors for our server applications for PC-based distributed client-server environments include CA Technologies, IBM, and Oracle. Our web application platform software competes with open source software such as Apache, Linux, MySQL, and PHP. In middleware, we compete against Java vendors. Our database, business intelligence, and data warehousing solutions offerings compete with products from IBM, Oracle, SAP, and other companies. Our system management solutions compete with server management and server virtualization platform providers, such as BMC, CA Technologies, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and VMware. Our products for software developers compete against offerings from Adobe, IBM, Oracle, and other companies, and also against open-source projects, including Eclipse (sponsored by CA Technologies, IBM, Oracle, and SAP), PHP, and Ruby on Rails. We believe our server products provide customers with advantages in performance, total costs of ownership, and productivity by delivering superior applications, development tools, compatibility with a broad base of hardware and software applications, security, and manageability. Our Enterprise Services business competes with a wide range of companies that provide strategy and business planning, application development, and infrastructure services, including multinational consulting firms and small niche businesses focused on specific technologies. More Personal Computing Our More Personal Computing segment consists of products and services that put customers at the center of the experience with our technology. This segment primarily comprises: • Windows, including Windows OEM licensing (“Windows OEM”) and other non-volume licensing of the Windows operating system; Windows Commercial, comprising volume licensing of the Windows operating system, Windows cloud services, and other Windows commercial offerings; patent licensing; Windows IoT; and MSN advertising. • Devices, including Surface and PC accessories. • Gaming, including Xbox hardware and Xbox content and services, comprising digital transactions, Xbox Game Pass and other subscriptions, video games, third-party video game royalties, cloud services, and advertising. • Search advertising. 13 PART I Item 1 Windows The Windows operating system is designed to deliver a more personal computing experience for users by enabling consistency of experience, applications, and information across their devices. Windows OEM revenue is impacted significantly by the number of Windows operating system licenses purchased by OEMs, which they pre-install on the devices they sell. In addition to computing device market volume, Windows OEM revenue is impacted by: • The mix of computing devices based on form factor and screen size. • Differences in device market demand between developed markets and growth markets. • Attachment of Windows to devices shipped. • Customer mix between consumer, small and medium businesses, and large enterprises. • Changes in inventory levels in the OEM channel. • Pricing changes and promotions, pricing variation that occurs when the mix of devices manufactured shifts from local and regional system builders to large multinational OEMs, and different pricing of Windows versions licensed. • Constraints in the supply chain of device components. • Piracy. Windows Commercial revenue, which includes volume licensing of the Windows operating system and Windows cloud services such as Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection, is affected mainly by the demand from commercial customers for volume licensing and Software Assurance (“SA”), as well as advanced security offerings. Windows Commercial revenue often reflects the number of information workers in a licensed enterprise and is relatively independent of the number of PCs sold in a given year. Patent licensing includes our programs to license patents we own for use across a broad array of technology areas, including mobile devices and cloud offerings. Windows IoT extends the power of Windows and the cloud to intelligent systems by delivering specialized operating systems, tools, and services for use in embedded devices. MSN advertising includes both native and display ads. Devices We design and sell devices, including Surface and PC accessories. Our devices are designed to enable people and organizations to connect to the people and content that matter most using Windows and integrated Microsoft products and services. Surface is designed to help organizations, students, and consumers be more productive. Growth in Devices is dependent on total PC shipments, the ability to attract new customers, our product roadmap, and expanding into new categories. Gaming Our gaming platform is designed to provide a variety of entertainment through a unique combination of content, community, and cloud. Our exclusive game content is created through Xbox Game Studios, a collection of first-party studios creating iconic and differentiated gaming experiences. We continue to invest in new gaming studios and content to expand our IP roadmap and leverage new content creators. These unique gaming experiences are the cornerstone of Xbox Game Pass, a subscription service and gaming community with access to a curated library of over 100 first- and third-party console and PC titles. The gamer remains at the heart of the Xbox ecosystem. We continue to open new opportunities for gamers to engage both on- and off-console with both the launch of Xbox Cloud Gaming, our game streaming service, and continued investment in gaming hardware. Xbox Cloud Gaming utilizes Microsoft’s Azure cloud technology to allow direct and on-demand streaming of games to PCs, consoles, and mobile devices, enabling gamers to take their favorites games with them and play on the device most convenient to them. 14 PART I Item 1 Xbox enables people to connect and share online gaming experiences that are accessible on Xbox consoles, Windows-enabled devices, and other devices. Xbox is designed to benefit users by providing access to a network of certified applications and services and to benefit our developer and partner ecosystems by providing access to a large customer base. Xbox revenue is mainly affected by subscriptions and sales of first- and third-party content, as well as advertising. Growth of our Gaming business is determined by the overall active user base through Xbox enabled content, availability of games, providing exclusive game content that gamers seek, the computational power and reliability of the devices used to access our content and services, and the ability to create new experiences through first-party content creators. Search Advertising Our Search business, including Bing and Microsoft Advertising, is designed to deliver relevant online advertising to a global audience. We have several partnerships with other companies, including Verizon Media Group, through which we provide and monetize search queries. Growth depends on our ability to attract new users, understand intent, and match intent with relevant content and advertiser offerings. Competition Windows faces competition from various software products and from alternative platforms and devices, mainly from Apple and Google. We believe Windows competes effectively by giving customers choice, value, flexibility, security, an easy-to-use interface, and compatibility with a broad range of hardware and software applications, including those that enable productivity. Devices face competition from various computer, tablet, and hardware manufacturers who offer a unique combination of high-quality industrial design and innovative technologies across various price points. These manufacturers, many of which are also current or potential partners and customers, include Apple and our Windows OEMs. Xbox and our cloud gaming services face competition from various online gaming ecosystems and game streaming services, including those operated by Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Tencent. We also compete with other providers of entertainment services such as video streaming platforms. Our gaming platform competes with console platforms from Nintendo and Sony, both of which have a large, established base of customers. We believe our gaming platform is effectively positioned against, and uniquely differentiated from, competitive products and services based on significant innovation in hardware architecture, user interface, developer tools, online gaming and entertainment services, and continued strong exclusive content from our own first-party game franchises as well as other digital content offerings. Our search business competes with Google and a wide array of websites, social platforms like Facebook, and portals that provide content and online offerings to end users. OPERATIONS We have operations centers that support operations in their regions, including customer contract and order processing, credit and collections, information processing, and vendor management and logistics. The regional center in Ireland supports the European, Middle Eastern, and African region; the center in Singapore supports the Japan, India, Greater China, and Asia-Pacific region; and the centers in Fargo, North Dakota, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Puerto Rico, Redmond, Washington, and Reno, Nevada support Latin America and North America. In addition to the operations centers, we also operate datacenters throughout the Americas, Europe, Australia, and Asia, as well as in the Middle East and Africa. To serve the needs of customers around the world and to improve the quality and usability of products in international markets, we localize many of our products to reflect local languages and conventions. Localizing a product may require modifying the user interface, altering dialog boxes, and translating text. Our devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However, some of our products contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. For these components, we have limited near-term flexibility to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or is unable to meet our requirements. Extended disruptions at these suppliers could lead to a similar disruption in our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand. 15 PART I Item 1 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Product and Service Development, and Intellectual Property We develop most of our products and services internally through the following engineering groups. • Cloud and AI , focuses on making IT professionals, developers, and their systems more productive and efficient through development of cloud infrastructure, server, database, CRM, ERP, management and development tools, AI cognitive services, and other business process applications and services for enterprises. • Experiences and Devices , focuses on instilling a unifying product ethos across our end-user experiences and devices, including Office, Windows, Enterprise Mobility + Security, and Surface. • AI and Research , focuses on our AI innovations and other forward-looking research and development efforts spanning infrastructure, services, applications, and search. • LinkedIn , focuses on our services that transform the way customers hire, market, sell, and learn. • Gaming , focuses on developing hardware, content, and services across a large range of platforms to help grow our user base through game experiences and social interaction. Internal development allows us to maintain competitive advantages that come from product differentiation and closer technical control over our products and services. It also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented. We strive to obtain information as early as possible about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software and hardware design. Before releasing new software platforms, and as we make significant modifications to existing platforms, we provide application vendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development, training, and testing. Generally, we also create product documentation internally. We protect our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways. We work actively in the U.S. and internationally to ensure the enforcement of copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other protections that apply to our software and hardware products, services, business plans, and branding. We are a leader among technology companies in pursuing patents and currently have a portfolio of over 65,000 U.S. and international patents issued and over 21,000 pending worldwide. While we employ much of our internally-developed intellectual property exclusively in our products and services, we also engage in outbound licensing of specific patented technologies that are incorporated into licensees’ products. From time to time, we enter into broader cross-license agreements with other technology companies covering entire groups of patents. We may also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products and services. At times, we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective, such as promoting industry standards, advancing interoperability, supporting societal and/or environmental efforts, or attracting and enabling our external development community. Our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products, services, and business methods, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. We believe our continuing research and product development are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products. Investing in the Future Our success is based on our ability to create new and compelling products, services, and experiences for our users, to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new geographic and product markets, and to drive broad adoption of our products and services. We invest in a range of emerging technology trends and breakthroughs that we believe offer significant opportunities to deliver value to our customers and growth for the Company. Based on our assessment of key technology trends, we maintain our long-term commitment to research and development across a wide spectrum of technologies, tools, and platforms spanning digital work and life experiences, cloud computing, AI, devices, and operating systems. While our main product research and development facilities are located in Redmond, Washington, we also operate research and development facilities in other parts of the U.S. and around the world. This global approach helps us remain competitive in local markets and enables us to continue to attract top talent from across the world. 16 PART I Item 1 In addition to our main research and development operations, we also operate Microsoft Research. Microsoft Research is one of the world’s largest corporate research organizations and works in close collaboration with top universities around the world to advance the state-of-the-art in computer science and a broad range of other disciplines, providing us a unique perspective on future trends and contributing to our innovation. We generally fund research at the corporate level to ensure that we are looking beyond immediate product considerations to opportunities further in the future. We also fund research and development activities at the operating segment level. Much of our segment level research and development is coordinated with other segments and leveraged across the Company. We plan to continue to make significant investments in a broad range of research and development efforts. DISTRIBUTION, SALES, AND MARKETING We market and distribute our products and services through the following channels: OEMs, direct, and distributors and resellers. Our sales force performs a variety of functions, including working directly with commercial enterprises and public-sector organizations worldwide to identify and meet their technology and digital transformation requirements; managing OEM relationships; and supporting system integrators, independent software vendors, and other partners who engage directly with our customers to perform sales, consulting, and fulfillment functions for our products and services. OEMs We distribute our products and services through OEMs that pre-install our software on new devices and servers they sell. The largest component of the OEM business is the Windows operating system pre-installed on devices. OEMs also sell devices pre-installed with other Microsoft products and services, including applications such as Office and the capability to subscribe to Office 365. There are two broad categories of OEMs. The largest category of OEMs are direct OEMs as our relationship with them is managed through a direct agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all the multinational OEMs, including Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, and with many regional and local OEMs. The second broad category of OEMs are system builders consisting of lower-volume PC manufacturers, which source Microsoft software for pre-installation and local redistribution primarily through the Microsoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft. Direct Many organizations that license our products and services transact directly with us through Enterprise Agreements and Enterprise Services contracts, with sales support from system integrators, independent software vendors, web agencies, and partners that advise organizations on licensing our products and services (“Enterprise Agreement Software Advisors” or “ESA”). Microsoft offers direct sales programs targeted to reach small, medium, and corporate customers, in addition to those offered through the reseller channel. A large network of partner advisors support many of these sales. We also sell commercial and consumer products and services directly to customers, such as cloud services, search, and gaming, through our digital marketplaces and online stores. In fiscal year 2021, we closed our Microsoft Store physical locations and opened our Microsoft Experience Centers. Microsoft Experience Centers are designed to facilitate deeper engagement with our partners and customers across industries. Distributors and Resellers Organizations also license our products and services indirectly, primarily through licensing solution partners (“LSP”), distributors, value-added resellers (“VAR”), and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner may reach organizations of all sizes, LSPs are primarily engaged with large organizations, distributors resell primarily to VARs, and VARs typically reach small and medium organizations. ESAs are also typically authorized as LSPs and operate as resellers for our other volume licensing programs. Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider is our main partner program for reselling cloud services. 17 PART I Item 1 We distribute our retail packaged products primarily through independent non-exclusive distributors, authorized replicators, resellers, and retail outlets. Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets. We distribute our devices through third-party retailers. We have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers, and provide product training and sales support. Our Dynamics business solutions are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and specialized services. LICENSING OPTIONS We offer options for organizations that want to purchase our cloud services, on-premises software, and SA. We license software to organizations under volume licensing agreements to allow the customer to acquire multiple licenses of products and services instead of having to acquire separate licenses through retail channels. We use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations of various sizes. While these programs may differ in various parts of the world, generally they include those discussed below. SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades for perpetual licenses released over the contract period. It also provides support, tools, training, and other licensing benefits to help customers deploy and use software efficiently. SA is included with certain volume licensing agreements and is an optional purchase with others. Volume Licensing Programs Enterprise Agreement Enterprise Agreements offer large organizations a manageable volume licensing program that gives them the flexibility to buy cloud services and software licenses under one agreement. Enterprise Agreements are designed for medium or large organizations that want to license cloud services and on-premises software organization-wide over a three-year period. Organizations can elect to purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses. SA is included. Microsoft Product and Services Agreement Microsoft Product and Services Agreements are designed for medium and large organizations that want to license cloud services and on-premises software as needed, with no organization-wide commitment, under a single, non-expiring agreement. Organizations purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses. SA is optional for customers that purchase perpetual licenses. Open Open agreements are a simple, cost-effective way to acquire the latest Microsoft technology. Open agreements are designed for small and medium organizations that want to license cloud services and on-premises software over a one- to three-year period. Under the Open agreements, organizations purchase perpetual licenses and SA is optional. Under Open Value agreements, organizations can elect to purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses and SA is included. 18 PART I Item 1 Select Plus Select Plus agreements are designed for government and academic organizations to acquire on-premises licenses at any affiliate or department level, while realizing advantages as one organization. Organizations purchase perpetual licenses and SA is optional. Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement Microsoft Online Subscription Agreements are designed for small and medium organizations that want to subscribe to, activate, provision, and maintain cloud services seamlessly and directly via the web. The agreement allows customers to acquire monthly or annual subscriptions for cloud-based services. Partner Programs The Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider program offers customers an easy way to license the cloud services they need in combination with the value-added services offered by their systems integrator, managed services provider, or cloud reseller partner. Partners in this program can easily package their own products and services to directly provision, manage, and support their customer subscriptions. The Microsoft Services Provider License Agreement allows hosting service providers and independent software vendors who want to license eligible Microsoft software products to provide software services and hosted applications to their end customers. Partners license software over a three-year period and are billed monthly based on consumption. The Independent Software Vendor Royalty program enables partners to integrate Microsoft products into other applications and then license the unified business solution to their end users. CUSTOMERS Our customers include individual consumers, small and medium organizations, large global enterprises, public-sector institutions, Internet service providers, application developers, and OEMs. Our practice is to ship our products promptly upon receipt of purchase orders from customers; consequently, backlog is not significant. 19 PART I Item 1 INFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIV E OFFICERS Our executive officers as of July 29, 2021 were as follows: Name Age Position with the Company Satya Nadella 53 Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer Judson Althoff 48 Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer Christopher C.

RISK FACTORS Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock. STRATEGIC AND COMPETITIVE RISKS We face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins. Competition in the technology sector Our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small, specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical, marketing, and financial resources. Barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products, devices, and services that appeal to businesses and consumers. Competition among platform-based ecosystems An important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions. A well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users, application developers, and the platform provider that can accelerate growth. Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins. We face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms. • A competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements of a product and related services, has succeeded with some consumer products such as personal computers, tablets, phones, gaming consoles, wearables, and other endpoint devices. Competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform, including applications and content sold through their integrated marketplaces. They may also be able to claim security and performance benefits from their vertically integrated offer. We also offer some vertically-integrated hardware and software products and services. To the extent we shift a portion of our business to a vertically integrated model we increase our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margins. • We derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on PCs. We face significant competition from competing platforms developed for new devices and form factors such as smartphones and tablet computers. These devices compete on multiple bases including price and the perceived utility of the device and its platform. Users are increasingly turning to these devices to perform functions that in the past were performed by personal computers. Even if many users view these devices as complementary to a personal computer, the prevalence of these devices may make it more difficult to attract application developers to our PC operating system platforms. Competing with operating systems licensed at low or no cost may decrease our PC operating system margins. Popular products or services offered on competing platforms could increase their competitive strength. In addition, some of our devices compete with products made by our original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) partners, which may affect their commitment to our platform. • Competing platforms have content and application marketplaces with scale and significant installed bases. The variety and utility of content and applications available on a platform are important to device purchasing decisions. Users may incur costs to move data and buy new content and applications when switching platforms. To compete, we must successfully enlist developers to write applications for our platform and ensure that these applications have high quality, security, customer appeal, and value. Efforts to compete with competitors’ content and application marketplaces may increase our cost of revenue and lower our operating margins. Competitors’ rules governing their content and applications marketplaces may restrict our ability to distribute products and services through them in accordance with our technical and business model objectives. 22 PART I Item 1A Business model competition Companies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models. • Even as we transition more of our business to infrastructure-, platform-, and software-as-a-service business model, the license-based proprietary software model generates a substantial portion of our software revenue. We bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenue received from licensing our products. Many of our competitors also develop and sell software to businesses and consumers under this model. • Other competitors develop and offer free applications, online services and content, and make money by selling third-party advertising. Advertising revenue funds development of products and services these competitors provide to users at no or little cost, competing directly with our revenue-generating products. • Some companies compete with us by modifying and then distributing open source software at little or no cost to end users, and earning revenue on advertising or integrated products and services. These firms do not bear the full costs of research and development for the open source software. Some open source software mimics the features and functionality of our products. The competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for research and development, marketing, and sales incentives. This may lead to lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income. Our increasing focus on cloud-based services presents execution and competitive risks. A growing part of our business involves cloud-based services available across the spectrum of computing devices. Our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building best-in-class platforms and productivity services for an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with artificial intelligence (“AI”). At the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and business customers. Pricing and delivery models are evolving. Devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user’s choice of which cloud-based services to use. We are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies. The Windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment. We embrace cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation. Our intelligent cloud and intelligent edge worldview is connected with the growth of the Internet of Things (“IoT”). Our success in the IoT will depend on the level of adoption of our offerings such as Azure, Azure Stack, Azure IoT Edge, and Azure Sphere. We may not establish market share sufficient to achieve scale necessary to achieve our business objectives. Besides software development costs, we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services. These costs will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved. Whether we succeed in cloud-based services depends on our execution in several areas, including: • Continuing to bring to market compelling cloud-based experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share. • Maintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance of our cloud-based services on the growing array of computing devices, including PCs, smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, and other devices, as well as sensors and other IoT endpoints. • Continuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third-party developers. • Ensuring our cloud-based services meet the reliability expectations of our customers and maintain the security of their data as well as help them meet their own compliance needs. • Making our suite of cloud-based services platform-agnostic, available on a wide range of devices and ecosystems, including those of our competitors. It is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed. If we are not effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services, we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above. This may negatively impact gross margins and operating income. 23 PART I Item 1A RISKS RELATING TO THE EVOLUTION OF OUR BUSINESS We make significant investments in products and services that may not achieve expected returns. We will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the Windows operating system, Microsoft 365, Office, Bing, SQL Server, Windows Server, Azure, Office 365, Xbox, LinkedIn, and other products and services. We also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment including PCs, tablets, gaming devices, and HoloLens. Investments in new technology are speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. We may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. New products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically. We may not get engagement in certain features, like Edge and Bing, that drive post-sale monetization opportunities. Our data handling practices across our products and services will continue to be under scrutiny and perceptions of mismanagement, driven by regulatory activity or negative public reaction to our practices or product experiences, which could negatively impact product and feature adoption, product design, and product quality. Developing new technologies is complex. It can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue. Acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business. We expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. For example, in October 2018 we completed our acquisition of GitHub, Inc. (“GitHub”) for $7.5 billion, in March 2021 we completed our acquisition of ZeniMax Media Inc. for $8.1 billion, and in April 2021 we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Nuance Communications, Inc. for $19.7 billion. These acquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks, including that they do not advance our business strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment, that we have difficulty integrating and retaining new employees, business systems, and technology, that they distract management from our other businesses, or that announced transactions may not be completed. If an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party, it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement. The success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones. It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements such as increased revenue or enhanced efficiencies, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected. These events could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements. If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings. We acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. We review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate. We have in the past recorded, and may in the future be required to record, a significant charge in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively affecting our results of operations. 24 PART I Item 1A CYBERSECURITY, DATA PRIVACY, AND PLATFORM ABUSE RISKS Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our reputation or competitive position. Security of our information technology Threats to IT security can take a variety of forms. Individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including state-sponsored organizations or nation-states, continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our IT. These actors may use a wide variety of methods, which may include developing and deploying malicious software or exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware, software, or other infrastructure in order to attack our products and services or gain access to our networks and datacenters, using social engineering techniques to induce our employees, users, partners, or customers to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users’ or customers’ data, or acting in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks. Nation state and state sponsored actors can deploy significant resources to plan and carry out exploits. Inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access to confidential data. For example, system administrators may fail to timely remove employee account access when no longer appropriate. Employees or third parties may intentionally compromise our or our users’ security or systems or reveal confidential information. Malicious actors may employ the IT supply chain to introduce malware through software updates or compromised supplier accounts or hardware. Cyberthreats are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. We may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities, which may allow them to persist in the environment over long periods of time. Cyberthreats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and customers. Breaches of our facilities, network, or data security could disrupt the security of our systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in product development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies or remediate the impacts of attacks, or otherwise adversely affect our business. The cyberattacks uncovered in late 2020 known as “Solorigate” or “Nobelium” are an example of a supply chain attack where malware was introduced to a software provider’s customers, including us, through software updates. The attackers were later able to create false credentials that appeared legitimate to certain customers’ systems. We may be targets of further attacks similar to Solorigate/Nobelium as both a supplier and consumer of IT. In addition, our internal IT environment continues to evolve. Often, we are early adopters of new devices and technologies. We embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies. Our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge. 25 PART I Item 1A Security of our products, services, devices, and customers’ data The security of our products and services is important in our customers’ decisions to purchase or use our products or services across cloud and on-premises environments. Security threats are a significant challenge to companies like us whose business is providing technology products and services to others. Threats to our own IT infrastructure can also affect our customers. Customers using our cloud-based services rely on the security of our infrastructure, including hardware and other elements provided by third parties, to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data. Adversaries tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and services, including many of ours, and we expect that to continue. In addition, adversaries can attack our customers’ on-premises or cloud environments, sometimes exploiting previously unknown (“zero day”) vulnerabilities, such as occurred in early calendar year 2021 with several of our Exchange Server on-premises products. Vulnerabilities in these or any product can persist even after we have issued security patches if customers have not installed the most recent updates, or if the attackers exploited the vulnerabilities before patching to install additional malware to further compromise customers’ systems. Adversaries will continue to attack customers using our cloud services as customers embrace digital transformation. Adversaries that acquire user account information can use that information to compromise our users’ accounts, including where accounts share the same attributes as passwords. Inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access, and user activity may result in ransomware or other malicious software impacting a customer’s use of our products or services. We are increasingly incorporating open source software into our products. There may be vulnerabilities in open source software that may make our products susceptible to cyberattacks. Our customers operate complex IT systems with third-party hardware and software from multiple vendors that may include systems acquired over many years. They expect our products and services to support all these systems and products, including those that no longer incorporate the strongest current security advances or standards. As a result, we may not be able to discontinue support in our services for a product, service, standard, or feature solely because a more secure alternative is available. Failure to utilize the most current security advances and standards can increase our customers’ vulnerability to attack. Further, customers of widely varied size and technical sophistication use our technology, and consequently may have limited capabilities and resources to help them adopt and implement state of the art cybersecurity practices and technologies. In addition, we must account for this wide variation of technical sophistication when defining default settings for our products and services, including security default settings, as these settings may limit or otherwise impact other aspects of IT operations and some customers may have limited capability to review and reset these defaults. The Solorigate/Nobelium or similar cyberattacks may adversely impact our customers even if our production services are not directly compromised. We are committed to notifying our customers whose systems have been impacted as we become aware and have available information and actions for customers to help protect themselves. We are also committed to providing guidance and support on detection, tracking, and remediation. We may not be able to detect the existence or extent of these attacks for all of our customers or have information on how to detect or track an attack, especially where an attack involves on-premises software such as Exchange Server where we may have no or limited visibility into our customers’ computing environments. Development and deployment of defensive measures To defend against security threats to our internal IT systems, our cloud-based services, and our customers’ systems, we must continuously engineer more secure products and services, enhance security and reliability features, improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities in our own products as well as those provided by others, develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network, products, and services, and provide security tools such as firewalls, anti-virus software, and advanced security and information about the need to deploy security measures and the impact of doing so. Customers in certain industries such as financial services, health care, and government may have enhanced or specialized requirements to which we must engineer our product and services. 26 PART I Item 1A The cost of measures to protect products and customer-facing services could reduce our operating margins. If we fail to do these things well, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services, data corruption issues, or reduced performance could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services, or to use competing products or services. Customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional products or services. Customers, and third parties granted access to their systems, may fail to update their systems, continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support, or may fail timely to install or enable security patches, or may otherwise fail to adopt adequate security practices. Any of these could adversely affect our reputation and revenue. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. Our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, but there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges. At times, to achieve commercial objectives, we may enter into agreements with larger liability exposure to customers. Our products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem of third parties. If there is a security vulnerability in one of these components, and if there is a security exploit targeting it, we could face increased costs, liability claims, reduced revenue, or harm to our reputation or competitive position. Disclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation. As we continue to grow the number and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers and users. The continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. Despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and third parties on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure or misuse of customer or user data we or our vendors store and manage. In addition, third parties who have limited access to our customer or user data may use this data in unauthorized ways. Improper disclosure or misuse could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers or users, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Our software products and services also enable our customers and users to store and process personal data on-premises or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment we host. Government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer or user data in response to valid legal orders. In the U.S. and elsewhere, we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure. Despite our efforts to protect customer and user data, perceptions that the collection, use, and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities. Additional security measures we may take to address customer or user concerns, or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer or user expectations or governmental rules or actions, may cause higher operating expenses or hinder growth of our products and services. We may not be able to protect information in our products and services from use by others . LinkedIn and other Microsoft products and services contain valuable information and content protected by contractual restrictions or technical measures. In certain cases, we have made commitments to our members and users to limit access to or use of this information. Changes in the law or interpretations of the law may weaken our ability to prevent third parties from scraping or gathering information or content through use of bots or other measures and using it for their own benefit, thus diminishing the value of our products and services. Abuse of our platforms may harm our reputation or user engagement. Advertising, professional, and social platform abuses For platform products and services that provide content or host ads that come from or can be influenced by third parties, including GitHub, LinkedIn, Microsoft Advertising, MSN, and Xbox, our reputation or user engagement may be negatively affected by activity that is hostile or inappropriate. This activity may come from users impersonating other people or organizations, use of our products or services to spread terrorist or violent extremist content or to disseminate information that may be viewed as misleading or intended to manipulate the opinions of our users, or the use of our products or services that violates our terms of service or otherwise for objectionable or illegal ends. Preventing or responding to these actions may require us to make substantial investments in people and technology and these investments may not be successful, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements. 27 PART I Item 1A Digital safety and service misuse Our hosted consumer services as well as our enterprise services may be used by third parties to disseminate harmful or illegal content in violation of our terms or applicable law. We may not proactively discover such content due to scale and the limitations of existing technologies, and when discovered by users, such content may negatively affect our reputation, our brands, and user engagement. Regulations and other initiatives to make platforms responsible for preventing or eliminating harmful content online are gaining momentum and we expect this to continue. We may be subject to enhanced regulatory oversight, civil or criminal liability, or reputational damage if we fail to comply with content moderation regulations, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements. The development of the IoT presents security, privacy, and execution risks. To support the growth of the intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge, we are developing products, services, and technologies to power the IoT, a network of distributed and interconnected devices employing sensors, data, and computing capabilities including AI. The IoT’s great potential also carries substantial risks. IoT products and services may contain defects in design, manufacture, or operation that make them insecure or ineffective for their intended purposes. An IoT solution has multiple layers of hardware, sensors, processors, software, and firmware, several of which we may not develop or control. Each layer, including the weakest layer, can impact the security of the whole system. Many IoT devices have limited interfaces and ability to be updated or patched. IoT solutions may collect large amounts of data, and our handling of IoT data may not satisfy customers or regulatory requirements. IoT scenarios may increasingly affect personal health and safety. If IoT solutions that include our technologies do not work as intended, violate the law, or harm individuals or businesses, we may be subject to legal claims or enforcement actions. These risks, if realized, may increase our costs, damage our reputation or brands, or negatively impact our revenues or margins. Issues in the use of AI in our offerings may result in reputational harm or liability . We are building AI into many of our offerings and we expect this element of our business to grow. We envision a future in which AI operating in our devices, applications, and the cloud helps our customers be more productive in their work and personal lives. As with many disruptive innovations, AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. AI algorithms may be flawed. Datasets may be insufficient or contain biased information. Inappropriate or controversial data practices by Microsoft or others could impair the acceptance of AI solutions. These deficiencies could undermine the decisions, predictions, or analysis AI applications produce, subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability, and brand or reputational harm. Some AI scenarios present ethical issues. If we enable or offer AI solutions that are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or other social issues, we may experience brand or reputational harm. OPERATIONAL RISKS We may have excessive outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure. Our increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power. We spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters. These demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth of existing services such as Bing, Azure, Microsoft Account services, Microsoft 365, Microsoft Teams, Dynamics 365, OneDrive, SharePoint Online, Skype, Xbox, and Outlook.com. We are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users. Maintaining, securing, and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex, and requires development of principles for datacenter builds in geographies with higher safety risks. It requires that we maintain an Internet connectivity infrastructure and storage and compute capacity that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve. Inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data, insufficient Internet connectivity, or inadequate storage and compute capacity, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, regulatory actions, damage to our reputation, and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may adversely impact our consolidated financial statements. We may experience quality or supply problems. Our hardware products such as Xbox consoles, Surface devices, and other devices we design and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. We could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm as a result of recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims if we fail to prevent, detect, or address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs. 28 PART I Item 1A Our software products and services also may experience quality or reliability problems. The highly sophisticated software we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. Our customers increasingly rely on us for critical business functions and multiple workloads. Many of our products and services are interdependent with one another. Each of these circumstances potentially magnifies the impact of quality or reliability issues. Any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability. Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge. We acquire some device and datacenter components from sole suppliers. Our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us. If a component from a sole-source supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint, industry shortages, legal or regulatory changes that restrict supply sources, or other reasons, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity. Component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue. Xbox consoles, Surface devices, datacenter servers, and other hardware are assembled in Asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins. These same risks would apply to any other hardware and software products we may offer. LEGAL, REGULATORY, AND LITIGATION RISKS Government litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products. As a leading global software and device maker, government agencies closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign competition laws. Governments are actively enforcing competition laws and regulations, and this includes scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the European Union (“EU”), the U.S., and China. Some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. U.S. federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business. The European Commission (“the Commission”) closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume Microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. Flagship product releases such as Windows can receive significant scrutiny under competition laws. For example, in 2004, the Commission ordered us to create new versions of our Windows operating system that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary Windows communications protocols in their own products. In 2009, the Commission accepted a set of commitments we offered to address the Commission’s concerns relating to competition in web browsing software, including an undertaking to address Commission concerns relating to interoperability. The web browsing commitments expired in 2014. The remaining obligations may limit our ability to innovate in Windows or other products in the future, diminish the developer appeal of the Windows platform, and increase our product development costs. The availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our products, which could hamper sales of our products. Our portfolio of first-party devices continues to grow; at the same time our OEM partners offer a large variety of devices for our platforms. As a result, increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our OEM partners, creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules. Regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase. Certain foreign governments, particularly in China and other countries in Asia, have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property. Government regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may result in fines or hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses, reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that come from them. New competition law actions could be initiated, potentially using previous actions as precedent. The outcome of such actions, or steps taken to avoid them, could adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including: • We may have to choose between withdrawing products from certain geographies to avoid fines or designing and developing alternative versions of those products to comply with government rulings, which may entail a delay in a product release and removing functionality that customers want or on which developers rely. 29 PART I Item 1A • We may be required to make available licenses to our proprietary technologies on terms that do not reflect their fair market value or do not protect our associated intellectual property. • We are subject to a variety of ongoing commitments because of court or administrative orders, consent decrees, or other voluntary actions we have taken. If we fail to comply with these commitments, we may incur litigation costs and be subject to substantial fines or other remedial actions. • Our ability to realize anticipated Windows post-sale monetization opportunities may be limited. Our global operations subject us to potential consequences under anti-corruption, trade, and other laws and regulations. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other anti-corruption laws and regulations (“Anti-Corruption Laws”) prohibit corrupt payments by our employees, vendors, or agents, and the accounting provisions of the FCPA require us to maintain accurate books and records and adequate internal controls. From time to time, we receive inquiries from authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere which may be based on reports from employees and others about our business activities outside the U.S. and our compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws. Periodically, we receive such reports directly and investigate them. On July 22, 2019, our Hungarian subsidiary entered into a non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”) with the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and we agreed to the terms of a cease and desist order with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These agreements required us to pay $25.3 million in monetary penalties, disgorgement, and interest pertaining to activities at Microsoft’s subsidiary in Hungary. The NPA, which has a three-year term, also contains certain ongoing compliance requirements, including the obligations to disclose to the DOJ issues that may implicate the FCPA and to cooperate in any inquiries. Most countries in which we operate also have competition laws that prohibit competitors from colluding or otherwise attempting to reduce competition between themselves. While we devote substantial resources to our U.S. and international compliance programs and have implemented policies, training, and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments and collusive activity, our employees, vendors, or agents may violate our policies. Our failure to comply with Anti-Corruption Laws or competition laws could result in significant fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Increasing trade laws, policies, sanctions, and other regulatory requirements also affect our operations in and outside the U.S. relating to trade and investment. Economic sanctions in the U.S., the EU, and other countries prohibit most business with restricted entities or countries such as Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria. U.S. export controls restrict Microsoft from offering many of its products and services to, or making investments in, certain entities in specified countries. U.S. import controls restrict us from integrating certain information and communication technologies into our supply chain and allow for government review of transactions involving information and communications technology from countries determined to be foreign adversaries. Non-compliance could result in reputational harm, operational delays, monetary fines, loss of export privileges, or criminal sanctions. Other regulatory areas that may apply to our products and online services offerings include requirements related to user privacy, telecommunications, data storage and protection, advertising, and online content. For example, some regulators are taking the position that our offerings such as Microsoft Teams and Skype are covered by existing laws regulating telecommunications services, and some new laws, including EU Member State laws under the European Electronic Communications Code, are defining more of our services as regulated telecommunications services. This trend may continue and will result in these offerings being subjected to additional data protection, security, and law enforcement surveillance obligations. Regulators may assert that our collection, use, and management of customer and other data is inconsistent with their laws and regulations. Legislative or regulatory action relating to cybersecurity requirements may increase the costs to develop, implement, or secure our products and services. Legislative and regulatory action is emerging in the areas of AI and content moderation, which could increase costs or restrict opportunity. Applying these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Additionally, these laws and governments’ approach to their enforcement, and our products and services, are continuing to evolve. Compliance with these types of regulation may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we stop the alleged noncompliant activity. We strive to empower all people and organizations to achieve more, and accessibility of our products is an important aspect of this goal. There is increasing pressure from advocacy groups, regulators, competitors, customers, and other stakeholders to make technology more accessible. If our products do not meet customer expectations or global accessibility requirements, we could lose sales opportunities or face regulatory or legal actions. 30 PART I Item 1A Laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased costs, legal claims, fines against us, or reputational damage . The growth of our Internet- and cloud-based services internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries. Legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, and transfer of personal data continue to evolve. For example, in July 2020 the Court of Justice of the EU invalidated a framework called Privacy Shield for companies to transfer data from EU member states to the United States. This ruling has led to uncertainty about the legal requirements for data transfers from the EU under other l egal mechanisms. Potential new rules and restrictions on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services in some markets. In May 2018, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), became effective. The law, which applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to products and services offered in the EU, imposes a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data. Engineering efforts to build and maintain capabilities to facilitate compliance with the law have entailed substantial expense and the diversion of engineering resources from other projects and may continue to do so. We might experience reduced demand for our offerings if we are unable to engineer products that meet our legal duties or help our customers meet their obligations under the GDPR or other data regulations, or if our implementation to comply with the GDPR make s our offerings less attractive. The GDPR imposes significant new obligations and compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them. If we fail to comply with the GDPR, or if regulators assert we have failed to comply with the GDPR, it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions, which can result in monetary penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue, private lawsuits, reputational damage , and loss of customers . Countries around the world, and states in the U.S . such as California , Colorado, and Virginia , ha ve adopted, or are considering adopting or expanding , laws and regulations imposing obligations regarding the handling of personal data. The Company’s investment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the value of the services we deliver to customers, to our operational efficiency and key opportunities in monetization, customer perceptions of quality, and operational efficiency. Our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory developments that impede realizing the expected return from this investment. Ongoing legal analyses, reviews, and inquiries by regulators of Microsoft practices, or relevant practices of other organizations, may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements, including data sovereignty and localization requirements, affecting the location, movement, collection, and use of our customer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding personal data may require changes in services, business practices, or internal systems that result in increased costs, lower revenue, reduced efficiency, or greater difficulty in competing with foreign-based firms. Compliance with data regulations might limit our ability to innovate or offer certain features and functionality in some jurisdictions where we operate. Failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity, as well as negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort. We have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes. We are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. These claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives, including major new product releases such as Windows, significant business transactions, warranty or product claims, and employment practices. Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. The litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. A material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Our business with government customers may present additional uncertainties. We derive substantial revenue from government contracts. Government contracts generally can present risks and challenges not present in private commercial agreements. For instance, we may be subject to government audits and investigations relating to these contracts, we could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor, we could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, and under certain circumstances contracts may be rescinded. Some agreements may allow a government to terminate without cause and provide for higher liability limits for certain losses. Some contracts may be subject to periodic funding approval, reductions, or delays which could adversely impact public-sector demand for our products and services. These events could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition, and reputation. 31 PART I Item 1A We may have additional tax liabilities. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, compliance with the 2017 United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) and possible future legislative changes may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the Company, the use of estimates in our consolidated financial statements, and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions. As regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the TCJA or possible future legislative changes , and as we gather more information and perform more analysis, our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements. We regularly are under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. Although we believe that our provision for income taxes and our tax estimates are reasonable, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken. In addition, economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. We are currently under Internal Revenue Service audit for prior tax years, with the primary unresolved issues relating to transfer pricing. The final resolution of those audits, and other audits or litigation, may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made. We earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S. A change in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our business or structure, or the expiration of or disputes about certain tax agreements in a particular country may result in higher effective tax rates for the Company. In addition, changes in U.S. federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries, including in the U.S., and changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions may materially adversely impact our consolidated financial statements. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS We may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure. Source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. Although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to several licensees, we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code. If our source code leaks, we might lose future trade secret protection for that code. It may then become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. Unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described elsewhere in these risk factors. Legal changes, our evolving business model, piracy, and other factors may decrease the value of our intellectual property. Protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property on a global basis is difficult. While piracy adversely affects U.S. revenue, the impact on revenue from outside the U.S. is more significant, particularly countries in which the legal system provides less protection for intellectual property rights. Our revenue in these markets may grow more slowly than the underlying device market. Similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights. Throughout the world, we educate users about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks, and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. Reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue. We expend significant resources to patent the intellectual property we create with the expectation that we will generate revenues by incorporating that intellectual property in our products or services or, in some instances, by licensing or cross-licensing our patents to others in return for a royalty and/or increased freedom to operate. Changes in the law may continue to weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patents. These include legislative changes and regulatory actions that make it more difficult to obtain injunctions, and the increasing use of legal process to challenge issued patents. Similarly, licensees of our patents may fail to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties or may contest the scope and extent of their obligations. The royalties we can obtain to monetize our intellectual property may decline because of the evolution of technology, price changes in products using licensed patents, greater value from cross-licensing, or the difficulty of discovering infringements. Finally, our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations and may negatively impact revenue. 32 PART I Item 1A Third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. From time to time, others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. The number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the markets in which we compete, the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies, the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, and our offering of first-party devices, such as Surface. To resolve these claims, we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available, stop selling or redesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. These outcomes may cause operating margins to decline. Besides money damages, in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies. In some countries, such as Germany, an injunction can be issued before the parties have fully litigated the validity of the underlying patents. We have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk, and may continue to do so. GENERAL RISKS If our reputation or our brands are damaged, our business and operating results may be harmed . Our reputation and brands are globally recognized and are important to our business. Our reputation and brands affect our ability to attract and retain consumer, business, and public-sector customers. There are numerous ways our reputation or brands could be damaged. These include product safety or quality issues, or our environmental impact and sustainability, supply chain practices, or human rights record. We may experience backlash from customers, government entities, advocacy groups, employees, and other stakeholders that disagree with our product offering decisions or public policy positions. Damage to our reputation or our brands may occur from, among other things: • The introduction of new features, products, services, or terms of service that customers, users, or partners do not like. • Public scrutiny of our decisions regarding user privacy, data practices, or content. • Data security breaches, compliance failures, or actions of partners or individual employees. The proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood, speed, and magnitude of negative brand events. If our brands or reputation are damaged, it could negatively impact our revenues or margins, or ability to attract the most highly qualified employees. Adverse economic or market conditions may harm our business. Worsening economic conditions, including inflation, recession, pandemic, or other changes in economic conditions, may cause lower IT spending and adversely affect our revenue. If demand for PCs, servers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected. Our product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network. OEMs building devices that run our software have also been a significant means of distribution. The impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, OEM, or retailer, could cause sales channel disruption. Challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. As a result, allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase. We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that affect global financial markets. A significant part of our investment portfolio comprises U.S. government securities. If global financial markets decline for long periods, or if there is a downgrade of the U.S. government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt, our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced a decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements. 33 PART I Item 1A Catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business. A disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyberattack, terrorist attack, pandemic, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other critical functions. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other essential business operations are in the Seattle, Washington area, and we have other business operations in the Silicon Valley area of California, both of which are seismically active regions. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems, or the infrastructure or systems they rely on, such as power grids, could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations. Providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages in our consolidated financial statements. Abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries, which may increase our operating costs. These conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers. Geopolitical change may result in changing regulatory systems and requirements and market interventions that could impact our operating strategies, access to national, regional, and global markets, hiring, and profitability. Geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some markets or with some public-sector customers. Any of these changes may negatively impact our revenues. The occurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic may adversely affect our operations, financial condition, and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have widespread, rapidly evolving, and unpredictable impacts on global society, economies, financial markets, and business practices. Federal and state governments have implemented measures to contain the virus, including social distancing, travel restrictions, and vaccination programs. Even as efforts to contain the pandemic have made progress and some restrictions have relaxed, new variants of the virus are causing additional outbreaks. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and may continue to impact our business operations, including our employees, customers, partners, and communities, and there is substantial uncertainty in the nature and degree of its continued effects over time. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business going forward will depend on numerous evolving factors we cannot reliably predict, including the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business, and individuals' actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity including the possibility of recession or financial market instability. These factors may adversely impact consumer, business, and government spending on technology as well as customers' ability to pay for our products and services on an ongoing basis. This uncertainty also affects management’s accounting estimates and assumptions, which could result in greater variability in a variety of areas that depend on these estimates and assumptions, including investments, receivables, and forward-looking guidance. Measures to contain the virus that impact us, our partners, distributors, and suppliers may further intensify these impacts and other risks described in these Risk Factors. Any of these may adversely impact our ability to: • Maintain our operations infrastructure, including the reliability and adequate capacity of cloud services. • Satisfy our contractual and regulatory compliance obligations as we adapt to changing usage patterns, such as through datacenter load balancing. • Ensure a high-quality and consistent supply chain and manufacturing operations for our hardware devices and datacenter operations. • Effectively manage our international operations through changes in trade practices and policies. • Hire and deploy people where we most need them. • Sustain the effectiveness and productivity of our operations including our sales, marketing, engineering, and distribution functions. We may incur increased costs to effectively manage these aspects of our business. If we are unsuccessful it may adversely impact our revenues, cash flows, market share growth, and reputation. 34 PART I Item 1A The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the IT industry in particular are unclear. Environmental regulations or changes in the supply, demand or available sources of energy or other resources may affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our business. Changes in climate where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud-based services. Our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks. Our customers are located throughout the world and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. The global nature of our business creates operational, economic, and geopolitical risks. Our results of operations may be affected by global, regional, and local economic developments, monetary policy, inflation, and recession, as well as political and military disputes. In addition, our international growth strategy includes certain markets, the developing nature of which presents several risks, including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. Emerging nationalist and protectionist trends and concerns about human rights and political expression in specific countries may significantly alter the trade and commercial environments. Changes to trade policy or agreements as a result of populism, protectionism, or economic nationalism may result in higher tariffs, local sourcing initiatives, and non-local sourcing restrictions, export controls, investment restrictions, or other developments that make it more difficult to sell our products in foreign countries. Disruptions of these kinds in developed or emerging markets could negatively impact demand for our products and services or increase operating costs. Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our results of operations. Our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees. Our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. Maintaining our brand and reputation, as well as a diverse and inclusive work environment that enables all our employees to thrive, are important to our ability to recruit and retain employees. We are also limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. Changes to U.S. immigration policies that restrain the flow of technical and professional talent may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development efforts. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. How employment-related laws are interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs. 35 PART I Item 1B, 2, 3, 4 ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS We have received no written comments regarding our periodic or current reports from the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of our fiscal year 2021 that remain unresolved. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Our corporate headquarters are located in Redmond, Washington. We have approximately 15 million square feet of space located in King County, Washington that is used for engineering, sales, marketing, and operations, among other general and administrative purposes. These facilities include approximately 10 million square feet of owned space situated on approximately 520 acres of land we own at our corporate headquarters, and approximately 5 million square feet of space we lease. In addition, we own and lease space domestically that includes office and datacenter space. We also own and lease facilities internationally for datacenters, research and development, and other operations.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). This section generally discusses the results of our operations for the year ended June 30, 2021 compared to the year ended June 30, 2020. For a discussion of the year ended June 30, 2020 compared to the year ended June 30, 2019, please refer to Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2020. OVERVIEW Microsoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. We strive to create local opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world. Our platforms and tools help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness, and public-sector efficiency. They also support new startups, improve educational and health outcomes, and empower human ingenuity. We generate revenue by offering a wide range of cloud-based and other services to people and businesses; licensing and supporting an array of software products; designing, manufacturing, and selling devices; and delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience. Our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees; designing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling our products and services; datacenter costs in support of our cloud-based services; and income taxes. As the world continues to respond to COVID-19, we are working to do our part by ensuring the safety of our employees, striving to protect the health and well-being of the communities in which we operate, and providing technology and resources to our customers to help them do their best work while remote. Highlights from fiscal year 2021 compared with fiscal year 2020 included: • Commercial cloud revenue increased 34% to $69.1 billion. • Office Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 13% driven by Office 365 Commercial growth of 22%. • Office Consumer products and cloud services revenue increased 10% and Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers increased to 51.9 million. • LinkedIn revenue increased 27%. • Dynamics products and cloud services revenue increased 25% driven by Dynamics 365 growth of 43%. • Server products and cloud services revenue increased 27% driven by Azure growth of 50%. • Windows original equipment manufacturer licensing (“Windows OEM”) revenue increased slightly. • Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 14%. • Xbox content and services revenue increased 23%. • Search advertising revenue, excluding traffic acquisition costs, increased 13%. • Surface revenue increased 5%. On March 9, 2021, we completed our acquisition of ZeniMax Media Inc. (“ZeniMax”), the parent company of Bethesda Softworks LLC, for a total purchase price of $8.1 billion, consisting primarily of cash. The purchase price included $768 million of cash and cash equivalents acquired. The financial results of ZeniMax have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition. ZeniMax is reported as part of our More Personal Computing segment. Refer to Note 8 – Business Combinations of the Notes to Financial Statements ( Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K ) for further discussion. 39 PART II Item 7 Industry Trends Our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces. Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks The markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud, and in some cases, the user’s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. The investments we are making in infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins. Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one’s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. Our devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers, some of which contain certain components for which there are very few qualified suppliers. For these components, we have limited near-term flexibility to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or is unable to meet our requirements. Extended disruptions at these suppliers could lead to a similar disruption in our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand. Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. Weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies increased reported revenue and did not have a material impact on reported expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2021. Refer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) for a discussion of these factors and other risks. COVID-19 In fiscal year 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact our business operations and financial results. Cloud usage and demand benefited as customers accelerate their digital transformation priorities. Our consumer businesses also benefited from the remote environment, with continued demand for PCs and productivity tools, as well as strong engagement across our Gaming platform. We saw improvement in customer advertising spend and savings in operating expenses related to COVID-19, but experienced weakness in transactional licensing. The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact our business operations and financial operating results, and there is uncertainty in the nature and degree of its continued effects over time. Refer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) for a discussion of these factors and other risks. Seasonality Our revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Second quarter revenue is driven by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period. 40 PART II Item 7 Change in Accounting Estimate In July 2020, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment and determined we should increase the estimated useful life of server equipment from three years to four years and increase the estimated useful life of network equipment from two years to four years. This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2021. Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and equipment, net as of June 30, 2020, the effect of this change in estimate for fiscal year 2021 was an increase in operating income of $2.7 billion and net income of $2.3 billion, or $0.30 per both basic and diluted share. Reportable Segments We report our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing. The segment amounts included in MD&A are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting. All differences between our internal management reporting basis and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), along with certain corporate-level and other activity, are included in Corporate and Other. Additional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 19 – Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). Metrics We use metrics in assessing the performance of our business and to make informed decisions regarding the allocation of resources. We disclose metrics to enable investors to evaluate progress against our ambitions, provide transparency into performance trends, and reflect the continued evolution of our products and services. Our commercial and other business metrics are fundamentally connected based on how customers use our products and services. The metrics are disclosed in the MD&A or the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). Financial metrics are calculated based on GAAP results and growth comparisons relate to the corresponding period of last fiscal year. Commercial Our commercial business primarily consists of Server products and cloud services, Office Commercial, Windows Commercial, the commercial portion of LinkedIn, Enterprise Services, and Dynamics. Our commercial metrics allow management and investors to assess the overall health of our commercial business and include leading indicators of future performance. Commercial remaining performance obligation Commercial portion of revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations, which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods Commercial cloud revenue Revenue from our commercial cloud business, which includes Azure, Office 365 Commercial, the commercial portion of LinkedIn, Dynamics 365, and other commercial cloud properties Commercial cloud gross margin percentage Gross margin percentage for our commercial cloud business 41 PART II Item 7 Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud Metrics related to our Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud segments assess the health of our core businesses within these segments. The metrics reflect our cloud and on-premises product strategies and trends. Office Commercial products and cloud services revenue growth Revenue from Office Commercial products and cloud services (Office 365 subscriptions, the Office 365 portion of Microsoft 365 Commercial subscriptions, and Office licensed on-premises), comprising Office, Exchange, SharePoint, Microsoft Teams, Office 365 Security and Compliance, and Skype for Business Office Consumer products and cloud services revenue growth Revenue from Office Consumer products and cloud services, including Microsoft 365 Consumer subscriptions and Office licensed on-premises Office 365 Commercial seat growth The number of Office 365 Commercial seats at end of period where seats are paid users covered by an Office 365 Commercial subscription Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers The number of Microsoft 365 Consumer (formerly Office 365 Consumer) subscribers at end of period Dynamics products and cloud services revenue growth Revenue from Dynamics products and cloud services, including Dynamics 365, comprising a set of intelligent, cloud-based applications across ERP, CRM, Customer Insights, Power Apps, and Power Automate; and on-premises ERP and CRM applications LinkedIn revenue growth Revenue from LinkedIn, including Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, Premium Subscriptions, Sales Solutions, and Learning Solutions Server products and cloud services revenue growth Revenue from Server products and cloud services, including Azure; SQL Server, Windows Server, Visual Studio, System Center, and related Client Access Licenses (“CALs”); and GitHub More Personal Computing Metrics related to our More Personal Computing segment assess the performance of key lines of business within this segment. These metrics provide strategic product insights which allow us to assess the performance across our commercial and consumer businesses. As we have diversity of target audiences and sales motions within the Windows business, we monitor metrics that are reflective of those varying motions. Windows OEM Pro revenue growth Revenue from sales of Windows Pro licenses sold through the OEM channel, which primarily addresses demand in the commercial market Windows OEM non-Pro revenue growth Revenue from sales of Windows non-Pro licenses sold through the OEM channel, which primarily addresses demand in the consumer market 42 PART II Item 7 Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue growth Revenue from Windows Commercial products and cloud services, comprising volume licensing of the Windows operating system, Windows cloud services, and other Windows commercial offerings Surface revenue Revenue from Surface devices and accessories Xbox content and services revenue growth Revenue from Xbox content and services, comprising digital transactions, Xbox Game Pass and other subscriptions, video games, third-party video game royalties, cloud services, and advertising Search advertising revenue, excluding TAC, growth Revenue from search advertising excluding traffic acquisition costs (“TAC”) paid to Bing Ads network publishers SUMMARY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (In millions, except percentages and per share amounts) 2021 2020 Percentage Change Revenue $ 168,088 $ 143,015 18% Gross margin 115,856 96,937 20% Operating income 69,916 52,959 32% Net income 61,271 44,281 38% Diluted earnings per share 8.05 5.76 40% Adjusted net income (non-GAAP) 60,651 44,281 37% Adjusted diluted earnings per share (non-GAAP) 7.97 5.76 38% Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) are non-GAAP financial measures which exclude tax benefits related to an India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes in fiscal year 2021 . Refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section below for a reconciliation of our financial results reported in accordance with GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. See Note 12 – Income Taxes of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. Revenue increased $25.1 billion or 18% driven by growth across each of our segments. Intelligent Cloud revenue increased driven by Azure. Productivity and Business Processes revenue increased driven by Office 365 Commercial and LinkedIn. More Personal Computing revenue increased driven by Gaming. Cost of revenue increased $6.2 billion or 13% driven by growth in commercial cloud and Gaming, offset in part by a reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in estimated useful lives of our server and network equipment. Gross margin increased $18.9 billion or 20% driven by growth across each of our segments and the change in estimated useful lives of our server and network equipment. Gross margin percentage increased with the change in estimated useful lives of our server and network equipment. Excluding this impact, gross margin percentage decreased slightly driven by gross margin percentage reduction in More Personal Computing. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage increased 4 points to 71% driven by gross margin percentage improvement in Azure and the change in estimated useful lives of our server and network equipment, offset in part by sales mix shift to Azure. Operating expenses increased $2.0 billion or 4% driven by investments in cloud engineering and commercial sales, offset in part by savings related to COVID-19 across each of our segments, prior year charges associated with the closing of our Microsoft Store physical locations, and a reduction in bad debt expense. Key changes in operating expenses were: • Research and development expenses increased $1.4 billion or 8% driven by investments in cloud engineering. • Sales and marketing expenses increased $519 million or 3% driven by investments in commercial sales, offset in part by a reduction in bad debt expense. Sales and marketing included an unfavorable foreign currency impact of 2%. • General and administrative expenses were relatively unchanged, driven by prior year charges associated with the closing of our Microsoft Store physical locations, offset in part by an increase in certain employee-related expenses and business taxes. 43 PART II Item 7 Operating income increased $17.0 billion or 32% driven by growth across each of our segments and the change in estimated useful lives of our server and network equipment. Current year net income and diluted EPS were positively impacted by the tax benefit related to the India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes, which resulted in an increase to net income and diluted EPS of $620 million and $0.08, respectively. Revenue, gross margin, and operating income included a favorable foreign currency impact of 3%, 3%, and 4%, respectively.

Gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net. Interest and dividends income decreased due to lower yields on fixed-income securities. Interest expense decreased due to a decrease in outstanding long-term debt due to debt maturities. Net recognized gains on investments increased due to higher gains on equity securities. Net gains on derivatives decreased due to lower gains on foreign currency contracts. INCOME TAXES Effective Tax Rate Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 was 14% and 17%, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate was primarily due to tax benefits from a decision by the India Supreme Court on withholding taxes in the case of Engineering Analysis Centre of Excellence Private Limited vs The Commissioner of Income Tax, an agreement between the U.S. and India tax authorities related to transfer pricing, final Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) regulations, and an increase in tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. We have historically paid India withholding taxes on software sales through distributor withholding and tax audit assessments in India. In March 2021, the India Supreme Court ruled favorably for companies in 86 separate appeals, some dating back to 2012, holding that software sales are not subject to India withholding taxes. Although we were not a party to the appeals, our software sales in India were determined to be not subject to withholding taxes. Therefore, we recorded a net income tax benefit of $620 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 to reflect the results of the India Supreme Court decision impacting fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2016. Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland and Puerto Rico, tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation, and tax benefits from the India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes. The mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. In fiscal year 2021, our U.S. income before income taxes was $35.0 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $36.1 billion. In fiscal year 2020, our U.S. income before income taxes was $24.1 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $28.9 billion. Uncertain Tax Positions We settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011. In February 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. We also settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in fiscal year 2016, and a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we settled an additional portion of the IRS audits for tax years 2004 to 2013 and made a payment of $1.7 billion, including tax and interest. We remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2017. 47 PART II Item 7 As of June 30, 202 1 , the primary unresolved issues for the IRS audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have a material impact in our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved. We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved key transfer pricing issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2020, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures which exclude the tax benefits related to the India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes in fiscal year 2021. We believe these non-GAAP measures aid investors by providing additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify trends affecting our business. For comparability of reporting, management considers non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP financial results in evaluating business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures presented should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table reconciles our financial results reported in accordance with GAAP to non-GAAP financial results: (In millions, except percentages and per share amounts) 2021 2020 Percentage Change Net income $ 61,271 $ 44,281 38% Net income tax benefit related to India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes (620 ) 0 * Adjusted net income (non-GAAP) $ 60,651 $ 44,281 37% Diluted earnings per share $ 8.05 $ 5.76 40% Net income tax benefit related to India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes (0.08 ) 0 * Adjusted diluted earnings per share (non-GAAP) $ 7.97 $ 5.76 38% * Not meaningful. 48 PART II Item 7 FINANCIAL CONDITION Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $130.3 billion and $136.5 billion as of June 30, 2021 and 2020. Equity investments were $6.0 billion and $3.0 billion as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities. Valuation In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Level 3 investments are valued using internally-developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio. A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate. Cash Flows Cash from operations increased $16.1 billion to $76.7 billion for fiscal year 2021, mainly due to an increase in cash received from customers, offset in part by an increase in cash paid to suppliers and employees. Cash used in financing increased $2.5 billion to $48.5 billion for fiscal year 2021, mainly due to a $4.4 billion increase in common stock repurchases and a $1.4 billion increase in dividends paid, offset in part by a $1.8 billion decrease in repayments of debt and a $1.7 billion decrease in cash premium paid on debt exchange. Cash used in investing increased $15.4 billion to $27.6 billion for fiscal year 2021, mainly due to a $6.4 billion increase in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets, a $5.2 billion increase in additions to property and equipment, and a $4.1 billion decrease in cash from net investment purchases, sales, and maturities. Debt We issue debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment. The proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt. In March 2021 and June 2020, we exchanged a portion of our existing debt at a premium for cash and new debt with longer maturities to take advantage of favorable financing rates in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment. Refer to Note 11 – Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. 49 PART II Item 7 Unearned Revenue Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include Software Assurance (“SA”) and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service. Refer to Note 1 – Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. The following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of June 30, 2021: (In millions) Three Months Ending September 30, 2021 $ 15,922 December 31, 2021 12,646 March 31, 2022 8,786 June 30, 2022 4,171 Thereafter 2,616 Total $ 44,141 If our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction-based products and services, the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption, as applicable. Share Repurchases During fiscal years 2021 and 2020, we repurchased 101 million shares and 126 million shares of our common stock for $23.0 billion and $19.7 billion, respectively, through our share repurchase programs. All repurchases were made using cash resources. Refer to Note 16 – Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. Dividends Refer to Note 16 – Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. Additionally, we have agreed to cover damages resulting from breaches of certain security and privacy commitments in our cloud business. In evaluating estimated losses on these obligations, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. These obligations did not have a material impact in our consolidated financial statements during the periods presented. 50 PART II Item 7 Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the payments due by fiscal year for our outstanding contractual obligations as of June 30, 2021: (In millions) 2022 2023-2024 2025-2026 Thereafter Total Long-term debt: (a) Principal payments $ 8,075 $ 8,000 $ 5,250 $ 42,585 $ 63,910 Interest payments 1,628 2,847 2,438 17,320 24,233 Construction commitments (b) 8,927 529 0 0 9,456 Operating leases, including imputed interest (c) 2,801 4,956 3,469 6,747 17,973 Finance leases, including imputed interest (c) 1,341 3,256 3,774 14,096 22,467 Transition tax (d) 1,427 4,105 8,030 0 13,562 Purchase commitments (e) 29,129 1,708 446 270 31,553 Other long-term liabilities (f) 0 365 68 263 696 Total $ 53,328 $ 25,766 $ 23,475 $ 81,281 $ 183,850 (a) Refer to Note 11 – Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). (b) Refer to Note 7 – Property and Equipment of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). (c) Refer to Note 14 – Leases of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). (d) Refer to Note 12 – Income Taxes of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). (e) Amounts represent purchase commitments, including open purchase orders and take-or-pay contracts that are not presented as construction commitments above. (f) We have excluded long-term tax contingencies, other tax liabilities, and deferred income taxes of $14.6 billion from the amounts presented as the timing of these obligations is uncertain. We have also excluded unearned revenue and non-cash items. Other Planned Uses of Capital On April 11, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Nuance Communications, Inc. (“Nuance”) for $56.00 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at $19.7 billion, inclusive of Nuance’s net debt. The acquisition has been approved by Nuance’s shareholders, and we expect it to close by the end of calendar year 2021, subject to the satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology, as well as continue making acquisitions that align with our business strategy. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, datacenters, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years to support growth in our cloud offerings. We have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, Microsoft Experience Centers, and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources. Liquidity As a result of the TCJA, we are required to pay a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to U.S. income tax. Under the TCJA, the transition tax is payable in interest-free installments over eight years, with 8% due in each of the first five years, 15% in year six, 20% in year seven, and 25% in year eight. We have paid transition tax of $4.7 billion, which included $1.5 billion for fiscal year 2021. The remaining transition tax of $13.6 billion is payable over the next five years with a final payment in fiscal year 2026. We expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as dividends, share repurchases, debt maturities, material capital expenditures, and the transition tax related to the TCJA, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. 51 PART II Item 7 RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE Refer to Note 1 – Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies, as well as uncertainty in the current economic environment due to COVID-19. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, and inventories. Revenue Recognition Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided. Judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price (“SSP"") for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP. Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers. Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented. Impairment of Investment Securities We review debt investments quarterly for credit losses and impairment. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. 52 PART II Item 7 Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment indicates that the investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. We perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis. We are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine the amount of the impairment loss. Once an investment is determined to be impaired, an impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net. Goodwill We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. Research and Development Costs Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to production. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products. Legal and Other Contingencies The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. Income Taxes The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. 53 PART II Item 7 The TCJA significantly changes existing U.S. tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business. Refer to Note 12 – Income Taxes of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part I I , Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. Inventories Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. These reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. 54 PART II Item 7 STATEMENT OF MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report. The consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management’s estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing consolidated financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. These systems are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits. The Company engaged Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit and render an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). The Board of Directors, through its Audit Committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the Company, meets periodically with management, internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting. Deloitte & Touche LLP and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the Audit Committee. Satya Nadella Chief Executive Officer Amy E.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK RISKS We are exposed to economic risk from foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, and equity prices. We use derivatives instruments to manage these risks, however, they may still impact our consolidated financial statements. Foreign Currencies Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions, including hedges. Principal currency exposures include the Euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar. Interest Rate Securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We manage the average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global fixed-income indices. Credit Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Equity Securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to price risk.

We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. The recast of these prior period amounts had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income statements, or consolidated cash flows statements. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Estimates and Assumptions Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the standalone selling price (“SSP”) of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand for, our inventory; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties, including uncertainty in the current economic environment due to COVID-19. In July 2020, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment and determined we should increase the estimated useful life of server equipment from three years to four years and increase the estimated useful life of network equipment from two years to four years . This change in accounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2021. Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in property and equipment, net as of June 30, 2020, the effect of this change in estimate for fiscal year 2021 was an increase in operating income of $ 2.7 billion and net income of $ 2.3 billion, or $ 0.30 per both basic and diluted share. Foreign Currencies Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income. Revenue Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue Product revenue includes sales from operating systems, cross-device productivity applications, server applications, business solution applications, desktop and server management tools, software development tools, video games, and hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories. Service and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content such as Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and Xbox; solution support; and consulting services. Service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising and LinkedIn. 62 PART II Item 8 Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. Nature of Products and Services Licenses for on-premises software provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available to the customer. Customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide customers with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Revenue from distinct on-premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. In cases where we allocate revenue to software updates, primarily because the updates are provided at no additional charge, revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the estimated life of the related device or license. Certain volume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements, include on-premises licenses combined with Software Assurance (“SA”). SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and provides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use products more efficiently. On-premises licenses are considered distinct performance obligations when sold with SA. Revenue allocated to SA is generally recognized ratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits, given that SA comprises distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time. Cloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software, are provided on either a subscription or consumption basis. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is recognized based on the customer utilization of such resources. When cloud services require a significant level of integration and interdependency with software and the individual components are not considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud services are provided. Revenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. Revenue from consulting services is recognized as services are provided. Our hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot function without the operating system. In these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to resellers or directly to end customers through retail stores and online marketplaces. Refer to Note 19 – Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information, including revenue by significant product and service offering. Significant Judgments Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided. 63 PART II Item 8 Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP. Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers. Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented. Contract Balances and Other Receivables Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. We record a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. For multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. We record a receivable related to revenue recognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we have an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those licenses. Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include SA and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the future, LinkedIn subscriptions, Office 365 subscriptions, Xbox subscriptions, Windows 10 post-delivery support, Dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service. Refer to Note 13 – Unearned Revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes in unearned revenue during the period. Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers with financing. Examples include invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year on-premises licenses that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront. As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, other receivables due from suppliers were $ 965 million and $ 442 million, respectively, and are included in accounts receivable, net in our consolidated balance sheets. As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $ 3.4 billion and $ 2.7 billion, respectively, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. 64 PART II Item 8 Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2021 2020 2019 Balance, beginning of period $ 816 $ 434 $ 397 Charged to costs and other 234 560 153 Write-offs ( 252 ) ( 178 ) ( 116 ) Balance, end of period $ 798 $ 816 $ 434 Allowance for doubtful accounts included in our consolidated balance sheets: (In millions) June 30, 2021 2020 2019 Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts $ 751 $ 788 $ 411 Other long-term assets 47 28 23 Total $ 798 $ 816 $ 434 We record financing receivables when we offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products and services offerings through a financing program in a limited number of countries. As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, our financing receivables, net were $ 4.4 billion and $ 5.2 billion, respectively, for short-term and long-term financing receivables, which are included in other current assets and other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. We record an allowance to cover expected losses based on troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer We recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be capitalized. Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were immaterial during the periods presented and are included in other current and long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. We apply a practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs include our internal sales force compensation program and certain partner sales incentive programs as we have determined annual compensation is commensurate with annual sales activities. Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on PCs sold by original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”), to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online advertising space; costs incurred to support and maintain online products and services, including datacenter costs and royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and the amortization of capitalized software development costs. Capitalized software development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the products. Product Warranty We provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary. 65 PART II Item 8 Research and Development Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to production. Once technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $ 1.5 billion, $ 1.6 billion, and $ 1.6 billion in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Stock-Based Compensation Compensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance stock units (“PSUs”), is measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the related service or performance period. The fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. We measure the fair value of PSUs using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Compensation cost for RSUs is recognized using the straight-line method and for PSUs is recognized using the accelerated method. Compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase. Income Taxes Income tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. Certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. All deferred income taxes are classified as long-term in our consolidated balance sheets. Financial Instruments Investments We consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. 66 PART II Item 8 Debt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in fair value, excluding credit losses and impairments, are recorded in other comprehensive income . Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. To determine credit losses, we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery , then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments (referred to as the measurement alternative). We perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. Changes in value are recorded in other income (expense), net. Derivatives Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), net with offsetting gains and losses on the hedged items. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in earnings with the corresponding hedged item. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net. Fair Value Measurements We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are: • Level 1 – inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Our Level 1 investments include U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges. • Level 2 – inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies. Our Level 2 investments include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities primarily include certain over-the-counter option and swap contracts. 67 PART II Item 8 • Level 3 – inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level 3 assets and liabilities include investments in corporate notes and bonds , municipal securities , and goodwill and intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge. Unobservable inputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities. We measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis. The fair values of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. Our other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. Inventories Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use, three to seven years ; computer equipment, two to four years ; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years ; leasehold improvements, three to 20 years ; and furniture and equipment, one to 10 years . Land is not depreciated. Leases We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. For certain equipment leases, such as vehicles, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. Additionally, for certain equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU assets and liabilities. Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. 68 PART II Item 8 Intangible Assets Our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from one to 20 years . We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired. Recent Accounting Guidance Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance Financial Instruments – Credit Losses In June 2016, the FASB issued a new standard to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology under current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. We adopted the standard effective July 1, 2020. We use a forward-looking expected credit loss model for accounts receivable, loans, and other financial instruments. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities are recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of the securities. We applied a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date to align our credit loss methodology with the new standard. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted Accounting for Income Taxes In December 2019, the FASB issued a new standard to simplify the accounting for income taxes. The guidance eliminates certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences related to changes in ownership of equity method investments and foreign subsidiaries. The guidance also simplifies aspects of accounting for franchise taxes and enacted changes in tax laws or rates, and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. The standard will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2021. We have completed our assessment and concluded that adoption of the new standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. NOTE 2 — EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards. The components of basic and diluted EPS were as follows: (In millions, except earnings per share) Year Ended June 30, 2021 2020 2019 Net income available for common shareholders (A) $ 61,271 $ 44,281 $ 39,240 Weighted average outstanding shares of common stock (B) 7,547 7,610 7,673 Dilutive effect of stock-based awards 61 73 80 Common stock and common stock equivalents (C) 7,608 7,683 7,753 Earnings Per Share Basic (A/B) $ 8.12 $ 5.82 $ 5.11 Diluted (A/C) $ 8.05 $ 5.76 $ 5.06 Anti-dilutive stock-based awards excluded from the calculations of diluted EPS were immaterial during the periods presented. 69 PART II Item 8 NOTE 3 — OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET The components of other income (expense), net were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2021 2020 2019 Interest and dividends income $ 2,131 $ 2,680 $ 2,762 Interest expense ( 2,346 ) ( 2,591 ) ( 2,686 ) Net recognized gains on investments 1,232 32 648 Net gains on derivatives 17 187 144 Net gains (losses) on foreign currency remeasurements 54 ( 191 ) ( 82 ) Other, net 98 ( 40 ) ( 57 ) Total $ 1,186 $ 77 $ 729 Net Recognized Gains (Losses) on Investments Net recognized gains (losses) on debt investments were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2021 2020 2019 Realized gains from sales of available-for-sale securities $ 105 $ 50 $ 12 Realized losses from sales of available-for-sale securities ( 40 ) ( 37 ) ( 93 ) Impairments and allowance for credit losses ( 2 ) ( 17 ) ( 16 ) Total $ 63 $ ( 4 ) $ ( 97 ) Net recognized gains (losses) on equity investments were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2021 2020 2019 Net realized gains on investments sold $ 123 $ 83 $ 276 Net unrealized gains on investments still held 1,057 69 479 Impairments of investments ( 11 ) ( 116 ) ( 10 ) Total $ 1,169 $ 36 $ 745 70 PART II Item 8 NOTE 4 — INVESTMENTS Investment Components The components of investments were as follows: (In millions) Fair Value Level Adjusted Cost Basis Unrealized Gains Unrealized Losses Recorded Basis Cash and Cash Equivalents Short-term Investments Equity Investments June 30, 2021 Changes in Fair Value Recorded in Other Comprehensive Income Commercial paper Level 2 $ 4,316 $ 0 $ 0 $ 4,316 $ 1,331 $ 2,985 $ 0 Certificates of deposit Level 2 3,615 0 0 3,615 2,920 695 0 U.S. government securities Level 1 90,664 3,832 ( 111 ) 94,385 1,500 92,885 0 U.S. agency securities Level 2 807 2 0 809 0 809 0 Foreign government bonds Level 2 6,213 9 ( 2 ) 6,220 225 5,995 0 Mortgage- and asset-backed securities Level 2 3,442 22 ( 6 ) 3,458 0 3,458 0 Corporate notes and bonds Level 2 8,443 249 ( 9 ) 8,683 0 8,683 0 Corporate notes and bonds Level 3 63 0 0 63 0 63 0 Municipal securities Level 2 308 63 0 371 0 371 0 Municipal securities Level 3 95 0 ( 7 ) 88 0 88 0 Total debt investments $ 117,966 $ 4,177 $ ( 135 ) $ 122,008 $ 5,976 $ 116,032 $ 0 Changes in Fair Value Recorded in Net Income Equity investments Level 1 $ 1,582 $ 976 $ 0 $ 606 Equity investments Other 5,378 0 0 5,378 Total equity investments $ 6,960 $ 976 $ 0 $ 5,984 Cash $ 7,272 $ 7,272 $ 0 $ 0 Derivatives, net (a) 78 0 78 0 Total $ 136,318 $ 14,224 $ 116,110 $ 5,984 71 PART II Item 8 (In millions) Fair Value Level Adjusted Cost Basis Unrealized Gains Unrealized Losses Recorded Basis Cash and Cash Equivalents Short-term Investments Equity Investments June 30, 2020 Changes in Fair Value Recorded in Other Comprehensive Income Commercial paper Level 2 $ 4,687 $ 1 $ 0 $ 4,688 $ 1,618 $ 3,070 $ 0 Certificates of deposit Level 2 2,898 0 0 2,898 1,646 1,252 0 U.S. government securities Level 1 92,067 6,495 ( 1 ) 98,561 3,168 95,393 0 U.S. agency securities Level 2 2,439 2 0 2,441 449 1,992 0 Foreign government bonds Level 2 6,982 6 ( 3 ) 6,985 1 6,984 0 Mortgage- and asset-backed securities Level 2 4,865 41 ( 6 ) 4,900 0 4,900 0 Corporate notes and bonds Level 2 8,500 327 ( 17 ) 8,810 0 8,810 0 Corporate notes and bonds Level 3 58 0 0 58 0 58 0 Municipal securities Level 2 313 57 ( 4 ) 366 0 366 0 Municipal securities Level 3 91 0 0 91 0 91 0 Total debt investments $ 122,900 $ 6,929 $ ( 31 ) $ 129,798 $ 6,882 $ 122,916 $ 0 Changes in Fair Value Recorded in Net Income Equity investments Level 1 $ 1,198 $ 784 $ 0 $ 414 Equity investments Other 2,551 0 0 2,551 Total equity investments $ 3,749 $ 784 $ 0 $ 2,965 Cash $ 5,910 $ 5,910 $ 0 $ 0 Derivatives, net (a) 35 0 35 0 Total $ 139,492 $ 13,576 $ 122,951 $ 2,965 (a) Refer to Note 5 – Derivatives for further information on the fair value of our derivative instruments. Equity investments presented as “Other” in the tables above include investments without readily determinable fair values measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments, and investments measured at fair value using net asset value as a practical expedient which are not categorized in the fair value hierarchy. As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, equity investments without readily determinable fair values measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments were $ 3.3 billion and $ 1.4 billion, respectively. Unrealized Losses on Debt Investments Debt investments with continuous unrealized losses for less than 12 months and 12 months or greater and their related fair values were as follows: Less than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater Total Unrealized Losses (In millions) Fair Value Unrealized Losses Fair Value Unrealized Losses Total Fair Value June 30, 2021 U.S. government and agency securities $ 5,294 $ ( 111 ) $ 0 $ 0 $ 5,294 $ ( 111 ) Foreign government bonds 3,148 ( 1 ) 5 ( 1 ) 3,153 ( 2 ) Mortgage- and asset-backed securities 1,211 ( 5 ) 87 ( 1 ) 1,298 ( 6 ) Corporate notes and bonds 1,678 ( 8 ) 34 ( 1 ) 1,712 ( 9 ) Municipal securities 58 ( 7 ) 1 0 59 ( 7 ) Total $ 11,389 $ ( 132 ) $ 127 $ ( 3 ) $ 11,516 $ ( 135 ) 72 PART II Item 8 Less than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater Total Unrealized Losses (In millions) Fair Value Unrealized Losses Fair Value Unrealized Losses Total Fair Value June 30, 2020 U.S. government and agency securities $ 2,323 $ ( 1 ) $ 0 $ 0 $ 2,323 $ ( 1 ) Foreign government bonds 500 ( 3 ) 0 0 500 ( 3 ) Mortgage- and asset-backed securities 1,014 ( 6 ) 0 0 1,014 ( 6 ) Corporate notes and bonds 649 ( 17 ) 0 0 649 ( 17 ) Municipal securities 66 ( 4 ) 0 0 66 ( 4 ) Total $ 4,552 $ ( 31 ) $ 0 $ 0 $ 4,552 $ ( 31 ) Unrealized losses from fixed-income securities are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates.

Our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. Our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Foreign Currencies Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. Foreign currency risks related to certain non-U.S. dollar-denominated investments are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair value hedging instruments. Foreign currency risks related to certain Euro-denominated debt are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. In the past, option and forward contracts were used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue and were designated as cash flow hedging instruments. Principal currencies hedged included the Euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar. Certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign exchange rates on certain balance sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures. Interest Rate Interest rate risks related to certain fixed-rate debt are hedged using interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedging instruments to effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates. 73 PART II Item 8 Securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We manage the average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using exchange-traded option and futures contracts and over-the-counter swap and option contracts . These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in “Other contracts” in the tables below. Equity Securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to market price risk. At times, we may hold options, futures, and swap contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in “Other contracts” in the tables below. Credit Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We use credit default swap contracts to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in “Other contracts” in the tables below. Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features Certain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum liquidity of $ 1.0 billion. To the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to the standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. As of June 30, 2021, our long-term unsecured debt rating was AAA , and cash investments were in excess of $ 1.0 billion. As a result, no collateral was required to be posted. The following table presents the notional amounts of our outstanding derivative instruments measured in U.S. dollar equivalents: (In millions) June 30, 2021 June 30, 2020 Designated as Hedging Instruments Foreign exchange contracts purchased $ 635 $ 635 Foreign exchange contracts sold 6,081 6,754 Interest rate contracts purchased 1,247 1,295 Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Foreign exchange contracts purchased 14,223 11,896 Foreign exchange contracts sold 23,391 15,595 Other contracts purchased 2,456 1,844 Other contracts sold 763 757 74 PART II Item 8 Fair Values of Derivative Instruments The following table presents our derivative instruments: Derivative Derivative Derivative Derivative (In millions) Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities June 30, 2021 June 30, 2020 Designated as Hedging Instruments Foreign exchange contracts $ 76 $ ( 8 ) $ 44 $ ( 54 ) Interest rate contracts 40 0 93 0 Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Foreign exchange contracts 227 ( 291 ) 245 ( 334 ) Other contracts 56 ( 36 ) 18 ( 11 ) Gross amounts of derivatives 399 ( 335 ) 400 ( 399 ) Gross amounts of derivatives offset in the balance sheet ( 141 ) 142 ( 154 ) 158 Cash collateral received 0 ( 42 ) 0 ( 154 ) Net amounts of derivatives $ 258 $ ( 235 ) $ 246 $ ( 395 ) Reported as Short-term investments $ 78 $ 0 $ 35 $ 0 Other current assets 137 0 199 0 Other long-term assets 43 0 12 0 Other current liabilities 0 ( 182 ) 0 ( 334 ) Other long-term liabilities 0 ( 53 ) 0 ( 61 ) Total $ 258 $ ( 235 ) $ 246 $ ( 395 ) Gross derivative assets and liabilities subject to legally enforceable master netting agreements for which we have elected to offset were $ 395 million and $ 335 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2021, and $ 399 million and $ 399 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2020.

Depreciation expense declined in fiscal year 2021 due to the change in estimated useful lives of our server and network equipment. We have committed $ 9.5 billion for the construction of new buildings, building improvements, and leasehold improvements as of June 30, 2021. During fiscal year 2020, we recorded an impairment charge of $ 186 million to Property and Equipment, primarily to leasehold improvements, due to the closing of our Microsoft Store physical locations. NOTE 8 — BUSINESS COMBINATIONS ZeniMax Media Inc. On March 9, 2021 , we completed our acquisition of ZeniMax Media Inc.

Nuance Communications, Inc. On April 11, 2021 , we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Nuance Communications, Inc. (“Nuance”) for $ 56.00 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at $ 19.7 billion, inclusive of Nuance’s net debt. Nuance is a cloud and artificial intelligence (“AI”) software provider with healthcare and enterprise AI experience, and the acquisition will build on our industry-specific cloud offerings. The acquisition has been approved by Nuance’s shareholders, and we expect it to close by the end of calendar year 2021, subject to the satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. 78 PART II Item 8 NOTE 9 — GOODWILL Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill were as follows: (In millions) June 30, 2019 Acquisitions Other June 30, 2020 Acquisitions Other June 30, 2021 Productivity and Business Processes $ 24,277 $ 7 $ ( 94 ) $ 24,190 $ 0 $ 127 $ 24,317 Intelligent Cloud 11,351 1,351 ( 5 ) 12,697 505 54 13,256 More Personal Computing 6,398 96 ( 30 ) 6,464 5,556 (a) 118 (a ) 12,138 Total $ 42,026 $ 1,454 $ ( 129 ) $ 43,351 $ 6,061 $ 299 $ 49,711 (a) Includes goodwill of $ 5.5 billion related to ZeniMax. See Note 8 – Business Combinations for further information . The measurement periods for the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed end as soon as information on the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition dates becomes available, but do not exceed 12 months. Adjustments in purchase price allocations may require a change in the amounts allocated to goodwill during the periods in which the adjustments are determined. Any change in the goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency translations and purchase accounting adjustments are presented as “Other” in the table above. Also included in “Other” are business dispositions and transfers between segments due to reorganizations, as applicable. Goodwill Impairment We test goodwill for impairment annually on May 1 at the reporting unit level, primarily using a discounted cash flow methodology with a peer-based, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. We believe use of a discounted cash flow approach is the most reliable indicator of the fair values of the businesses. No instances of impairment were identified in our May 1, 2021, May 1, 2020, or May 1, 2019 tests. As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, accumulated goodwill impairment was $ 11.3 billion.

As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, the estimated fair value of long-term debt, including the current portion, was $ 70.0 billion and $ 77.1 billion, respectively. The estimated fair values are based on Level 2 inputs. Debt in the table above is comprised of senior unsecured obligations and ranks equally with our other outstanding obligations. Interest is paid semi-annually, except for the Euro-denominated debt, which is paid annually. Cash paid for interest on our debt for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $ 2.0 billion, $ 2.4 billion, and $ 2.4 billion, respectively . The following table outlines maturities of our long-term debt, including the current portion, as of June 30, 2021: (In millions) Year Ending June 30, 2022 $ 8,075 2023 2,750 2024 5,250 2025 2,250 2026 3,000 Thereafter 42,585 Total $ 63,910 81 PART II Item 8 NOTE 12 — INCOME TAXES Tax Cuts and Jobs Act On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) was enacted into law, which significantly changed existing U.S. tax law and included numerous provisions that affect our business. We recorded a provisional net charge of $ 13.7 billion related to the enactment of the TCJA in fiscal year 2018 and adjusted the provisional net charge by recording additional tax expense of $ 157 million in fiscal year 2019 pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118. In fiscal year 2019, in response to the TCJA and recently issued regulations, we transferred certain intangible properties held by our foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. and Ireland. The transfers of intangible properties resulted in a $ 2.6 billion net income tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, as the value of future tax deductions exceeded the current tax liability from foreign jurisdictions and U.S. global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) tax. Provision for Income Taxes The components of the provision for income taxes were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2021 2020 2019 Current Taxes U.S. federal $ 3,285 $ 3,537 $ 4,718 U.S. state and local 1,229 763 662 Foreign 5,467 4,444 5,531 Current taxes $ 9,981 $ 8,744 $ 10,911 Deferred Taxes U.S. federal $ 25 $ 58 $ ( 5,647 ) U.S. state and local ( 204 ) ( 6 ) ( 1,010 ) Foreign 29 ( 41 ) 194 Deferred taxes $ ( 150 ) $ 11 $ ( 6,463 ) Provision for income taxes $ 9,831 $ 8,755 $ 4,448 U.S. and foreign components of income before income taxes were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2021 2020 2019 U.S. $ 34,972 $ 24,116 $ 15,799 Foreign 36,130 28,920 27,889 Income before income taxes $ 71,102 $ 53,036 $ 43,688 82 PART II Item 8 Effective Tax Rate The items accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the U.S. federal statutory rate and our effective rate were as follows: Year Ended June 30, 2021 2020 2019 Federal statutory rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 % Effect of: Foreign earnings taxed at lower rates ( 2.7 )% ( 3.7 )% ( 4.1 )% Impact of the enactment of the TCJA 0 % 0 % 0.4 % Impact of intangible property transfers 0 % 0 % ( 5.9 )% Foreign-derived intangible income deduction ( 1.3 )% ( 1.1 )% ( 1.4 )% State income taxes, net of federal benefit 1.4 % 1.3 % 0.7 % Research and development credit ( 0.9 )% ( 1.1 )% ( 1.1 )% Excess tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation ( 2.4 )% ( 2.2 )% ( 2.2 )% Interest, net 0.5 % 1.0 % 1.0 % Other reconciling items, net ( 1.8 )% 1.3 % 1.8 % Effective rate 13.8 % 16.5 % 10.2 % We have historically paid India withholding taxes on software sales through distributor withholding and tax audit assessments in India. In March 2021, the India Supreme Court ruled favorably in the case of Engineering Analysis Centre of Excellence Private Limited vs The Commissioner of Income Tax for companies in 86 separate appeals, some dating back to 2012, holding that software sales are not subject to India withholding taxes. Although we were not a party to the appeals, our software sales in India were determined to be not subject to withholding taxes. Therefore, we recorded a net income tax benefit of $ 620 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 to reflect the results of the India Supreme Court decision impacting fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2016 . The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2021 is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland and Puerto Rico, tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation, and tax benefits from the India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes. The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2020 is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland and Puerto Rico, and tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2019 is primarily due to a $ 2.6 billion net income tax benefit related to intangible property transfers, and earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico. In fiscal year 2021 and 2020, our foreign regional operating centers in Ireland and Puerto Rico, which are taxed at rates lower than the U.S. rate, generated 82 % and 86 % of our foreign income before tax. In fiscal years 2019, our foreign regional operating centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico, which are taxed at rates lower than the U.S. rate, generated 82 % of our foreign income before tax, respectively. Other reconciling items, net consists primarily of tax credits and GILTI tax, and in fiscal year 2021, includes tax benefits from the India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes. In fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, there were no individually significant other reconciling items. 83 PART II Item 8 The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to tax benefits from the India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes, an agreement between the U.S. and India tax authorities related to transfer pricing , final TCJA regulations, and an increase in tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. The increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to a $ 2.6 billion net income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to intangible property transfers. The components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows: (In millions) June 30, 2021 2020 Deferred Income Tax Assets Stock-based compensation expense $ 502 $ 461 Accruals, reserves, and other expenses 2,960 2,721 Loss and credit carryforwards 1,090 865 Amortization 6,346 6,737 Leasing liabilities 4,060 3,025 Unearned revenue 2,659 1,553 Other 543 354 Deferred income tax assets 18,160 15,716 Less valuation allowance ( 769 ) ( 755 ) Deferred income tax assets, net of valuation allowance $ 17,391 $ 14,961 Deferred Income Tax Liabilities Book/tax basis differences in investments and debt $ ( 2,605 ) $ ( 2,642 ) Leasing assets ( 3,834 ) ( 2,817 ) Depreciation ( 1,010 ) ( 376 ) Deferred GILTI tax liabilities ( 2,815 ) ( 2,581 ) Other ( 144 ) ( 344 ) Deferred income tax liabilities $ ( 10,408 ) $ ( 8,760 ) Net deferred income tax assets $ 6,983 $ 6,201 Reported As Other long-term assets $ 7,181 $ 6,405 Long-term deferred income tax liabilities ( 198 ) ( 204 ) Net deferred income tax assets $ 6,983 $ 6,201 Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are paid or recovered. As of June 30, 2021, we had federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 304 million, $ 1.3 billion, and $ 2.0 billion, respectively. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in various years from fiscal 2022 through 2041 , if not utilized. The majority of our foreign net operating loss carryforwards do not expire. Certain acquired net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation but are expected to be realized with the exception of those which have a valuation allowance. The valuation allowance disclosed in the table above relates to the foreign net operating loss carryforwards and other net deferred tax assets that may not be realized. In fiscal year 2020, we removed $ 2.0 billion of foreign net operating losses and corresponding valuation allowances as a result of the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary. There was no impact to our consolidated financial statements. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, were $ 13.4 billion, $ 12.5 billion, and $ 8.4 billion in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. 84 PART II Item 8 Uncertain Tax Positions Gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions as of June 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019, were $ 14.6 billion, $ 13.8 billion, and $ 13.1 billion, respectively, which were primarily included in long-term income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets. If recognized, the resulting tax benefit would affect our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019 by $ 12.5 billion, $ 12.1 billion, and $ 12.0 billion, respectively. As of June 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019, we had accrued interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $ 4.3 billion, $ 4.0 billion, and $ 3.4 billion, respectively, net of income tax benefits. The provision for income taxes for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019 included interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $ 274 million, $ 579 million, and $ 515 million, respectively, net of income tax benefits. The aggregate changes in the gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2021 2020 2019 Beginning unrecognized tax benefits $ 13,792 $ 13,146 $ 11,961 Decreases related to settlements ( 195 ) ( 31 ) ( 316 ) Increases for tax positions related to the current year 790 647 2,106 Increases for tax positions related to prior years 461 366 508 Decreases for tax positions related to prior years ( 297 ) ( 331 ) ( 1,113 ) Decreases due to lapsed statutes of limitations ( 1 ) ( 5 ) 0 Ending unrecognized tax benefits $ 14,550 $ 13,792 $ 13,146 We settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011. In February 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. We also settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in fiscal year 2016, and a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we settled an additional portion of the IRS audits for tax years 2004 to 2013 and made a payment of $ 1.7 billion, including tax and interest. We remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2017 . As of June 30, 2021, the primary unresolved issues for the IRS audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have a material impact in our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved. We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved key transfer pricing issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2020 , some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. NOTE 13 — UNEARNED REVENUE Unearned revenue by segment was as follows: (In millions) June 30, 2021 2020 Productivity and Business Processes $ 22,120 $ 18,643 Intelligent Cloud 17,710 16,620 More Personal Computing 4,311 3,917 Total $ 44,141 $ 39,180 85 PART II Item 8 Changes in unearned revenue were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2021 Balance, beginning of period $ 39,180 Deferral of revenue 94,565 Recognition of unearned revenue ( 89,604 ) Balance, end of period $ 44,141 Revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations, which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods, was $ 146 billion as of June 30, 2021, of which $ 141 billion is related to the commercial portion of revenue. We expect to recognize approximately 50 % of this revenue over the next 12 months and the remainder thereafter. NOTE 14 — LEASES We have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, Microsoft Experience Centers, and certain equipment. Our leases have remaining lease terms of 1 year to 15 years, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to 5 years , and some of which include options to terminate the leases within 1 year. The components of lease expense were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2021 2020 2019 Operating lease cost $ 2,127 $ 2,043 $ 1,707 Finance lease cost: Amortization of right-of-use assets $ 921 $ 611 $ 370 Interest on lease liabilities 386 336 247 Total finance lease cost $ 1,307 $ 947 $ 617 Supplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2021 2020 2019 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities: Operating cash flows from operating leases $ 2,052 $ 1,829 $ 1,670 Operating cash flows from finance leases 386 336 247 Financing cash flows from finance leases 648 409 221 Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations: Operating leases 4,380 3,677 2,303 Finance leases 3,290 3,467 2,532 86 PART II Item 8 Supplemental balance sheet information related to leases was as follows: (In millions, except lease term and discount rate) June 30, 2021 2020 Operating Leases Operating lease right-of-use assets $ 11,088 $ 8,753 Other current liabilities $ 1,962 $ 1,616 Operating lease liabilities 9,629 7,671 Total operating lease liabilities $ 11,591 $ 9,287 Finance Leases Property and equipment, at cost $ 14,107 $ 10,371 Accumulated depreciation ( 2,306 ) ( 1,385 ) Property and equipment, net $ 11,801 $ 8,986 Other current liabilities $ 791 $ 540 Other long-term liabilities 11,750 8,956 Total finance lease liabilities $ 12,541 $ 9,496 Weighted Average Remaining Lease Term Operating leases 8 years 8 years Finance leases 12 years 13 years Weighted Average Discount Rate Operating leases 2.2 % 2.7 % Finance leases 3.4 % 3.9 % The following table outlines maturities of our lease liabilities as of June 30, 2021: (In millions) Year Ending June 30, Operating Leases Finance Leases 2022 $ 2,125 $ 1,179 2023 1,954 1,198 2024 1,751 1,211 2025 1,463 1,537 2026 1,133 1,220 Thereafter 4,111 8,856 Total lease payments 12,537 15,201 Less imputed interest ( 946 ) ( 2,660 ) Total $ 11,591 $ 12,541 As of June 30, 2021, we have additional operating and finance leases, primarily for datacenters, that have not yet commenced of $ 5.4 billion and $ 7.3 billion, respectively. These operating and finance leases will commence between fiscal year 2022 and fiscal year 2026 with lease terms of 1 year to 15 years . During fiscal year 2020, we recorded an impairment charge of $ 161 million to operating lease right-of-use assets due to the closing of our Microsoft Store physical locations. 87 PART II Item 8 NOTE 15 — CONTINGENCIES Patent and Intellectual Property Claims There were 63 patent infringement cases pending against Microsoft as of June 30, 2021, none of which are material individually or in aggregate. Antitrust, Unfair Competition, and Overcharge Class Actions Antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits were filed against us in British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec, Canada. All three have been certified on behalf of Canadian indirect purchasers who acquired licenses for Microsoft operating system software and/or productivity application software between 1998 and 2010. The trial of the British Columbia action commenced in May 2016. Following a mediation, the parties agreed to a global settlement of all three Canadian actions and submitted the proposed settlement agreement to the courts in all three jurisdictions for approval. The final settlement and form of notice have been approved by the courts in British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec. The ten-month claims period commenced on November 23, 2020 and will close on September 23, 2021. Other Antitrust Litigation and Claims China State Administration for Market Regulation Investigatio n In 2014, Microsoft was informed that China’s State Agency for Market Regulation (“SAMR”) (formerly State Administration for Industry and Commerce) had begun a formal investigation relating to China’s Anti-Monopoly Law, and the SAMR conducted onsite inspections of Microsoft offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chengdu. In 2019, the SAMR presented preliminary views as to certain possible violations of China’s Anti-Monopoly Law. Product-Related Litigation U.S. Cell Phone Litigation Microsoft Mobile Oy, a subsidiary of Microsoft, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in 46 lawsuits, including 45 lawsuits filed in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and other adverse health effects. We assumed responsibility for these claims in our agreement to acquire Nokia’s Devices and Services business and have been substituted for the Nokia defendants. Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the U.S. Federal Communications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines (“FCC Guidelines”) are pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines. In 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plaintiffs’ expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed scientific methodologies. In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motion to exclude the plaintiffs’ general causation experts. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence. In October 2016, the Court of Appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases to the trial court for further proceedings under that standard. The plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which the defendants have moved to strike. In August 2018, the trial court issued an order striking portions of the plaintiffs’ expert reports. A hearing on general causation is scheduled for January and February of 2022 . 88 PART II Item 8 Other Contingencies We also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. As of June 30, 2021, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $ 339 million. While we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $ 500 million in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable.

NOTE 19 — SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA In its operation of the business, management, including our chief operating decision maker, who is also our Chief Executive Officer, reviews certain financial information, including segmented internal profit and loss statements prepared on a basis not consistent with GAAP. During the periods presented, we reported our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing. Our reportable segments are described below. Productivity and Business Processes Our Productivity and Business Processes segment consists of products and services in our portfolio of productivity, communication, and information services, spanning a variety of devices and platforms. This segment primarily comprises: • Office Commercial (Office 365 subscriptions, the Office 365 portion of Microsoft 365 Commercial subscriptions, and Office licensed on-premises), comprising Office, Exchange, SharePoint, Microsoft Teams, Office 365 Security and Compliance, and Skype for Business. • Office Consumer, including Microsoft 365 Consumer subscriptions and Office licensed on-premises, and Office Consumer Services, including Skype, Outlook.com, and OneDrive. • LinkedIn, including Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, Premium Subscriptions, Sales Solutions, and Learning Solutions. • Dynamics business solutions, including Dynamics 365, comprising a set of intelligent, cloud-based applications across ERP, CRM, Customer Insights, Power Apps, and Power Automate; and on-premises ERP and CRM applications. Intelligent Cloud Our Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, private, and hybrid server products and cloud services that can power modern business and developers. This segment primarily comprises: • Server products and cloud services, including Azure; SQL Server, Windows Server, Visual Studio, System Center, and related Client Access Licenses (“CALs”); and GitHub. • Enterprise Services, including Premier Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services. More Personal Computing Our More Personal Computing segment consists of products and services that put customers at the center of the experience with our technology. This segment primarily comprises: • Windows, including Windows OEM licensing and other non-volume licensing of the Windows operating system; Windows Commercial, comprising volume licensing of the Windows operating system, Windows cloud services, and other Windows commercial offerings; patent licensing; Windows Internet of Things; and MSN advertising. • Devices, including Surface and PC accessories. 93 PART II Item 8 • Gaming, including Xbox hardware and Xbox content and services, comprising digital transactions, Xbox Game Pass and other subscriptions, video games, third-party video game royalties , cloud services, and advertising . • Search advertising. Revenue and costs are generally directly attributed to our segments. However, due to the integrated structure of our business, certain revenue recognized and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. Revenue from certain contracts is allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services, which can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit margin. Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative revenue methodology. Operating expenses that are allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple segments benefit and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin. In addition, certain costs incurred at a corporate level that are identifiable and that benefit our segments are allocated to them. These allocated costs include legal, including settlements and fines, information technology, human resources, finance, excise taxes, field selling, shared facilities services, and customer service and support. Each allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs being allocated. Certain corporate-level activity is not allocated to our segments. Segment revenue and operating income were as follows during the periods presented: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2021 2020 2019 Revenue Productivity and Business Processes $ 53,915 $ 46,398 $ 41,160 Intelligent Cloud 60,080 48,366 38,985 More Personal Computing 54,093 48,251 45,698 Total $ 168,088 $ 143,015 $ 125,843 Operating Income Productivity and Business Processes $ 24,351 $ 18,724 $ 16,219 Intelligent Cloud 26,126 18,324 13,920 More Personal Computing 19,439 15,911 12,820 Total $ 69,916 $ 52,959 $ 42,959 No sales to an individual customer or country other than the United States accounted for more than 10% of revenue for fiscal years 2021, 2020, or 2019. Revenue, classified by the major geographic areas in which our customers were located, was as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2021 2020 2019 United States (a) $ 83,953 $ 73,160 $ 64,199 Other countries 84,135 69,855 61,644 Total $ 168,088 $ 143,015 $ 125,843 (a) Includes billings to OEMs and certain multinational organizations because of the nature of these businesses and the impracticability of determining the geographic source of the revenue. 94 PART II Item 8 Revenue from external customers, classified by significant product and service offerings, was as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2021 2020 2019 Server products and cloud services $ 52,589 $ 41,379 $ 32,622 Office products and cloud services 39,872 35,316 31,769 Windows 23,227 22,294 20,395 Gaming 15,370 11,575 11,386 LinkedIn 10,289 8,077 6,754 Search advertising 8,528 7,740 7,628 Enterprise Services 6,943 6,409 6,124 Devices 6,791 6,457 6,095 Other 4,479 3,768 3,070 Total $ 168,088 $ 143,015 $ 125,843 Our commercial cloud revenue, which includes Azure, Office 365 Commercial, the commercial portion of LinkedIn, Dynamics 365, and other commercial cloud properties, was $ 69.1 billion, $ 51.7 billion and $ 38.1 billion in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. These amounts are primarily included in Server products and cloud services, Office products and cloud services, and LinkedIn in the table above. Assets are not allocated to segments for internal reporting presentations. A portion of amortization and depreciation is included with various other costs in an overhead allocation to each segment. It is impracticable for us to separately identify the amount of amortization and depreciation by segment that is included in the measure of segment profit or loss. Long-lived assets, excluding financial instruments and tax assets, classified by the location of the controlling statutory company and with countries over 10% of the total shown separately, were as follows: (In millions) June 30, 2021 2020 2019 United States $ 76,153 $ 60,789 $ 55,252 Ireland 13,303 12,734 12,958 Other countries 38,858 29,770 25,422 Total $ 128,314 $ 103,293 $ 93,632 95 PART II Item 8 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Microsoft Corporation Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries (the ""Company"") as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders' equity, for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the ""financial statements""). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated July 29, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 96 PART II Item 8 Revenue Recognition – Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. The Company offers customers the ability to acquire multiple licenses of software products and services, including cloud-based services, in its customer agreements through its volume licensing programs. Significant judgment is exercised by the Company in determining revenue recognition for these customer agreements, and includes the following: • Determination of whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together, such as software licenses and related services that are sold with cloud-based services. • The pattern of delivery (i.e., timing of when revenue is recognized) for each distinct performance obligation. • Identification and treatment of contract terms that may impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized (e.g., variable consideration, optional purchases, and free services). • Determination of stand-alone selling prices for each distinct performance obligation and for products and services that are not sold separately. Given these factors and due to the volume of transactions, the related audit effort in evaluating management's judgments in determining revenue recognition for these customer agreements was extensive and required a high degree of auditor judgment. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our principal audit procedures related to the Company's revenue recognition for these customer agreements included the following: • We tested the effectiveness of controls related to the identification of distinct performance obligations, the determination of the timing of revenue recognition, and the estimation of variable consideration. • We evaluated management's significant accounting policies related to these customer agreements for reasonableness. • We selected a sample of customer agreements and performed the following procedures: - Obtained and read contract source documents for each selection, including master agreements, and other documents that were part of the agreement. - Tested management's identification and treatment of contract terms. - Assessed the terms in the customer agreement and evaluated the appropriateness of management's application of their accounting policies, along with their use of estimates, in the determination of revenue recognition conclusions. • We evaluated the reasonableness of management's estimate of stand-alone selling prices for products and services that are not sold separately. • We tested the mathematical accuracy of management's calculations of revenue and the associated timing of revenue recognized in the financial statements. 97 PART II Item 8 Income Taxes – Uncertain Tax Positions – Refer to Note 12 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company's long-term income taxes liability includes uncertain tax positions related to transfer pricing issues that remain unresolved with the Internal Revenue Service (""IRS""). The Company remains under IRS audit, or subject to IRS audit, for tax years subsequent to 2003. While the Company has settled a portion of the IRS audits, resolution of the remaining matters could have a material impact on the Company's financial statements. Conclusions on recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions involve significant estimates and management judgment and include complex considerations of the Internal Revenue Code, related regulations, tax case laws, and prior-year audit settlements. Given the complexity and the subjective nature of the transfer pricing issues that remain unresolved with the IRS, evaluating management's estimates relating to their determination of uncertain tax positions required extensive audit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment, including involvement of our tax specialists. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our principal audit procedures to evaluate management's estimates of uncertain tax positions related to unresolved transfer pricing issues included the following: • We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management's methods and assumptions used in the identification, recognition, measurement, and disclosure of uncertain tax positions, which included testing the effectiveness of the related internal controls. • We read and evaluated management's documentation, including relevant accounting policies and information obtained by management from outside tax specialists, that detailed the basis of the uncertain tax positions. • We tested the reasonableness of management's judgments regarding the future resolution of the uncertain tax positions, including an evaluation of the technical merits of the uncertain tax positions. • For those uncertain tax positions that had not been effectively settled, we evaluated whether management had appropriately considered new information that could significantly change the recognition, measurement or disclosure of the uncertain tax positions. • We evaluated the reasonableness of management's estimates by considering how tax law, including statutes, regulations and case law, impacted management's judgments. /s/ D ELOITTE & T OUCHE LLP Seattle, Washington July 29, 2021 We have served as the Company's auditor since 1983. 98 PART II Item 9, 9A ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE Not applicable. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective. REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our consolidated financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected. Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2021. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Deloitte & Touche LLP has audited our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2021; their report is included in Item 9A. 99 PART II Item 9A REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Microsoft Corporation Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries (the ""Company"") as of June 30, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2021, based on the criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements and the related notes (collectively referred to as the ""financial statements"") as of and for the year ended June 30, 2021, of the Company and our report dated July 29, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ D ELOITTE & T OUCHE LLP Seattle, Washington July 29, 2021 100 PART II, III Item 9B, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 ITEM 9B.

BUSINESS GENERAL Embracing Our Future Microsoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. We strive to create local opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world. Our platforms and tools help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness, and public-sector efficiency. They also support new startups, improve educational and health outcomes, and empower human ingenuity. As the world responds to the outbreak of a novel strain of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”), we are working to do our part by ensuring the safety of our employees, striving to protect the health and well-being of the communities in which we operate, and providing technology and resources to our customers to help them do their best work while remote. We continue to transform our business to lead in the new era of the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge. We bring technology and products together into experiences and solutions that unlock value for our customers. Our unique role as a platform and tools provider allows us to connect the dots, bring together an ecosystem of partners, and enable organizations of all sizes to build the digital capability required to address these challenges. In this next phase of innovation, computing is more powerful and ubiquitous from the cloud to the edge. Artificial intelligence (“AI”) capabilities are rapidly advancing, fueled by data and knowledge of the world. Physical and virtual worlds are coming together with the Internet of Things (“IoT”) and mixed reality to create richer experiences that understand the context surrounding people, the things they use, the places they go, and their activities and relationships. A person’s experience with technology spans a multitude of devices and has become increasingly more natural and multi-sensory with voice, ink, and gaze interactions. What We Offer Founded in 1975, we develop and support software, services, devices, and solutions that deliver new value for customers and help people and businesses realize their full potential. We offer an array of services, including cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content, and we provide solution support and consulting services. We also deliver relevant online advertising to a global audience. Our products include operating systems; cross-device productivity applications; server applications; business solution applications; desktop and server management tools; software development tools; and video games. We also design, manufacture, and sell devices, including PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories. 3 PART I Item 1 The Ambitions That Drive Us To achieve our vision, our research and development efforts focus on three interconnected ambitions: • Reinvent productivity and business processes. • Build the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge platform. • Create more personal computing. Reinvent Productivity and Business Processes At Microsoft, we’re providing technology and resources to help our customers navigate a remote environment. We’re seeing our family of products play key roles in the ways the world is continuing to work, learn, and connect. Our growth depends on securely delivering continuous innovation and advancing our leading productivity and collaboration tools and services, including Office, Dynamics, and LinkedIn. Microsoft 365 brings together Office 365, Windows 10, and Enterprise Mobility + Security to help organizations empower their employees with AI-backed tools that unlock creativity, increase teamwork, and fuel innovation, all the while enabling compliance coverage and data protection. Microsoft Teams is enabling rapid digital transformation by giving people a single tool to chat, call, meet, and collaborate. Microsoft Relationship Sales solution brings together LinkedIn Sales Navigator and Dynamics to transform business to business sales through social selling. Dynamics 365 for Talent with LinkedIn Recruiter and Learning gives human resource professionals a complete solution to compete for talent. Microsoft Power Platform empowers employees to build custom applications, automate workflow, and analyze data no matter their technical expertise. These scenarios represent a move to unlock creativity and discover new habits, while simplifying security and management. Organizations of all sizes have digitized business-critical functions, redefining what they can expect from their business applications. This creates an opportunity to reach new customers and increase usage and engagement with existing customers. Build the Intelligent Cloud and Intelligent Edge Platform In the new remote world, companies have accelerated their own digital transformation to empower their employees, optimize their operations, engage customers, and in some cases, change the very core of their products and services. Partnering with organizations on their digital transformation during this period is one of our largest opportunities and we are uniquely positioned to become the strategic digital transformation platform and partner of choice; their success is our success. Our strategy requires continued investment in datacenters and other hybrid and edge infrastructure to support our services. Azure is a trusted cloud with comprehensive compliance coverage and AI-based security built in. Our cloud business benefits from three economies of scale: datacenters that deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones; datacenters that coordinate and aggregate diverse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns, improving the utilization of computing, storage, and network resources; and multi-tenancy locations that lower application maintenance labor costs. As one of the two largest providers of cloud computing at scale, we believe we work from a position of strength. Being a global-scale cloud, Azure uniquely offers hybrid consistency, developer productivity, AI capabilities, and trusted security and compliance. We see more emerging use cases and needs for compute and security at the edge and are accelerating our innovation across the spectrum of intelligent edge devices, from IoT sensors to gateway devices and edge hardware to build, manage, and secure edge workloads. With Azure Stack, organizations can extend Azure into their own datacenters to create a consistent stack across the public cloud and the intelligent edge. Our hybrid infrastructure consistency spans identity, data, compute, management, and security, helping to support the real-world needs and evolving regulatory requirements of commercial customers and enterprises. We are accelerating our development of mixed reality solutions with new Azure services and devices. The opportunity to merge the physical and digital worlds, when combined with the power of Azure cloud services, unlocks the potential for entirely new workloads which we believe will shape the next era of computing. 4 PART I Item 1 The ability to convert data into AI drives our competitive advantage. Azure SQL Database makes it possible for customers to take SQL Server from their on-premises datacenter to a fully managed instance in the cloud to utilize built-in AI. We are accelerating adoption of AI innovations from research to products. Our innovation helps every developer be an AI developer, with approachable new tools from Azure Machine Learning Studio for creating simple machine learning models, to the powerful Azure Machine Learning Workbench for the most advanced AI modeling and data science. Create More Personal Computing We strive to make computing more personal by putting users at the core of the experience, enabling them to interact with technology in more intuitive, engaging, and dynamic ways. In support of this, we are bringing Office, Windows, and devices together for an enhanced and more cohesive customer experience. Windows 10 serves the enterprise as the most secure and productive operating system. It empowers people with AI-first interfaces ranging from voice-activated commands through Cortana, inking, immersive 3D content storytelling, and mixed reality experiences. Our ambition for Windows 10 monetization opportunities includes gaming, services, subscriptions, and search advertising. Windows also plays a critical role in fueling our cloud business and Microsoft 365 strategy, and it powers the growing range of devices on the “intelligent edge.” We are committed to designing and marketing first-party devices to help drive innovation, create new device categories, and stimulate demand in the Windows ecosystem. We recently added several new products and accessories into the Surface family, including Surface Book 3 and Surface Go 2. These new Surface products join Surface Pro 7, Surface Laptop 3, and Surface Pro X. To expand usage and deepen engagement, we continue to invest in content, community, and cloud services as we pursue the expansive opportunity in the gaming industry. We are broadening our approach to how we think about gaming end-to-end, from the way games are created and distributed to how they are played and viewed across PC, console, and mobile. We have a strong position with our large and growing highly engaged community of gamers. Xbox Game Pass, with over 10 million members from 41 countries, is a community with access to a curated library of over 100 first- and third-party console and PC titles. Project xCloud is Microsoft’s game streaming technology that is complementary to our console hardware and will give fans the ultimate choice to play the games they want, with the people they want, on the devices they want. Our Future Opportunity In a time of great disruption and uncertainty, customers are looking to us to accelerate their own digital transformations as software and cloud computing play a huge role across every industry and around the world. We continue to develop complete, intelligent solutions for our customers that empower people to stay productive and collaborate, while safeguarding businesses and simplifying IT management. Our goal is to lead the industry in several distinct areas of technology over the long-term, which we expect will translate to sustained growth. We are investing significant resources in: • Transforming the workplace to deliver new modern, modular business applications to improve how people communicate, collaborate, learn, work, play, and interact with one another. • Building and running cloud-based services in ways that unleash new experiences and opportunities for businesses and individuals. • Applying AI to drive insights and act on our customer’s behalf by understanding and interpreting their needs using natural methods of communication. • Using Windows to fuel our cloud business and Microsoft 365 strategy, and to develop new categories of devices – both our own and third-party – on the intelligent edge. • Inventing new gaming experiences that bring people together around their shared love for games on any devices and pushing the boundaries of innovation with console and PC gaming by creating the next wave of entertainment. Our future growth depends on our ability to transcend current product category definitions, business models, and sales motions. We have the opportunity to redefine what customers and partners can expect and are working to deliver new solutions that reflect the best of Microsoft. 5 PART I Item 1 COVID-19 In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 to be a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is having widespread, rapidly evolving, and unpredictable impacts on global society, economies, financial markets, and business practices. Federal and state governments have implemented measures in an effort to contain the virus, including social distancing, travel restrictions, border closures, limitations on public gatherings, work from home, supply chain logistical changes, and closure of non-essential businesses. To protect the health and well-being of our employees, suppliers, and customers, we have made substantial modifications to employee travel policies, implemented office closures as employees are advised to work from home, and cancelled or shifted our conferences and other marketing events to virtual-only through fiscal year 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and may continue to impact our business operations, including our employees, customers, partners, and communities, and there is substantial uncertainty in the nature and degree of its continued effects over time. Refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion regarding the impact of COVID-19 on our fiscal year 2020 financial results. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business going forward will depend on numerous evolving factors we cannot reliably predict, including the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business, and individuals' actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity including the possibility of recession or financial market instability. These factors may adversely impact consumer, business, and government spending on technology as well as customers' ability to pay for our products and services on an ongoing basis. This uncertainty also affects management’s accounting estimates and assumptions, which could result in greater variability in a variety of areas that depend on these estimates and assumptions, including investments, receivables, and forward-looking guidance. Refer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) for a discussion of these factors and other risks. Commitment to Sustainability We work to ensure that technology is inclusive, trusted, and increases sustainability. We’re empowering our customers and partners with new technology to help them drive efficiencies, transform their businesses, and create their own solutions for sustainability. In January 2020, we announced a bold new environmental sustainability strategy focused on carbon, water, waste, and ecosystems. As part of our commitment, we are investing $1 billion over the next four years in new technologies and innovative climate solutions. We set an ambitious goal to reduce and ultimately remove Microsoft’s carbon footprint. By 2030 Microsoft will be carbon negative, and by 2050 Microsoft will remove from the environment all the carbon the company has emitted directly or by electrical consumption since it was founded in 1975. We also launched a new initiative to use Microsoft technology to help our suppliers and customers around the world reduce their own carbon footprint. The investments we make in sustainability carry through to our products, services, and devices. We design our devices, from Surface to Xbox, to minimize their impact on the environment. Our cloud and AI services help businesses cut energy consumption, reduce physical footprints, and design sustainable products. We also pledged a $50 million investment in AI for Earth to accelerate innovation by putting AI in the hands of those working to directly address sustainability challenges. Lastly, this work is supported by using our voice to support policies we think can advance sustainability efforts. Addressing Racial Injustice Our future opportunity depends on reaching and empowering all communities, and we are committed to taking action to help address racial injustice and inequity. With significant input from employees and leaders who are members of the Black and African American community, our senior leadership team and board of directors has developed a set of actions to help improve the lived experience at Microsoft and drive change in the communities in which we live and work. These efforts include increasing our representation and culture of inclusion by doubling the number of Black and African American people managers, senior individual contributors, and senior leaders in the United States by 2025; engaging our ecosystem by using our balance sheet and engagement with suppliers and partners to extend the vision for societal change; and strengthening our communities by using the power of data, technology, and partnership to help improve the lives of Black and African American citizens across the United States. 6 PART I Item 1 Investing in Digital Skills With a continued focus on digital transformation, Microsoft is making efforts to help ensure that no one is left behind, particularly as economies start to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. We are expanding access to the digital skills that have become increasingly vital to many of the world’s jobs, and especially to individuals hardest hit by recent job losses, including those with lower incomes, women, and underrepresented minorities. Our skills initiative brings together learning resources, certification opportunities, and job-seeker tools from LinkedIn, GitHub, and Microsoft Learn, and is built on data insights drawn from LinkedIn’s Economic Graph. This is combined with $20 million we are investing in key non-profit partnerships through Microsoft Philanthropies. OPERATING SEGMENTS We operate our business and report our financial performance using three segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing. Our segments provide management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. The segments enable the alignment of strategies and objectives across the development, sales, marketing, and services organizations, and they provide a framework for timely and rational allocation of resources within businesses. Additional information on our operating segments and geographic and product information is contained in Note 19 – Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). Our reportable segments are described below.

Office Consumer Services revenue is mainly affected by the demand for communication and storage through Skype, Outlook.com, and OneDrive, which is largely driven by subscriptions, advertising, and the sale of minutes. LinkedIn LinkedIn connects the world’s professionals to make them more productive and successful and transforms the way companies hire, market, sell, and learn. Our vision is to create economic opportunity for every member of the global workforce through the ongoing development of the world’s first Economic Graph, a digital representation of the global economy. In addition to LinkedIn’s free services, LinkedIn offers monetized solutions: Talent Solutions, Learning Solutions, Marketing Solutions, Sales Solutions, and Premium Subscriptions. Talent Solutions provide insights for workforce planning and tools to hire, nurture, and develop talent. Learning Solutions, including Glint, help businesses close critical skills gaps in times where companies are having to do more with existing talent. Marketing Solutions help companies grow relationships between businesses. Sales Solutions help companies strengthen customer relationships, empower teams with digital selling tools, and acquire new opportunities. Finally, Premium Subscriptions enables professionals to manage their professional identity, grow their network, and connect with talent through additional services like premium search. LinkedIn has over 700 million members and has offices around the globe. Growth will depend on our ability to increase the number of LinkedIn members and our ability to continue offering services that provide value for our members and increase their engagement. LinkedIn revenue is mainly affected by demand from enterprises and professional organizations for subscriptions to Talent Solutions , Learning Solutions, Sales Solutions, and Premium Subscriptions offerings, as well as member engagement and the quality of the sponsored content delivered to those members to drive Marketing Solutions. Dynamics Dynamics provides cloud-based and on-premises business solutions for financial management, enterprise resource planning (“ERP”), customer relationship management (“CRM”), supply chain management, and other application development platforms for small and medium businesses, large organizations, and divisions of global enterprises. Dynamics revenue is driven by the number of users licensed, expansion of average revenue per user, and the continued shift to Dynamics 365, a unified set of cloud-based intelligent business applications. Competition Competitors to Office include software and global application vendors, such as Apple, Cisco Systems, Facebook, Google, IBM, Okta, Proofpoint, Slack, Symantec, Zoom, and numerous web-based and mobile application competitors as well as local application developers. Apple distributes versions of its pre-installed application software, such as email and calendar products, through its PCs, tablets, and phones. Cisco Systems is using its position in enterprise communications equipment to grow its unified communications business. Google provides a hosted messaging and productivity suite. Slack provides teamwork and collaboration software. Zoom offers videoconferencing and cloud phone solutions. Skype for Business and Skype also compete with a variety of instant messaging, voice, and video communication providers, ranging from start-ups to established enterprises. Okta, Proofpoint, and Symantec provide security solutions across email security, information protection, identity, and governance. Web-based offerings competing with individual applications have also positioned themselves as alternatives to our products and services. We compete by providing powerful, flexible, secure, integrated industry-specific, and easy-to-use productivity and collaboration tools and services that create comprehensive solutions and work well with technologies our customers already have both on-premises or in the cloud. LinkedIn faces competition from online professional networks, recruiting companies, talent management companies, and larger companies that are focusing on talent management and human resource services; job boards; traditional recruiting firms; and companies that provide learning and development products and services. Marketing Solutions competes with online and offline outlets that generate revenue from advertisers and marketers, and Sales Solutions competes with online and offline outlets for companies with lead generation and customer intelligence and insights. 8 PART I Item 1 Dynamics competes with vendors such as Oracle, Salesforce.com, and SAP to provide cloud-based and on-premise s business solutions for small, medium, and large organizations. Intelligent Cloud Our Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, private, and hybrid server products and cloud services that can power modern business and developers. This segment primarily comprises: • Server products and cloud services, including Azure; SQL Server, Windows Server, Visual Studio, System Center, and related CALs; and GitHub. • Enterprise Services, including Premier Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services. Server Products and Cloud Services Azure is a comprehensive set of cloud services that offer developers, IT professionals, and enterprises freedom to build, deploy, and manage applications on any platform or device. Customers can use Azure through our global network of datacenters for computing, networking, storage, mobile and web application services, AI, IoT, cognitive services, and machine learning. Azure enables customers to devote more resources to development and use of applications that benefit their organizations, rather than managing on-premises hardware and software. Azure revenue is mainly affected by infrastructure-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service consumption-based services, and per user-based services such as Enterprise Mobility + Security. Our server products are designed to make IT professionals, developers, and their systems more productive and efficient. Server software is integrated server infrastructure and middleware designed to support software applications built on the Windows Server operating system. This includes the server platform, database, business intelligence, storage, management and operations, virtualization, service-oriented architecture platform, security, and identity software. We also license standalone and software development lifecycle tools for software architects, developers, testers, and project managers. GitHub provides a collaboration platform and code hosting service for developers. Server products revenue is mainly affected by purchases through volume licensing programs, licenses sold to original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”), and retail packaged products. CALs provide access rights to certain server products, including SQL Server and Windows Server, and revenue is reported along with the associated server product. Enterprise Services Enterprise Services, including Premier Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services, assist customers in developing, deploying, and managing Microsoft server and desktop solutions and provide training and certification to developers and IT professionals on various Microsoft products. Competition Azure faces diverse competition from companies such as Amazon, Google, IBM, Oracle, VMware, and open source offerings. Our Enterprise Mobility + Security offerings also compete with products from a range of competitors including identity vendors, security solution vendors, and numerous other security point solution vendors. Azure’s competitive advantage includes enabling a hybrid cloud, allowing deployment of existing datacenters with our public cloud into a single, cohesive infrastructure, and the ability to run at a scale that meets the needs of businesses of all sizes and complexities. We believe our cloud’s global scale, coupled with our broad portfolio of identity and security solutions, allows us to effectively solve complex cybersecurity challenges for our customers and differentiates us from the competition. Our server products face competition from a wide variety of server operating systems and applications offered by companies with a range of market approaches. Vertically integrated computer manufacturers such as Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and Oracle offer their own versions of the Unix operating system preinstalled on server hardware. Nearly all computer manufacturers offer server hardware for the Linux operating system and many contribute to Linux operating system development. The competitive position of Linux has also benefited from the large number of compatible applications now produced by many commercial and non-commercial software developers. A number of companies, such as Red Hat, supply versions of Linux. 9 PART I Item 1 We compete to provide enterprise-wide computing solutions and point solutions with numerous commercial software vendors that offer solutions and middleware technology platforms, software applications for connectivity (both Internet and intranet), security, hosting, database, and e-business servers. IBM and Oracle lead a group of companies focused on the Java Platform Enterprise Edition that competes with our enterprise-wide computing solutions. Commercial competitors for our server applications for PC-based distributed client-server environments include CA Technologies, IBM, and Oracle. Our web application platform software competes with open source software such as Apache, Linux, MySQL, and PHP. In middleware, we compete against Java vendors. Our database, business intelligence, and data warehousing solutions offerings compete with products from IBM, Oracle, SAP, and other companies. Our system management solutions compete with server management and server virtualization platform providers, such as BMC, CA Technologies, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and VMware. Our products for software developers compete against offerings from Adobe, IBM, Oracle, and other companies, and also against open-source projects, including Eclipse (sponsored by CA Technologies, IBM, Oracle, and SAP), PHP, and Ruby on Rails. We believe our server products provide customers with advantages in performance, total costs of ownership, and productivity by delivering superior applications, development tools, compatibility with a broad base of hardware and software applications, security, and manageability. Our Enterprise Services business competes with a wide range of companies that provide strategy and business planning, application development, and infrastructure services, including multinational consulting firms and small niche businesses focused on specific technologies. More Personal Computing Our More Personal Computing segment consists of products and services that put customers at the center of the experience with our technology. This segment primarily comprises: • Windows, including Windows OEM licensing (“Windows OEM”) and other non-volume licensing of the Windows operating system; Windows Commercial, comprising volume licensing of the Windows operating system, Windows cloud services, and other Windows commercial offerings; patent licensing; Windows IoT; and MSN advertising. • Devices, including Surface and PC accessories. • Gaming, including Xbox hardware and Xbox content and services, comprising Xbox Live (transactions, subscriptions, cloud services, and advertising), video games, and third-party video game royalties. • Search. Windows The Windows operating system is designed to deliver a more personal computing experience for users by enabling consistency of experience, applications, and information across their devices. Windows OEM revenue is impacted significantly by the number of Windows operating system licenses purchased by OEMs, which they pre-install on the devices they sell. In addition to computing device market volume, Windows OEM revenue is impacted by: • The mix of computing devices based on form factor and screen size. • Differences in device market demand between developed markets and growth markets. • Attachment of Windows to devices shipped. • Customer mix between consumer, small and medium businesses, and large enterprises. • Changes in inventory levels in the OEM channel. • Pricing changes and promotions, pricing variation that occurs when the mix of devices manufactured shifts from local and regional system builders to large multinational OEMs, and different pricing of Windows versions licensed. • Constraints in the supply chain of device components. • Piracy. 10 PART I Item 1 Windows Commercial revenue, which includes volume licensing of the Windows operating system and Windows cloud services such as Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection, is affected mainly by the demand from commercial customers for volume licensing and Software Assurance (“SA”), as well as advanced security offerings. Windows Commercial revenue often reflects the number of information workers in a licensed enterprise and is relatively independent of the number of PCs sold in a given year. Patent licensing includes our programs to license patents we own for use across a broad array of technology areas, including mobile devices and cloud offerings. Windows IoT extends the power of Windows and the cloud to intelligent systems by delivering specialized operating systems, tools, and services for use in embedded devices. MSN advertising includes both native and display ads. Devices We design, manufacture, and sell devices, including Surface and PC accessories. Our devices are designed to enable people and organizations to connect to the people and content that matter most using Windows and integrated Microsoft products and services. Surface is designed to help organizations, students, and consumers be more productive. Growth in Devices is dependent on total PC shipments, the ability to attract new customers, our product roadmap, and expanding into new categories. Gaming Our gaming platform is designed to provide a variety of entertainment through a unique combination of content, community, and cloud. Our exclusive game content is created through Xbox Game Studios, a collection of first-party studios creating iconic and differentiated gaming experiences. We continue to invest in new gaming studios and content to expand our IP roadmap and leverage new content creators. These unique gaming experiences are the cornerstone of Xbox Game Pass, a subscription service and gaming community with access to a curated library of over 100 first- and third-party console and PC titles. The gamer remains at the heart of the Xbox ecosystem. We continue to open new opportunities for gamers to engage both on- and off-console with both the launch of Project xCloud, our game streaming service, and continued investment in gaming hardware. Project xCloud utilizes Microsoft’s Azure cloud technology to allow direct and on-demand streaming of games to PCs, consoles, and mobile devices, enabling gamers to take their favorites games with them and play on the device most convenient to them. Project xCloud will provide players with more choice over how and where they play. Xbox Live enables people to connect and share online gaming experiences and is accessible on Xbox consoles, Windows-enabled devices, and other devices. Xbox Live is designed to benefit users by providing access to a network of certified applications and services and to benefit our developer and partner ecosystems by providing access to a large customer base. Xbox revenue is mainly affected by subscriptions and sales of first- and third-party content, as well as advertising. Growth of our Gaming business is determined by the overall active user base through Xbox enabled content, availability of games, providing exclusive game content that gamers seek, the computational power and reliability of the devices used to access our content and services, and the ability to create new experiences through first-party content creators. Search Our Search business, including Bing and Microsoft Advertising, is designed to deliver relevant online advertising to a global audience. We have several partnerships with other companies, including Verizon Media Group, through which we provide and monetize search queries. Growth depends on our ability to attract new users, understand intent, and match intent with relevant content and advertiser offerings. Competition Windows faces competition from various software products and from alternative platforms and devices, mainly from Apple and Google. We believe Windows competes effectively by giving customers choice, value, flexibility, security, an easy-to-use interface, and compatibility with a broad range of hardware and software applications, including those that enable productivity. 11 PART I Item 1 Devices face competition from various computer, tablet, and hardware manufacturers who offer a unique combination of high-quality industrial design and innovative technologies across various price points. These manufacturers, many of which are also current or potential partners and customers, include Apple and our Windows OEMs. Xbox Live and our cloud gaming services face competition from various online gaming ecosystems and game streaming services, including those operated by Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Tencent. We also compete with other providers of entertainment services such as Netflix and Hulu. Our gaming platform competes with console platforms from Nintendo and Sony, both of which have a large, established base of customers. We believe our gaming platform is effectively positioned against, and uniquely differentiated from, competitive products and services based on significant innovation in hardware architecture, user interface, developer tools, online gaming and entertainment services, and continued strong exclusive content from our own first-party game franchises as well as other digital content offerings. Our search business competes with Google and a wide array of websites, social platforms like Facebook, and portals that provide content and online offerings to end users. OPERATIONS We have operations centers that support operations in their regions, including customer contract and order processing, credit and collections, information processing, and vendor management and logistics. The regional center in Ireland supports the European, Middle Eastern, and African region; the center in Singapore supports the Japan, India, Greater China, and Asia-Pacific region; and the centers in Fargo, North Dakota, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Puerto Rico, Redmond, Washington, and Reno, Nevada support Latin America and North America. In addition to the operations centers, we also operate datacenters throughout the Americas, Europe, Australia, and Asia, as well as in the Middle East and Africa. To serve the needs of customers around the world and to improve the quality and usability of products in international markets, we localize many of our products to reflect local languages and conventions. Localizing a product may require modifying the user interface, altering dialog boxes, and translating text. Our devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. We generally have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. The majority of our hardware products contain components for which there is only one qualified supplier. Extended disruptions at these suppliers could lead to a similar disruption in our ability to manufacture devices. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Product and Service Development, and Intellectual Property We develop most of our products and services internally through the following engineering groups. • Cloud and AI , focuses on making IT professionals, developers, and their systems more productive and efficient through development of cloud infrastructure, server, database, CRM, ERP, management and development tools, AI cognitive services, and other business process applications and services for enterprises. • Experiences and Devices , focuses on instilling a unifying product ethos across our end-user experiences and devices, including Office, Windows, Enterprise Mobility + Security, and Surface. • AI and Research , focuses on our AI innovations and other forward-looking research and development efforts spanning infrastructure, services, applications, and search. • LinkedIn , focuses on our services that transform the way customers hire, market, sell, and learn. • Gaming , focuses on developing hardware, content, and services across a large range of platforms to help grow our user base through game experiences and social interaction. 12 PART I Item 1 Internal development allows us to maintain competitive advantages that come from product differentiation and closer technical control over our products and services. It also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented. We strive to obtain information as early as possible about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software and hardware design. Before releasing new software platforms, and as we make significant modifications to existing platforms, we provide application vendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development, training, and testing. Generally, we also create product documentation internally. We protect our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways. We work actively in the U.S. and internationally to ensure the enforcement of copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other protections that apply to our software and hardware products, services, business plans, and branding. We are a leader among technology companies in pursuing patents and currently have a portfolio of over 63,000 U.S. and international patents issued and over 24,500 pending worldwide. While we employ much of our internally-developed intellectual property exclusively in our products and services, we also engage in outbound licensing of specific patented technologies that are incorporated into licensees’ products. From time to time, we enter into broader cross-license agreements with other technology companies covering entire groups of patents. We also purchase or license technology that we incorporate into our products and services. At times, we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective, such as promoting industry standards, advancing interoperability, or attracting and enabling our external development community. Our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products, services, and business methods, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. We believe our continuing research and product development are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products. Investing in the Future Our success is based on our ability to create new and compelling products, services, and experiences for our users, to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new geographic and product markets, and to drive broad adoption of our products and services. We invest in a range of emerging technology trends and breakthroughs that we believe offer significant opportunities to deliver value to our customers and growth for the Company. Based on our assessment of key technology trends, we maintain our long-term commitment to research and development across a wide spectrum of technologies, tools, and platforms spanning digital work and life experiences, cloud computing, AI, devices, and operating systems. While our main product research and development facilities are located in Redmond, Washington, we also operate research and development facilities in other parts of the U.S. and around the world, including Canada, China, Czech Republic, India, Ireland, Israel, and the United Kingdom. This global approach helps us remain competitive in local markets and enables us to continue to attract top talent from across the world. In addition to our main research and development operations, we also operate Microsoft Research. Microsoft Research is one of the world’s largest corporate research organizations and works in close collaboration with top universities around the world to advance the state-of-the-art in computer science and a broad range of other disciplines, providing us a unique perspective on future trends and contributing to our innovation. We generally fund research at the corporate level to ensure that we are looking beyond immediate product considerations to opportunities further in the future. We also fund research and development activities at the operating segment level. Much of our segment level research and development is coordinated with other segments and leveraged across the Company. We plan to continue to make significant investments in a broad range of research and development efforts. 13 PART I Item 1 DISTRIBUTION, SALES, AND MARKETING We market and distribute our products and services through the following channels: OEMs, direct, and distributors and resellers. Our sales force performs a variety of functions, including working directly with commercial enterprises and public-sector organizations worldwide to identify and meet their technology and digital transformation requirements; managing OEM relationships; and supporting system integrators, independent software vendors, and other partners who engage directly with our customers to perform sales, consulting, and fulfillment functions for our products and services. OEMs We distribute our products and services through OEMs that pre-install our software on new devices and servers they sell. The largest component of the OEM business is the Windows operating system pre-installed on devices. OEMs also sell devices pre-installed with other Microsoft products and services, including applications such as Office and the capability to subscribe to Office 365. There are two broad categories of OEMs. The largest category of OEMs are direct OEMs as our relationship with them is managed through a direct agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all the multinational OEMs, including Acer, ASUS, Dell, Fujitsu, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, Samsung, Sharp, Toshiba, and with many regional and local OEMs. The second broad category of OEMs are system builders consisting of lower-volume PC manufacturers, which source Microsoft software for pre-installation and local redistribution primarily through the Microsoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft. Direct Many organizations that license our products and services transact directly with us through Enterprise Agreements and Enterprise Services contracts, with sales support from system integrators, independent software vendors, web agencies, and partners that advise organizations on licensing our products and services (“Enterprise Agreement Software Advisors” or “ESA”). Microsoft offers direct sales programs targeted to reach small, medium, and corporate customers, in addition to those offered through the reseller channel. A large network of partner advisors support many of these sales. We also sell commercial and consumer products and services directly to customers, such as cloud services, search, and gaming, through our digital marketplaces and online stores. In June 2020, we announced a strategic change in our retail operations, including closing our Microsoft Store physical locations. Distributors and Resellers Organizations also license our products and services indirectly, primarily through licensing solution partners (“LSP”), distributors, value-added resellers (“VAR”), and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner may reach organizations of all sizes, LSPs are primarily engaged with large organizations, distributors resell primarily to VARs, and VARs typically reach small and medium organizations. ESAs are also typically authorized as LSPs and operate as resellers for our other volume licensing programs. Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider is our main partner program for reselling cloud services. We distribute our retail packaged products primarily through independent non-exclusive distributors, authorized replicators, resellers, and retail outlets. Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets. We distribute our devices through third-party retailers. We have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers, and provide product training and sales support. Our Dynamics business solutions are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and specialized services. 14 PART I Item 1 LICENSING OPTIONS We offer options for organizations that want to purchase our cloud services, on-premises software, and Software Assurance. We license software to organizations under volume licensing agreements to allow the customer to acquire multiple licenses of products and services instead of having to acquire separate licenses through retail channels. We use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations of various sizes. While these programs may differ in various parts of the world, generally they include those discussed below. SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades for perpetual licenses released over the contract period. It also provides support, tools, training, and other licensing benefits to help customers deploy and use software efficiently. SA is included with certain volume licensing agreements and is an optional purchase with others. Volume Licensing Programs Enterprise Agreement Enterprise Agreements offer large organizations a manageable volume licensing program that gives them the flexibility to buy cloud services and software licenses under one agreement. Enterprise Agreements are designed for medium or large organizations that want to license cloud services and on-premises software organization-wide over a three-year period. Organizations can elect to purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses. SA is included. Microsoft Product and Services Agreement Microsoft Product and Services Agreements are designed for medium and large organizations that want to license cloud services and on-premises software as needed, with no organization-wide commitment, under a single, non-expiring agreement. Organizations purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses. SA is optional for customers that purchase perpetual licenses. Open Open agreements are a simple, cost-effective way to acquire the latest Microsoft technology. Open agreements are designed for small and medium organizations that want to license cloud services and on-premises software over a one- to three-year period. Under the Open agreements, organizations purchase perpetual licenses and SA is optional. Under Open Value agreements, organizations can elect to purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses and SA is included. Select Plus Select Plus agreements are designed for government and academic organizations to acquire on-premises licenses at any affiliate or department level, while realizing advantages as one organization. Organizations purchase perpetual licenses and SA is optional. Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement Microsoft Online Subscription Agreements are designed for small and medium organizations that want to subscribe to, activate, provision, and maintain cloud services seamlessly and directly via the web. The agreement allows customers to acquire monthly or annual subscriptions for cloud-based services. Partner Programs The Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider program offers customers an easy way to license the cloud services they need in combination with the value-added services offered by their systems integrator, managed services provider, or cloud reseller partner. Partners in this program can easily package their own products and services to directly provision, manage, and support their customer subscriptions. The Microsoft Services Provider License Agreement allows hosting service providers and independent software vendors who want to license eligible Microsoft software products to provide software services and hosted applications to their end customers. Partners license software over a three-year period and are billed monthly based on consumption. 15 PART I Item 1 The Independent Software Vendor Royalty program enables partners to integrate Microsoft products into other applications and then license the unified business solution to their end users. CUSTOMERS Our customers include individual consumers, small and medium organizations, large global enterprises, public-sector institutions, Internet service providers, application developers, and OEMs. Our practice is to ship our products promptly upon receipt of purchase orders from customers; consequently, backlog is not significant. 16 PART I Item 1 EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT Our executive officers as of July 30, 2020 were as follows: Name Age Position with the Company Satya Nadella 52 Chief Executive Officer Christopher C.

RISK FACTORS Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock. We face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins. Competition in the technology sector Our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small, specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical, marketing, and financial resources. Barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products, devices, and services that appeal to businesses and consumers. Competition among platform-based ecosystems An important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions. A well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users, application developers, and the platform provider that can accelerate growth. Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins. We face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms. • A competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements of a product and related services, has succeeded with some consumer products such as personal computers, tablets, phones, gaming consoles, wearables, and other endpoint devices. Competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform, including applications and content sold through their integrated marketplaces. They may also be able to claim security and performance benefits from their vertically integrated offer. We also offer some vertically-integrated hardware and software products and services. To the extent we shift a portion of our business to a vertically integrated model we increase our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margins. • We derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on PCs. We face significant competition from competing platforms developed for new devices and form factors such as smartphones and tablet computers. These devices compete on multiple bases including price and the perceived utility of the device and its platform. Users are increasingly turning to these devices to perform functions that in the past were performed by personal computers. Even if many users view these devices as complementary to a personal computer, the prevalence of these devices may make it more difficult to attract application developers to our PC operating system platforms. Competing with operating systems licensed at low or no cost may decrease our PC operating system margins. Popular products or services offered on competing platforms could increase their competitive strength. In addition, some of our devices compete with products made by our original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) partners, which may affect their commitment to our platform. • Competing platforms have content and application marketplaces with scale and significant installed bases. The variety and utility of content and applications available on a platform are important to device purchasing decisions. Users may incur costs to move data and buy new content and applications when switching platforms. To compete, we must successfully enlist developers to write applications for our platform and ensure that these applications have high quality, security, customer appeal, and value. Efforts to compete with competitors’ content and application marketplaces may increase our cost of revenue and lower our operating margins. Competitors’ rules governing their content and applications marketplaces may restrict our ability to distribute products and services through them in accordance with our technical and business model objectives. 19 PART I Item 1A Business model competition Companies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models. • Even as we transition more of our business to infrastructure-, platform-, and software-as-a-service business model, the license-based proprietary software model generates a substantial portion of our software revenue. We bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenue received from licensing our products. Many of our competitors also develop and sell software to businesses and consumers under this model. • Other competitors develop and offer free applications, online services and content, and make money by selling third-party advertising. Advertising revenue funds development of products and services these competitors provide to users at no or little cost, competing directly with our revenue-generating products. • Some companies compete with us by modifying and then distributing open source software at little or no cost to end users, and earning revenue on advertising or integrated products and services. These firms do not bear the full costs of research and development for the open source software. Some open source software mimics the features and functionality of our products. The competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for research and development, marketing, and sales incentives. This may lead to lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income. Our increasing focus on cloud-based services presents execution and competitive risks. A growing part of our business involves cloud-based services available across the spectrum of computing devices. Our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building best-in-class platforms and productivity services for an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with artificial intelligence (“AI”). At the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and business customers. Pricing and delivery models are evolving. Devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user’s choice of which cloud-based services to use. We are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies. The Windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment. We are undertaking cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation. Our intelligent cloud and intelligent edge worldview is connected with the growth of the Internet of Things (“IoT”). Our success in the IoT will depend on the level of adoption of our offerings such as Azure, Azure Stack, Azure IoT Edge, and Azure Sphere. We may not establish market share sufficient to achieve scale necessary to achieve our business objectives. Besides software development costs, we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services. These costs will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved. Whether we succeed in cloud-based services depends on our execution in several areas, including: • Continuing to bring to market compelling cloud-based experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share. • Maintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance of our cloud-based services on the growing array of computing devices, including PCs, smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, and other devices, as well as sensors and other endpoints. • Continuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third-party developers. • Ensuring our cloud-based services meet the reliability expectations of our customers and maintain the security of their data as well as help them meet their own compliance needs. • Making our suite of cloud-based services platform-agnostic, available on a wide range of devices and ecosystems, including those of our competitors. It is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed. If we are not effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services, we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above. This may negatively impact gross margins and operating income. 20 PART I Item 1A We make significant investments in products and services that may not achieve expected returns. We will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the Windows operating system, Microsoft 365, Office, Bing, SQL Server, Windows Server, Azure, Office 365, Xbox Live, LinkedIn, and other products and services. We also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment including PCs, tablets, gaming devices, and HoloLens. Investments in new technology are speculative. Commercial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their purchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. We may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. New products and services may not be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically. We may not get engagement in certain features, like Edge and Bing, that drive post-sale monetization opportunities. Our data handling practices across our products and services will continue to be under scrutiny and perceptions of mismanagement, driven by regulatory activity or negative public reaction to our practices or product experiences, which could negatively impact product and feature adoption, product design, and product quality. Developing new technologies is complex. It can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue. Acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business. We expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. For example, in October 2018, we completed our acquisition of GitHub, Inc. (“GitHub”) for $7.5 billion. These acquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks, including that they do not advance our business strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment, that we have difficulty integrating and retaining new employees, business systems, and technology, or that they distract management from our other businesses. If an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party, it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement. The success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones. It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements such as increased revenue or enhanced efficiencies, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected. These events could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements. If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings. We acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. We review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate. We have in the past recorded, and may in the future be required to record a significant charge in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively affecting our results of operations. 21 PART I Item 1A Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our reputation or competitive position. Security of our information technology Threats to IT security can take a variety of forms. Individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including state-sponsored organizations or nation-states, continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our IT. These actors may use a wide variety of methods, which may include developing and deploying malicious software or exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware, software, or other infrastructure in order to attack our products and services or gain access to our networks and datacenters, using social engineering techniques to induce our employees, users, partners, or customers to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users’ or customers’ data, or acting in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks. Inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access to confidential data. For example, system administrators may fail to timely remove employee account access when no longer appropriate. Employees or third parties may intentionally compromise our or our users’ security or systems, or reveal confidential information. Cyberthreats are constantly evolving, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. We may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities, which may allow them to persist in the environment over long periods of time. Cyberthreats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and customers. Breaches of our facilities, network, or data security could disrupt the security of our systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in product development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies, or otherwise adversely affect our business. In addition, our internal IT environment continues to evolve. Often, we are early adopters of new devices and technologies. We embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies. Our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge. Security of our products, services, devices, and customers’ data The security of our products and services is important in our customers’ decisions to purchase or use our products or services. Security threats are a significant challenge to companies like us whose business is providing technology products and services to others. Threats to our own IT infrastructure can also affect our customers. Customers using our cloud-based services rely on the security of our infrastructure, including hardware and other elements provided by third parties, to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data. Adversaries tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and services, including many of ours, and we expect that to continue. Adversaries that acquire user account information at other companies can use that information to compromise our users’ accounts where accounts share the same attributes as passwords. Inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access. User activity may also result in ransomware or other malicious software impacting a customer’s use of our products or services. We are also increasingly incorporating open source software into our products. There may be vulnerabilities in open source software that may make our products susceptible to cyberattacks. To defend against security threats to our internal IT systems, our cloud-based services, and our customers’ systems, we must continuously engineer more secure products and services, enhance security and reliability features, improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities in our own products as well as those provided by others, develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network, products, and services, and provide security tools such as firewalls and anti-virus software and information about the need to deploy security measures and the impact of doing so. Customers in certain industries such as financial services, health care, and government may have enhanced or specialized requirements to which we must engineer our product and services. 22 PART I Item 1A The cost of these steps could reduce our operating margins. If we fail to do these things well, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services, data corruption issues, or reduced performance could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future purchases of products or subscriptions to services, or to use competing products or services. Customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional products or services. Customers, and third parties granted access to their systems, may fail to update their systems, continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support, or may fail timely to install or enable security patches, or may otherwise fail to adopt adequate security practices. Any of these could adversely affect our reputation and revenue. Actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us. Our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, but there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges. At times, to achieve commercial objectives, we may enter into agreements with larger liability exposure to customers. Our products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem of third parties. If there is a security vulnerability in one of these components, and if there is a security exploit targeting it, we could face increased costs, liability claims, reduced revenue, or harm to our reputation or competitive position. Disclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation. As we continue to grow the number and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers and users. The continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. Despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and third parties on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure or misuse of customer or user data we or our vendors store and manage. In addition, third parties who have limited access to our customer or user data may use this data in unauthorized ways. Improper disclosure or misuse could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers or users, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Our software products and services also enable our customers and users to store and process personal data on-premises or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment we host. Government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer or user data in response to valid legal orders. In the U.S. and elsewhere, we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure. Despite our efforts to protect customer and user data, perceptions that the collection, use, and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services, and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities. Additional security measures we may take to address customer or user concerns, or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer or user expectations or governmental rules or actions, may cause higher operating expenses or hinder growth of our products and services. We may not be able to protect information in our products and services from use by others . LinkedIn and other Microsoft products and services contain valuable information and content protected by contractual restrictions or technical measures. In certain cases, we have made commitments to our members and users to limit access to or use of this information. Changes in the law or interpretations of the law may weaken our ability to prevent third parties from scraping or gathering information or content through use of bots or other measures and using it for their own benefit, thus diminishing the value of our products and services. Abuse of our platforms may harm our reputation or user engagement. Advertising, professional, and social platform abuses For platform products and services that provide content or host ads that come from or can be influenced by third parties, including GitHub, LinkedIn, Microsoft Advertising, MSN, and Xbox Live, our reputation or user engagement may be negatively affected by activity that is hostile or inappropriate. This activity may come from users impersonating other people or organizations, use of our products or services to spread terrorist or violent extremist content or to disseminate information that may be viewed as misleading or intended to manipulate the opinions of our users, or the use of our products or services that violates our terms of service or otherwise for objectionable or illegal ends. Preventing or responding to these actions may require us to make substantial investments in people and technology and these investments may not be successful, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements. 23 PART I Item 1A Digital safety and service misuse Our hosted consumer services as well as our enterprise services may be used by third parties to disseminate harmful or illegal content in violation of our terms or applicable law. We may not proactively discover such content due to scale and the limitations of existing technologies, and when discovered by users, such content may negatively affect our reputation, our brands, and user engagement. Regulations and other initiatives to make platforms responsible for preventing or eliminating harmful content online are gaining momentum and we expect this to continue. We may be subject to enhanced regulatory oversight, civil or criminal liability, or reputational damage if we fail to comply with content moderation regulations, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements. The development of the IoT presents security, privacy, and execution risks. To support the growth of the intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge, we are developing products, services, and technologies to power the IoT, a network of distributed and interconnected devices employing sensors, data, and computing capabilities including AI. The IoT’s great potential also carries substantial risks. IoT products and services may contain defects in design, manufacture, or operation, that make them insecure or ineffective for their intended purposes. An IoT solution has multiple layers of hardware, sensors, processors, software, and firmware, several of which we may not develop or control. Each layer, including the weakest layer, can impact the security of the whole system. Many IoT devices have limited interfaces and ability to be updated or patched. IoT solutions may collect large amounts of data, and our handling of IoT data may not satisfy customers or regulatory requirements. IoT scenarios may increasingly affect personal health and safety. If IoT solutions that include our technologies do not work as intended, violate the law, or harm individuals or businesses, we may be subject to legal claims or enforcement actions. These risks, if realized, may increase our costs, damage our reputation or brands, or negatively impact our revenues or margins. Issues in the use of AI in our offerings may result in reputational harm or liability . We are building AI into many of our offerings and we expect this element of our business to grow. We envision a future in which AI operating in our devices, applications, and the cloud helps our customers be more productive in their work and personal lives. As with many disruptive innovations, AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. AI algorithms may be flawed. Datasets may be insufficient or contain biased information. Inappropriate or controversial data practices by Microsoft or others could impair the acceptance of AI solutions. These deficiencies could undermine the decisions, predictions, or analysis AI applications produce, subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability, and brand or reputational harm. Some AI scenarios present ethical issues. If we enable or offer AI solutions that are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or other social issues, we may experience brand or reputational harm. We may have excessive outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure. Our increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power. We spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters. These demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth of existing services such as Bing, Azure, Microsoft Account services, Office 365, Microsoft Teams, Dynamics 365, OneDrive, SharePoint Online, Skype, Xbox Live, and Outlook.com. We are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users. Maintaining, securing, and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex, and requires development of principles for datacenter builds in geographies with higher safety risks. It requires that we maintain an Internet connectivity infrastructure and storage and compute capacity that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve. Inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data, insufficient Internet connectivity, or inadequate storage and compute capacity, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, regulatory actions, damage to our reputation, and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may adversely impact our consolidated financial statements. We may experience quality or supply problems. Our hardware products such as Xbox consoles, Surface devices, and other devices we design, manufacture, and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. We could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm as a result of recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims if we fail to prevent, detect, or address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs. 24 PART I Item 1A Our software products and services also may experience quality or reliability problems. The highly sophisticated software we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. Our customers increasingly rely on us for critical functions, potentially magnifying the impact of quality or reliability issues. Any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability. Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge. We acquire some device and datacenter components from sole suppliers. Our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us. If a component from a sole-source supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint, industry shortages, legal or regulatory changes, or other reasons, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity. Component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue. Xbox consoles, Surface devices, datacenter servers, and other hardware are assembled in Asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins. These same risks would apply to any other hardware and software products we may offer. We may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure. Source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. Although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to several licensees, we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code. If our source code leaks, we might lose future trade secret protection for that code. It may then become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. Unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described elsewhere in these risk factors. Legal changes, our evolving business model, piracy, and other factors may decrease the value of our intellectual property. Protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property on a global basis is difficult. While piracy adversely affects U.S. revenue, the impact on revenue from outside the U.S. is more significant, particularly countries in which the legal system provides less protection for intellectual property rights. Our revenue in these markets may grow more slowly than the underlying device market. Similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights. Throughout the world, we educate users about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks, and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. Reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue. We expend significant resources to patent the intellectual property we create with the expectation that we will generate revenues by incorporating that intellectual property in our products or services or, in some instances, by licensing our patents to others in return for a royalty. Changes in the law may continue to weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patents. These include legislative changes and regulatory actions that make it more difficult to obtain injunctions, and the increasing use of legal process to challenge issued patents. Similarly, licensees of our patents may fail to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties, or may contest the scope and extent of their obligations. The royalties we can obtain to monetize our intellectual property may decline because of the evolution of technology, selling price changes in products using licensed patents, or the difficulty of discovering infringements. Finally, our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations and may negatively impact revenue. 25 PART I Item 1A Third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. From time to time, others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. The number of these claims may grow because of constant technological change in the markets in which we compete, the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies, the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, and our offering of first-party devices, such as Surface. To resolve these claims, we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available, stop selling or redesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. These outcomes may cause operating margins to decline. Besides money damages, in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies. In some countries, such as Germany, an injunction can be issued before the parties have fully litigated the validity of the underlying patents. We have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk, and may continue to do so. We have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes. We are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. These claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives, including major new product releases such as Windows 10, significant business transactions, warranty or product claims, and employment practices. Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. The litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. A material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Government litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products. As a leading global software and device maker, government agencies closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign competition laws. Governments are actively enforcing competition laws and regulations, and this includes scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the European Union (“EU”), the U.S., and China. Some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. U.S. federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business. The European Commission (“the Commission”) closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume Microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. Flagship product releases such as Windows 10 can receive significant scrutiny under competition laws. For example, in 2004, the Commission ordered us to create new versions of our Windows operating system that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary Windows communications protocols in their own products. In 2009, the Commission accepted a set of commitments we offered to address the Commission’s concerns relating to competition in web browsing software, including an undertaking to address Commission concerns relating to interoperability. The web browsing commitments expired in 2014. The remaining obligations may limit our ability to innovate in Windows or other products in the future, diminish the developer appeal of the Windows platform, and increase our product development costs. The availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our products, which could hamper sales of our products. Our portfolio of first-party devices continues to grow; at the same time our OEM partners offer a large variety of devices for our platforms. As a result, increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our OEM partners, creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules. Regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase. Certain foreign governments, particularly in China and other countries in Asia, have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property. Government regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may result in fines, or hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses, reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that come from them. New competition law actions could be initiated, potentially using previous actions as precedent. The outcome of such actions, or steps taken to avoid them, could adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including: • We may have to choose between withdrawing products from certain geographies to avoid fines or designing and developing alternative versions of those products to comply with government rulings, which may entail a delay in a product release and removing functionality that customers want or on which developers rely. 26 PART I Item 1A • We may be required to make available licenses to our proprietary technologies on terms that do not reflect their fair market value or do not protect our associated intellectual property. • We are subject to a variety of ongoing commitments because of court or administrative orders, consent decrees, or other voluntary actions we have taken. If we fail to comply with these commitments, we may incur litigation costs and be subject to substantial fines or other remedial actions. • Our ability to realize anticipated Windows 10 post-sale monetization opportunities may be limited. Our global operations subject us to potential liability under anti-corruption, trade protection, and other laws and regulations. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other anti-corruption laws and regulations (“Anti-Corruption Laws”) prohibit corrupt payments by our employees, vendors, or agents, and the accounting provisions of the FCPA require us to maintain accurate books and records and adequate internal controls. From time to time, we receive inquiries from authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere which may be based on reports from employees and others about our business activities outside the U.S. and our compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws. Periodically, we receive such reports directly and investigate them. On July 22, 2019, our Hungarian subsidiary entered into a non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”) with the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and we agreed to the terms of a cease and desist order with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These agreements required us to pay $25.3 million in monetary penalties, disgorgement, and interest pertaining to activities at Microsoft’s subsidiary in Hungary. The NPA, which has a three-year term, also contains certain ongoing compliance requirements, including the obligations to disclose to the DOJ issues that may implicate the FCPA and to cooperate in any inquiries. Most countries in which we operate also have competition laws that prohibit competitors from colluding or otherwise attempting to reduce competition between themselves. While we devote substantial resources to our U.S. and international compliance programs and have implemented policies, training, and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments and collusive activity, our employees, vendors, or agents may violate our policies. Our failure to comply with Anti-Corruption Laws or competition laws could result in significant fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Operations outside the U.S. may be affected by changes in trade protection laws, policies, sanctions, and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment. We may be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we sell goods or services in violation of U.S. trade sanctions on restricted entities or countries such as Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria. Other regulatory areas that may apply to our products and online services offerings include user privacy, telecommunications, data storage and protection, and online content. For example, some regulators are taking the position that our offerings such as Microsoft Teams and Skype are covered by existing laws regulating telecommunications services, and some new laws, including EU Member State laws under the European Electronic Communications Code, are defining more of our services as regulated telecommunications services. This trend may continue and will result in these offerings being subjected to additional data protection, security, and law enforcement surveillance obligations. Data protection authorities may assert that our collection, use, and management of customer data is inconsistent with their laws and regulations. Legislative or regulatory action relating to cybersecurity requirements may increase the costs to develop, implement, or secure our products and services. Legislative or regulatory action could also emerge in the area of AI and content moderation, increasing costs or restricting opportunity. Applying these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Additionally, these laws and governments’ approach to their enforcement, and our products and services, are continuing to evolve. Compliance with these types of regulation may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we stop the alleged noncompliant activity. We strive to empower all people and organizations to achieve more, and accessibility of our products is an important aspect of this goal. There is increasing pressure from advocacy groups, regulators, competitors, customers, and other stakeholders to make technology more accessible. If our products do not meet customer expectations or emerging global accessibility requirements, we could lose sales opportunities or face regulatory actions 27 PART I Item 1A Laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased costs, legal claims, fines against us, or reputational damage . The growth of our Internet- and cloud-based services internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries. Legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, and transfer of personal data continue to evolve. For example, in July 2020 the Court of Justice of the EU invalidated a framework called Privacy Shield for companies to transfer data from EU member states to the United States. This ruling has led to uncertainty about the legal requirements for data transfers from the EU under other l egal mechanisms. Potential new rules and restrictions on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services in some markets. In May 2018, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), became effective. The law, which applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to products and services offered in the EU, imposes a range of compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data. Engineering efforts to build and maintain capabilities to facilitate compliance with the law have entailed substantial expense and the diversion of engineering resources from other projects and may continue to do so. We might experience reduced demand for our offerings if we are unable to engineer products that meet our legal duties or help our customers meet their obligations under the GDPR or other data regulations, or if our implementation to comply with the GDPR make s our offerings less attractive. The GDPR imposes significant new obligations and compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them. If we fail to comply with the GDPR, or if regulators assert we have failed to comply with the GDPR, it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions, which can result in monetary penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue, private lawsuits, reputational damage , and loss of customers . Countries around the world, and states in the U.S . such as California , ha ve adopted, or are considering adopting or expanding , laws and regulations imposing obligations regarding the handling of personal data. The Company’s investment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the value of the services we deliver to customers, to our operational efficiency and key opportunities in monetization, customer perceptions of quality, and operational efficiency. Our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory developments that impede realizing the expected return from this investment. Ongoing legal analyses, reviews, and inquiries by regulators of Microsoft practices, or relevant practices of other organizations, may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements, including data sovereignty and localization requirements, affecting the location, movement, collection, and use of our customer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding personal data may require changes in services, business practices, or internal systems that result in increased costs, lower revenue, reduced efficiency, or greater difficulty in competing with foreign-based firms. Compliance with data regulations might limit our ability to innovate or offer certain features and functionality in some jurisdictions where we operate. Failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity, as well as negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort. We may have additional tax liabilities. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, compliance with the 2017 United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the Company, the use of estimates in our consolidated financial statements, and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions. As regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the TCJA, and as we gather more information and perform more analysis, our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements. We regularly are under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. Although we believe that our provision for income taxes and our tax estimates are reasonable, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken. In addition, economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. We are currently under Internal Revenue Service audit for prior tax years, with the primary unresolved issues relating to transfer pricing. The final resolution of those audits, and other audits or litigation, may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made. 28 PART I Item 1A We earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S. A change in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our business or structure, or the expiration of or disputes about certain tax agreements in a particular country may result in higher effective tax rates for the Company. In addition, changes in U.S. federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries, including in the U.S., and changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions may materially adversely impact our consolidated financial statements. If our reputation or our brands are damaged, our business and operating results may be harmed . Our reputation and brands are globally recognized and are important to our business. Our reputation and brands affect our ability to attract and retain consumer, business, and public-sector customers. There are numerous ways our reputation or brands could be damaged. These include product safety or quality issues, or our environmental impact and sustainability, supply chain practices, or human rights record. We may experience backlash from customers, government entities, advocacy groups, employees, and other stakeholders that disagree with our product offering decisions or public policy positions. Damage to our reputation or our brands may occur from, among other things: • The introduction of new features, products, services, or terms of service that customers, users, or partners do not like. • Public scrutiny of our decisions regarding user privacy, data practices, or content. • Data security breaches, compliance failures, or actions of partners or individual employees. The proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood, speed, and magnitude of negative brand events. If our brands or reputation are damaged, it could negatively impact our revenues or margins, or ability to attract the most highly qualified employees. Our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks. Our customers are located throughout the world and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. The global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks. Our results of operations may be affected by global, regional, and local economic developments, monetary policy, inflation, and recession, as well as political and military disputes. In addition, our international growth strategy includes certain markets, the developing nature of which presents several risks, including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. Emerging nationalist trends in specific countries may significantly alter the trade environment. Changes to trade policy or agreements as a result of populism, protectionism, or economic nationalism may result in higher tariffs, local sourcing initiatives, or other developments that make it more difficult to sell our products in foreign countries. Disruptions of these kinds in developed or emerging markets could negatively impact demand for our products and services or increase operating costs. Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our results of operations . Our business with government customers may present additional uncertainties. We derive substantial revenue from government contracts. Government contracts generally can present risks and challenges not present in private commercial agreements. For instance, we may be subject to government audits and investigations relating to these contracts, we could be suspended or debarred as a governmental contractor, we could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, and under certain circumstances contracts may be rescinded. Some agreements may allow a government to terminate without cause and provide for higher liability limits for certain losses. Some contracts may be subject to periodic funding approval, reductions, or delays which could adversely impact public-sector demand for our products and services. These events could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition, and reputation . Adverse economic or market conditions may harm our business. Worsening economic conditions, including inflation, recession, pandemic, or other changes in economic conditions, may cause lower IT spending and adversely affect our revenue. If demand for PCs, servers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected. Our product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network. OEMs building devices that run our software have also been a significant means of distribution. The impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, OEM, or retailer, could cause sales channel disruption. 29 PART I Item 1A Challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. As a result, allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase. We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that affect global financial markets. A significant part of our investment portfolio comprises U.S. government securities. If global financial markets decline for long periods, or if there is a downgrade of the U.S. government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt, our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements. Catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business. A disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyberattack, terrorist attack, pandemic, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other critical functions. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other essential business operations are in the Seattle, Washington area, and we have other business operations in the Silicon Valley area of California, both of which are seismically active regions. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems, or the infrastructure or systems they rely on, such as power grids, could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations. Providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans, and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages in our consolidated financial statements. Abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries, which may increase our operating costs. These conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers, and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers. Geopolitical change may result in changing regulatory requirements that could impact our operating strategies, access to global markets, hiring, and profitability. Geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some markets or with some public-sector customers. Any of these changes may negatively impact our revenues. The occurrence of regional epidemics or a global pandemic may adversely affect our operations, financial condition, and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic is having widespread, rapidly evolving, and unpredictable impacts on global society, economies, financial markets, and business practices. Federal and state governments have implemented measures in an effort to contain the virus, including social distancing, travel restrictions, border closures, limitations on public gatherings, work from home, supply chain logistical changes, and closure of non-essential businesses. To protect the health and well-being of our employees, suppliers, and customers, we have made substantial modifications to employee travel policies, implemented office closures as employees are advised to work from home, and cancelled or shifted our conferences and other marketing events to virtual-only through fiscal year 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and may continue to impact our business operations, including our employees, customers, partners, and communities, and there is substantial uncertainty in the nature and degree of its continued effects over time. In the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2020, we have experienced adverse impacts to our supply chain, a slowdown in transactional licensing, and lower demand for our advertising services. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business going forward will depend on numerous evolving factors we cannot reliably predict, including the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business, and individuals' actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity including the possibility of recession or financial market instability. These factors may adversely impact consumer, business, and government spending on technology as well as customers' ability to pay for our products and services on an ongoing basis. This uncertainty also affects management’s accounting estimates and assumptions, which could result in greater variability in a variety of areas that depend on these estimates and assumptions, including investments, receivables, and forward-looking guidance. 30 PART I Item 1A Measures to contain the virus that impact us, our partners, distributors, and suppliers may further intensify these impacts and other risks described in these Risk Factors. Any of these may adversely impact our ability to: • Maintain our operations infrastructure, including the reliability and adequate capacity of cloud services. • Satisfy our contractual and regulatory compliance obligations as we adapt to changing usage patterns, such as through datacenter load balancing. • Ensure a high-quality and consistent supply chain and manufacturing operations for our hardware devices and datacenter operations. • Effectively manage our international operations through changes in trade practices and policies. • Hire and deploy people where we most need them. • Sustain the effectiveness and productivity of our operations including our sales, marketing, engineering, and distribution functions. We may incur increased costs to effectively manage these aspects of our business. If we are unsuccessful it may adversely impact our revenues, cash flows, market share growth, and reputation. The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the IT industry in particular are unclear. Environmental regulations or changes in the supply, demand or available sources of energy or other resources may affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our business. Changes in climate where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud-based services. Our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees. Our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. Maintaining our brand and reputation, as well as a diverse and inclusive work environment that enables all our employees to thrive, are important to our ability to recruit and retain employees. We are also limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. Changes to U.S. immigration policies that restrain the flow of technical and professional talent may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development efforts. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. How employment-related laws are interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs. 31 PART I Item 1B, 2, 3, 4 ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS We have received no written comments regarding our periodic or current reports from the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of our fiscal year 2020 that remain unresolved. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Our corporate headquarters are located in Redmond, Washington. We have approximately 15 million square feet of space located in King County, Washington that is used for engineering, sales, marketing, and operations, among other general and administrative purposes. These facilities include approximately 10 million square feet of owned space situated on approximately 520 acres of land we own at our corporate headquarters, and approximately five million square feet of space we lease. In addition, we own and lease space domestically that includes office, datacenter, and retail space. We also own and lease facilities internationally. The largest owned properties include: our research and development centers in China and India; our datacenters in Ireland, the Netherlands, and Singapore; and our operations and facilities in Ireland and the United Kingdom. The largest leased properties include space in the following locations: Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. In addition to the above locations, we have various product development facilities, both domestically and internationally, as described under Research and Development (Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K). The table below shows a summary of the square footage of our office, datacenter, retail, and other facilities owned and leased domestically and internationally as of June 30, 2020: (Square feet in millions) Location Owned Leased Total U.S. 20 14 34 International 7 16 23 Total 27 30 57 ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS While not material to the Company, the Company makes the following annual report of the general activities of the Company’s Antitrust Compliance Office as required by the Final Order and Judgment in Barovic v.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). OVERVIEW Microsoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. We strive to create local opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world. Our platforms and tools help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness, and public-sector efficiency. They also support new startups, improve educational and health outcomes, and empower human ingenuity. We generate revenue by offering a wide range of cloud-based and other services to people and businesses; licensing and supporting an array of software products; designing, manufacturing, and selling devices; and delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience. Our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees; designing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling our products and services; datacenter costs in support of our cloud-based services; and income taxes. As the world responds to the outbreak of a novel strain of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”), we are working to do our part by ensuring the safety of our employees, striving to protect the health and well-being of the communities in which we operate, and providing technology and resources to our customers to help them do their best work while remote. Highlights from fiscal year 2020 compared with fiscal year 2019 included: • Commercial cloud revenue increased 36% to $51.7 billion. • Office Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 12%, driven by Office 365 Commercial growth of 24%. • Office Consumer products and cloud services revenue increased 11%, with continued growth in Office 365 Consumer subscribers to 42.7 million. • LinkedIn revenue increased 20%. • Dynamics products and cloud services revenue increased 14%, driven by Dynamics 365 growth of 42%. • Server products and cloud services revenue increased 27%, driven by Azure growth of 56%. • Enterprise Services revenue increased 5%. • Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 18%. • Windows original equipment manufacturer licensing (“Windows OEM”) revenue increased 9%. • Surface revenue increased 8%. • Xbox content and services revenue increased 11%. • Search advertising revenue, excluding traffic acquisition costs, was relatively unchanged. Industry Trends Our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces. 35 PART II Item 7 Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks The markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud, and in some cases, the user’s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. The investments we are making in infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins. Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one’s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies did not significantly impact reported revenue or expenses from our international operations in the first and second quarters of fiscal year 2019, and reduced reported revenue and expenses from our international operations in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2019. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies reduced reported revenue and expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2020. Refer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) for a discussion of these factors and other risks. COVID-19 In fiscal year 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted our business operations, including our employees, customers, partners, and communities, and we saw the following trends in our financial operating results. In the Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud segments, cloud usage and demand increased as customers shifted to work and learn from home. We also experienced a slowdown in transactional licensing, particularly in small and medium businesses, and LinkedIn was negatively impacted by the weak job market and reductions in advertising spend. In the More Personal Computing segment, Windows OEM, Surface, and Gaming benefited from increased demand to support remote work-, play-, and learn-from-home scenarios, while Search was negatively impacted by reductions in advertising spend. The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to impact our business operations and financial operating results, and there is substantial uncertainty in the nature and degree of its continued effects over time. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business going forward will depend on numerous evolving factors we cannot reliably predict, including the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business, and individuals' actions in response to the pandemic; and the impact on economic activity including the possibility of recession or financial market instability. These factors may adversely impact consumer, business, and government spending on technology as well as customers' ability to pay for our products and services on an ongoing basis. This uncertainty also affects management’s accounting estimates and assumptions, which could result in greater variability in a variety of areas that depend on these estimates and assumptions, including investments, receivables, and forward-looking guidance. Refer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) for a discussion of these factors and other risks. Seasonality Our revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Second quarter revenue is driven by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period. 36 PART II Item 7 Reportable Segments We report our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing.

Net recognized gains on investments decreased due to lower gains and higher other-than-temporary impairments on equity investments, offset in part by gains on fixed income securities in the current period compared to losses in the prior period. Net gains on derivatives increased due to higher gains on foreign exchange and equity derivatives. 44 PART II Item 7 Fiscal Year 2019 Compared with Fiscal Year 2018 Interest and dividends income increased primarily due to higher yields on fixed-income securities. Interest expense decreased primarily driven by a decrease in outstanding long-term debt due to debt maturities, offset in part by higher finance lease expense . Net recognized gains on investments decreased primarily due to lower gains on sales of equity investments. Net gains on derivatives includes gains on foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives in the current period as compared to losses in the prior period . INCOME TAXES Effective Tax Rate Fiscal Year 2020 Compared with Fiscal Year 2019 Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2020 and 2019 was 17% and 10%, respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to a $2.6 billion net income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to intangible property transfers. Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland and Puerto Rico, and tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. The mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. In fiscal year 2020, our U.S. income before income taxes was $24.1 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $28.9 billion. In fiscal year 2019, our U.S. income before income taxes was $15.8 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $27.9 billion. Fiscal Year 2019 Compared with Fiscal Year 2018 Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2019 and 2018 was 10% and 55%, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the TCJA in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 and a $2.6 billion net income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to intangible property transfers. Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to the tax benefit related to intangible property transfers, and earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico. The mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. In fiscal year 2019, our U.S. income before income taxes was $15.8 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $27.9 billion. In fiscal year 2018, our U.S. income before income taxes was $11.5 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $24.9 billion. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was enacted into law, which significantly changed existing U.S. tax law and included numerous provisions that affect our business. We recorded a provisional net charge of $13.7 billion related to the enactment of the TCJA in fiscal year 2018, and adjusted the provisional net charge by recording additional tax expense of $157 million in fiscal year 2019 pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118. In fiscal year 2019, in response to the TCJA and recently issued regulations, we transferred certain intangible properties held by our foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. and Ireland. The transfers of intangible properties resulted in a $2.6 billion net income tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, as the value of future tax deductions exceeded the current tax liability from foreign jurisdictions and U.S. global intangible low-taxed income tax. Refer to Note 12 – Income Taxes of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. 45 PART II Item 7 Uncertain Tax Positions We settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011. In February 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. We also settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in fiscal year 2016, and a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. We remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2013. In April 2020, the IRS commenced the audit for tax years 2014 to 2017. As of June 30, 2020, the primary unresolved issues for the IRS audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have a material impact in our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved. We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2019, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures which exclude the net tax impact of transfer of intangible properties in fiscal year 2019 and the net tax impact of the TCJA in fiscal years 2019 and 2018. We believe these non-GAAP measures aid investors by providing additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify trends affecting our business. For comparability of reporting, management considers non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP financial results in evaluating business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures presented should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table reconciles our financial results reported in accordance with GAAP to non-GAAP financial results: (In millions, except percentages and per share amounts) 2020 2019 2018 Percentage Change 2020 Versus 2019 Percentage Change 2019 Versus 2018 Net income $ 44,281 $ 39,240 $ 16,571 13% 137% Net tax impact of transfer of intangible properties 0 (2,567 ) 0 * * Net tax impact of the TCJA 0 157 13,696 * * Non-GAAP net income $ 44,281 $ 36,830 $ 30,267 20% 22% Diluted earnings per share $ 5.76 $ 5.06 $ 2.13 14% 138% Net tax impact of transfer of intangible properties 0 (0.33 ) 0 * * Net tax impact of the TCJA 0 0.02 1.75 * * Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share $ 5.76 $ 4.75 $ 3.88 21% 22% * Not meaningful. 46 PART II Item 7 FINANCIAL CONDITION Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $136.5 billion and $133.8 billion as of June 30, 2020 and 2019. Equity investments were $3.0 billion and $2.6 billion as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities. Valuation In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Level 3 investments are valued using internally-developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio. A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate. Cash Flows Fiscal Year 2020 Compared with Fiscal Year 2019 Cash from operations increased $8.5 billion to $60.7 billion for fiscal year 2020, mainly due to an increase in cash from customers, offset in part by an increase in cash used to pay income taxes, suppliers, and employees. Cash used in financing increased $9.1 billion to $46.0 billion for fiscal year 2020, mainly due to a $3.4 billion cash premium on our debt exchange, a $3.4 billion increase in common stock repurchases, a $1.5 billion increase in repayments of debt, and a $1.3 billion increase in dividends paid. Cash used in investing decreased $3.6 billion to $12.2 billion for fiscal year 2020, mainly due to a $6.4 billion increase in cash from net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, offset in part by a $1.5 billion increase in additions to property and equipment and $1.2 billion in other investing to facilitate the purchase of components. 47 PART II Item 7 Fiscal Year 2019 Compared with Fiscal Year 2018 Cash from operations increased $8.3 billion to $52.2 billion for fiscal year 2019, mainly due to an increase in cash received from customers, offset in part by an increase in cash paid to suppliers and employees and an increase in cash paid for income taxes. Cash used in financing increased $3.3 billion to $36.9 billion for fiscal year 2019, mainly due to an $8.8 billion increase in common stock repurchases and a $1.1 billion increase in dividends paid, offset in part by a $6.2 billion decrease in repayments of debt, net of proceeds from issuance of debt. Cash used in investing increased $9.7 billion to $15.8 billion for fiscal year 2019, mainly due to a $6.0 billion decrease in cash from net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, a $2.3 billion increase in additions to property and equipment, and a $1.5 billion increase in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets. Debt We issue debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment. The proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt. In June 2020, we exchanged a portion of our existing debt at premium for cash and new debt with longer maturities to take advantage of favorable financing rates in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment. Refer to Note 11 – Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. Unearned Revenue Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include Software Assurance (“SA”) and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service. Refer to Note 1 – Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. The following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of June 30, 2020: (In millions) Three Months Ending September 30, 2020 $ 13,884 December 31, 2020 10,950 March 31, 2021 7,476 June 30, 2021 3,690 Thereafter 3,180 Total $ 39,180 If our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction-based products and services, the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption, as applicable. Share Repurchases For fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, we repurchased 126 million shares, 150 million shares, and 99 million shares of our common stock for $19.7 billion, $16.8 billion, and $8.6 billion, respectively, through our share repurchase programs. All repurchases were made using cash resources. Refer to Note 16 – Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. Dividends Refer to Note 16 – Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. 48 PART II Item 7 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. Additionally, we have agreed to cover damages resulting from breaches of certain security and privacy commitments in our cloud business. In evaluating estimated losses on these obligations, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. These obligations did not have a material impact in our consolidated financial statements during the periods presented. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the payments due by fiscal year for our outstanding contractual obligations as of June 30, 2020: (In millions) 2021 2022-2023 2024-2025 Thereafter Total Long-term debt: (a) Principal payments $ 3,750 $ 10,716 $ 7,500 $ 45,441 $ 67,407 Interest payments 2,028 3,736 3,293 25,265 34,322 Construction commitments (b) 4,761 280 0 0 5,041 Operating leases, including imputed interest (c) 2,420 3,986 2,929 4,409 13,744 Finance leases, including imputed interest (c) 992 2,243 2,676 9,611 15,522 Transition tax (d) 1,450 2,899 6,343 4,531 15,223 Purchase commitments (e) 25,059 1,324 369 272 27,024 Other long-term liabilities (f) 0 294 32 356 682 Total $ 40,460 $ 25,478 $ 23,142 $ 89,885 $ 178,965 (a) Refer to Note 11 – Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). (b) Refer to Note 7 – Property and Equipment of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). (c) Refer to Note 14 – Leases of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). (d) Refer to Note 12 – Income Taxes of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). (e) Amounts represent purchase commitments, including open purchase orders and take-or-pay contracts that are not presented as construction commitments above. (f) We have excluded long-term tax contingencies, other tax liabilities, and deferred income taxes of $15.2 billion from the amounts presented as the timing of these obligations is uncertain. We have also excluded unearned revenue and non-cash items. Other Planned Uses of Capital We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology, as well as continue making acquisitions that align with our business strategy. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, datacenters, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years to support growth in our cloud offerings. We have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, retail stores, and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources. Liquidity As a result of the TCJA, we are required to pay a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to U.S. income tax. Under the TCJA, the transition tax is payable in interest-free installments over eight years, with 8% due in each of the first five years, 15% in year six, 20% in year seven, and 25% in year eight. We have paid transition tax of $3.2 billion, which included $1.2 billion for fiscal year 2020. The remaining transition tax of $15.2 billion is payable over the next six years with a final payment in fiscal year 2026. During fiscal year 2020, we also paid $3.7 billion related to the transfer of intangible properties that occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019. 49 PART II Item 7 We expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital markets to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as dividends, share repurchases, debt maturities, material capital expenditures, and the transition tax related to the TCJA, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE Refer to Note 1 – Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies, as well as uncertainty in the current economic environment due to the recent outbreak of COVID-19. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, and inventories. Revenue Recognition Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided. Judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price (“SSP"") for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP. Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers. Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented. 50 PART II Item 7 Impairment of Investment Securities We review debt investments quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost. We also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment indicates that the investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. We perform a qualitative assessment on a quarterly basis. We are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine the amount of the impairment loss. Once an investment is determined to be impaired, an impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net. Goodwill We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. Research and Development Costs Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to production. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products. 51 PART II Item 7 Legal and Other Contingencies The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. Income Taxes The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. The TCJA significantly changes existing U.S. tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business. Refer to Note 12 – Income Taxes of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. Inventories Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. These reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE In July 2020, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment and determined we should increase the estimated useful life of server equipment from three years to four years and increase the estimated useful life of network equipment from two years to four years. This change in accounting estimate will be effective beginning fiscal year 2021. Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment included in “Property and equipment, net” as of June 30, 2020, it is estimated this change will increase our fiscal year 2021 operating income by $2.7 billion. 52 PART II Item 7 STATEMENT OF MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report. The consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management’s estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing consolidated financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. These systems are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits. The Company engaged Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit and render an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). The Board of Directors, through its Audit Committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the Company, meets periodically with management, internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting. Deloitte & Touche LLP and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the Audit Committee. Satya Nadella Chief Executive Officer Amy E.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK RISKS We are exposed to economic risk from foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, and equity prices. We use derivatives instruments to manage these risks, however, they may still impact our consolidated financial statements. Foreign Currencies Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions, including hedges. Principal currency exposures include the Euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar. Interest Rate Securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We manage the average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global fixed-income indices. Credit Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Equity Securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to price risk.

We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. The recast of these prior period amounts had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income statements, or net cash from or used in operating, financing, or investing on our consolidated cash flows statements. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Estimates and Assumptions Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the standalone selling price (“SSP”) of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand for, our inventory; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties, including uncertainty in the current economic environment due to the recent outbreak of a novel strain of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”). In July 2020, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment and determined we should increase the estimated useful life of server equipment from three years to four years and increase the estimated useful life of network equipment from two years to four years . This change in accounting estimate will be effective beginning fiscal year 2021. Foreign Currencies Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income. Revenue Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue Product revenue includes sales from operating systems; cross-device productivity applications; server applications; business solution applications; desktop and server management tools; software development tools; video games; and hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories. Service and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content such as Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and Xbox Live; solution support; and consulting services. Service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising and LinkedIn. 60 PART II Item 8 Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. Nature of Products and Services Licenses for on-premises software provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available to the customer. Customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide customers with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Revenue from distinct on-premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. In cases where we allocate revenue to software updates, primarily because the updates are provided at no additional charge, revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the estimated life of the related device or license. Certain volume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements, include on-premises licenses combined with Software Assurance (“SA”). SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and provides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use products more efficiently. On-premises licenses are considered distinct performance obligations when sold with SA. Revenue allocated to SA is generally recognized ratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits, given that SA comprises distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time. Cloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software, are provided on either a subscription or consumption basis. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is recognized based on the customer utilization of such resources. When cloud services require a significant level of integration and interdependency with software and the individual components are not considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud services are provided. Revenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. Revenue from consulting services is recognized as services are provided. Our hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot function without the operating system. In these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to resellers or directly to end customers through retail stores and online marketplaces. Refer to Note 19 – Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information, including revenue by significant product and service offering. Significant Judgments Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided. 61 PART II Item 8 Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP. Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers. Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented. Contract Balances Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. We record a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. For multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. We record a receivable related to revenue recognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we have an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those licenses. As of June 30, 2020 and 2019, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $ 2.7 billion and $ 2.2 billion, respectively, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2020 2019 2018 Balance, beginning of period $ 434 $ 397 $ 361 Charged to costs and other 560 153 134 Write-offs ( 178 ) ( 116 ) ( 98 ) Balance, end of period $ 816 $ 434 $ 397 Allowance for doubtful accounts included in our consolidated balance sheets: (In millions) June 30, 2020 2019 2018 Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts $ 788 $ 411 $ 377 Other long-term assets 28 23 20 Total $ 816 $ 434 $ 397 62 PART II Item 8 Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include SA and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the future; LinkedIn subscriptions; Office 365 subscriptions; Xbox Live subscriptions; Windows 10 post-delivery support; Dynamics business solutions; Skype prepaid credits and subscriptions; and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service. Refer to Note 13 – Unearned Revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes in unearned revenue during the period. Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers with financing. Examples include invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year on-premises licenses that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront. We record financing receivables when we offer certain of our customers the option to acquire our software products and services offerings through a financing program in a limited number of countries. As of June 30, 2020 and 2019, our financing receivables, net were $ 5.2 billion and $ 4.3 billion, respectively, for short-term and long-term financing receivables, which are included in other current assets and other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. We record an allowance to cover expected losses based on troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer We recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be capitalized. Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were immaterial during the periods presented and are included in other current and long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. We apply a practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs include our internal sales force compensation program and certain partner sales incentive programs as we have determined annual compensation is commensurate with annual sales activities. Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on PCs sold by original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”), to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online advertising space; costs incurred to support and maintain online products and services, including datacenter costs and royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and the amortization of capitalized software development costs. Capitalized software development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the products. Product Warranty We provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary. 63 PART II Item 8 Research and Development Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to production. Once technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $ 1.6 billion in fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018. Stock-Based Compensation Compensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance stock units (“PSUs”), is measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the related service or performance period. The fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. We measure the fair value of PSUs using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Compensation cost for RSUs is recognized using the straight-line method and for PSUs is recognized using the accelerated method. Compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase. Income Taxes Income tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. Certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. All deferred income taxes are classified as long-term in our consolidated balance sheets. Financial Instruments Investments We consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. 64 PART II Item 8 Debt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in fair value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are recorded in other comprehensive income . Debt investments are impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. We employ a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost. We also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of , and business outlook , for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments (referred to as the measurement alternative). We perform a qualitative assessment on a quarterly basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. Changes in value are recorded in other income (expense), net. Derivatives Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), net with offsetting gains and losses on the hedged items. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in earnings with the corresponding hedged item. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net. Fair Value Measurements We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are: • Level 1 – inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Our Level 1 investments include U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges. • Level 2 – inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies. Our Level 2 investments include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities primarily include certain over-the-counter option and swap contracts. 65 PART II Item 8 • Level 3 – inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level 3 assets and liabilities include investments in corporate notes and bonds , municipal securities , and goodwill and intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge. Unobservable inputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities. We measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis. The fair values of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. Our other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. Inventories Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use, three to seven years ; computer equipment, two to three years ; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years ; leasehold improvements, three to 20 years ; and furniture and equipment, one to 10 years . Land is not depreciated. Leases We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. For certain equipment leases, such as vehicles, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. Additionally, for certain equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU assets and liabilities. Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. 66 PART II Item 8 Intangible Assets Our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from one to 20 years . We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired. Recent Accounting Guidance Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance Financial Instruments – Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities In August 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued new guidance related to accounting for hedging activities. This guidance expands strategies that qualify for hedge accounting, changes how many hedging relationships are presented in the financial statements, and simplifies the application of hedge accounting in certain situations. We adopted the standard effective July 1, 2019. As we did not hold derivative instruments requiring an adjustment upon adoption, there was no impact in our consolidated financial statements. Adoption of the standard enhanced the presentation of the effects of our hedging instruments and the hedged items in our consolidated financial statements to increase the understandability of the results of our hedging strategies. Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted Financial Instruments – Credit Losses In June 2016, the FASB issued a new standard to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology under current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. We will be required to use a forward-looking expected credit loss model for accounts receivable, loans, and other financial instruments. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities will also be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of the securities. The standard will be adopted upon the effective date for us beginning July 1, 2020. Adoption of the standard will be applied using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date to align our credit loss methodology with the new standard. We have evaluated the impact of this standard in our consolidated financial statements, including accounting policies, processes, and systems. We continue to monitor economic implications of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on current market conditions, adoption of the standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Accounting for Income Taxes In December 2019, the FASB issued a new standard to simplify the accounting for income taxes. The guidance eliminates certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period, and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences related to changes in ownership of equity method investments and foreign subsidiaries. The guidance also simplifies aspects of accounting for franchise taxes and enacted changes in tax laws or rates, and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. The standard will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2021, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard in our consolidated financial statements, including accounting policies, processes, and systems. NOTE 2 — EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards. 67 PART II Item 8 The components of basic and diluted EPS were as follows: (In millions, except earnings per share) Year Ended June 30, 2020 2019 2018 Net income available for common shareholders (A) $ 44,281 $ 39,240 $ 16,571 Weighted average outstanding shares of common stock (B) 7,610 7,673 7,700 Dilutive effect of stock-based awards 73 80 94 Common stock and common stock equivalents (C) 7,683 7,753 7,794 Earnings Per Share Basic (A/B) $ 5.82 $ 5.11 $ 2.15 Diluted (A/C) $ 5.76 $ 5.06 $ 2.13 Anti-dilutive stock-based awards excluded from the calculations of diluted EPS were immaterial during the periods presented.

Equity investments presented as “Other” in the tables above include investments without readily determinable fair values measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments, and investments measured at fair value using net asset value as a practical expedient which are not categorized in the fair value hierarchy. As of June 30, 2020 and 2019, equity investments without readily determinable fair values measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments were $ 1.4 billion and $ 1.2 billion, respectively. Unrealized Losses on Debt Investments Debt investments with continuous unrealized losses for less than 12 months and 12 months or greater and their related fair values were as follows: Less than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater Total Unrealized Losses (In millions) Fair Value Unrealized Losses Fair Value Unrealized Losses Total Fair Value June 30, 2020 U.S. government and agency securities $ 2,323 $ ( 1 ) $ 0 $ 0 $ 2,323 $ ( 1 ) Foreign government bonds 500 ( 3 ) 0 0 500 ( 3 ) Mortgage- and asset-backed securities 1,014 ( 6 ) 0 0 1,014 ( 6 ) Corporate notes and bonds 649 ( 17 ) 0 0 649 ( 17 ) Municipal securities 66 ( 4 ) 0 0 66 ( 4 ) Total $ 4,552 $ ( 31 ) $ 0 $ 0 $ 4,552 $ ( 31 ) 70 PART II Item 8 Less than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater Total Unrealized Losses (In millions) Fair Value Unrealized Losses Fair Value Unrealized Losses Total Fair Value June 30, 2019 U.S. government and agency securities $ 1,491 $ ( 1 ) $ 39,158 $ ( 103 ) $ 40,649 $ ( 104 ) Foreign government bonds 25 0 77 ( 8 ) 102 ( 8 ) Mortgage- and asset-backed securities 664 ( 1 ) 378 ( 2 ) 1,042 ( 3 ) Corporate notes and bonds 498 ( 3 ) 376 ( 4 ) 874 ( 7 ) Total $ 2,678 $ ( 5 ) $ 39,989 $ ( 117 ) $ 42,667 $ ( 122 ) Unrealized losses from fixed-income securities are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates.

Our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. Our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Foreign Currencies Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. Foreign currency risks related to certain non-U.S. dollar-denominated investments are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair value hedging instruments. Foreign currency risks related to certain Euro-denominated debt are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. In the past, option and forward contracts were used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue and were designated as cash flow hedging instruments. Principal currencies hedged included the Euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar. Certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign exchange rates on certain balance sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures. 71 PART II Item 8 Interest Rate Interest rate risks related to certain fixed-rate debt are hedged using interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedging instruments to effectively convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates. Securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We manage the average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using exchange-traded option and futures contracts and over-the-counter swap and option contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in “Other contracts” in the tables below. Equity Securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to market price risk. At times, we may hold options, futures, and swap contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in “Other contracts” in the tables below. Credit Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We use credit default swap contracts to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in “Other contracts” in the tables below. Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features Certain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum liquidity of $ 1.0 billion. To the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to the standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. As of June 30, 2020, our long-term unsecured debt rating was AAA , and cash investments were in excess of $ 1.0 billion. As a result, no collateral was required to be posted. The following table presents the notional amounts of our outstanding derivative instruments measured in U.S. dollar equivalents: (In millions) June 30, 2020 June 30, 2019 Designated as Hedging Instruments Foreign exchange contracts purchased $ 635 $ 0 Foreign exchange contracts sold 6,754 6,034 Interest rate contracts purchased 1,295 0 Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Foreign exchange contracts purchased 11,896 14,889 Foreign exchange contracts sold 15,595 15,614 Other contracts purchased 1,844 2,007 Other contracts sold 757 456 72 PART II Item 8 Fair Values of Derivative Instruments The following table presents our derivative instruments: Derivative Derivative Derivative Derivative (In millions) Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities June 30, 2020 June 30, 2019 Designated as Hedging Instruments Foreign exchange contracts $ 44 $ ( 54 ) $ 0 $ ( 93 ) Interest rate contracts 93 0 0 0 Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Foreign exchange contracts 245 ( 334 ) 204 ( 172 ) Other contracts 18 ( 11 ) 46 ( 7 ) Gross amounts of derivatives 400 ( 399 ) 250 ( 272 ) Gross amounts of derivatives offset in the balance sheet ( 154 ) 158 ( 113 ) 114 Cash collateral received 0 ( 154 ) 0 ( 78 ) Net amounts of derivatives $ 246 $ ( 395 ) $ 137 $ ( 236 ) Reported as Short-term investments $ 35 $ 0 $ ( 13 ) $ 0 Other current assets 199 0 146 0 Other long-term assets 12 0 4 0 Other current liabilities 0 ( 334 ) 0 ( 221 ) Other long-term liabilities 0 ( 61 ) 0 ( 15 ) Total $ 246 $ ( 395 ) $ 137 $ ( 236 ) Gross derivative assets and liabilities subject to legally enforceable master netting agreements for which we have elected to offset were $ 399 million and $ 399 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2020, and $ 247 million and $ 272 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2019.

We have committed $ 5.0 billion for the construction of new buildings, building improvements, and leasehold improvements as of June 30, 2020. During fiscal year 2020, we recorded an impairment charge of $ 186 million to Property and Equipment, primarily to leasehold improvements, due to the closing of our Microsoft Store physical locations. NOTE 8 — BUSINESS COMBINATIONS GitHub, Inc. On October 25, 2018 , we acquired GitHub, Inc. (“GitHub”), a software development platform, in a $ 7.5 billion stock transaction (inclusive of total cash payments of $ 1.3 billion in respect of vested GitHub equity awards and an indemnity escrow). The acquisition is expected to empower developers to achieve more at every stage of the development lifecycle, accelerate enterprise use of GitHub, and bring Microsoft’s developer tools and services to new audiences. The financial results of GitHub have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition. GitHub is reported as part of our Intelligent Cloud segment. The allocation of the purchase price to goodwill was completed as of June 30, 2019. The major classes of assets and liabilities to which we allocated the purchase price were as follows: (In millions) Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments $ 234 Goodwill 5,497 Intangible assets 1,267 Other assets 143 Other liabilities ( 217 ) Total $ 6,924 The goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition is primarily attributable to anticipated synergies from future growth and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. We assigned the goodwill to our Intelligent Cloud segment. 75 PART II Item 8 Following are the details of the purchase price allocated to the intangible assets acquired: (In millions) Amount Weighted Average Life Customer-related $ 648 8 years Technology-based 447 5 years Marketing-related 170 10 years Contract-based 2 2 years Total $ 1,267 7 years Transactions recognized separately from the purchase price allocation were approximately $ 600 million, primarily related to equity awards recognized as expense over the related service period. Other During fiscal year 2020, we completed 15 acquisitions for $ 2.4 billion, substantially all of which were paid in cash. These entities have been included in our consolidated results of operations since their respective acquisition dates. The effects of these business combinations, individually and in aggregate, were not material to our consolidated results of operations. NOTE 9 — GOODWILL Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill were as follows: (In millions) June 30, 2018 Acquisitions Other June 30, 2019 Acquisitions Other June 30, 2020 Productivity and Business Processes $ 23,823 $ 514 $ ( 60 ) $ 24,277 $ 7 $ ( 94 ) $ 24,190 Intelligent Cloud 5,703 5,605 (a) 43 (a) 11,351 1,351 ( 5 ) 12,697 More Personal Computing 6,157 289 ( 48 ) 6,398 96 ( 30 ) 6,464 Total $ 35,683 $ 6,408 $ ( 65 ) $ 42,026 $ 1,454 $ ( 129 ) $ 43,351 (a) Includes goodwill of $ 5.5 billion related to GitHub. See Note 8 – Business Combinations for further information . The measurement periods for the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed end as soon as information on the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition dates becomes available, but do not exceed 12 months. Adjustments in purchase price allocations may require a change in the amounts allocated to goodwill during the periods in which the adjustments are determined. Any change in the goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency translations and purchase accounting adjustments are presented as “Other” in the table above. Also included in “Other” are business dispositions and transfers between segments due to reorganizations, as applicable. Goodwill Impairment We test goodwill for impairment annually on May 1 at the reporting unit level, primarily using a discounted cash flow methodology with a peer-based, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. We believe use of a discounted cash flow approach is the most reliable indicator of the fair values of the businesses. No instances of impairment were identified in our May 1, 2020, May 1, 2019, or May 1, 2018 tests. As of June 30, 2020 and 2019, accumulated goodwill impairment was $ 11.3 billion. 76 PART II Item 8 NOTE 10 — INTANGIBLE ASSETS The components of intangible assets, all of which are finite-lived, were as follows: (In millions) Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Amount Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Amount June 30, 2020 2019 Technology-based $ 8,160 $ ( 6,381 ) $ 1,779 $ 7,691 $ ( 5,771 ) $ 1,920 Customer-related 4,967 ( 2,320 ) 2,647 4,709 ( 1,785 ) 2,924 Marketing-related 4,158 ( 1,588 ) 2,570 4,165 ( 1,327 ) 2,838 Contract-based 474 ( 432 ) 42 574 ( 506 ) 68 Total $ 17,759 $ ( 10,721 ) $ 7,038 $ 17,139 (a) $ ( 9,389 ) $ 7,750 (a) Includes intangible assets of $ 1.3 billion related to GitHub.

The premium will be amortized over the term of the new debt. (b) Refer to Note 5 – Derivatives for further information on the interest rate swaps related to fixed-rate debt. As of June 30, 2020 and 2019, the estimated fair value of long-term debt, including the current portion, was $ 77.1 billion and $ 78.9 billion, respectively. The estimated fair values are based on Level 2 inputs. Debt in the table above is comprised of senior unsecured obligations and ranks equally with our other outstanding obligations. Interest is paid semi-annually, except for the Euro-denominated debt, which is paid annually. The following table outlines maturities of our long-term debt, including the current portion, as of June 30, 2020: (In millions) Year Ending June 30, 2021 $ 3,750 2022 7,966 2023 2,750 2024 5,250 2025 2,250 Thereafter 45,441 Total $ 67,407 78 PART II Item 8 NOTE 12 — INCOME TAXES Tax Cuts and Jobs Act On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) was enacted into law, which significantly changed existing U.S. tax law and included numerous provisions that affect our business. We recorded a provisional net charge of $ 13.7 billion related to the enactment of the TCJA in fiscal year 2018, and adjusted the provisional net charge by recording additional tax expense of $ 157 million in fiscal year 2019 pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118. In fiscal year 2019, in response to the TCJA and recently issued regulations, we transferred certain intangible properties held by our foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. and Ireland. The transfers of intangible properties resulted in a $ 2.6 billion net income tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, as the value of future tax deductions exceeded the current tax liability from foreign jurisdictions and U.S. global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) tax. Provision for Income Taxes The components of the provision for income taxes were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2020 2019 2018 Current Taxes U.S. federal $ 3,537 $ 4,718 $ 19,764 U.S. state and local 763 662 934 Foreign 4,444 5,531 4,348 Current taxes $ 8,744 $ 10,911 $ 25,046 Deferred Taxes U.S. federal $ 58 $ ( 5,647 ) $ ( 4,292 ) U.S. state and local ( 6 ) ( 1,010 ) ( 458 ) Foreign ( 41 ) 194 ( 393 ) Deferred taxes $ 11 $ ( 6,463 ) $ ( 5,143 ) Provision for income taxes $ 8,755 $ 4,448 $ 19,903 U.S. and foreign components of income before income taxes were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2020 2019 2018 U.S. $ 24,116 $ 15,799 $ 11,527 Foreign 28,920 27,889 24,947 Income before income taxes $ 53,036 $ 43,688 $ 36,474 79 PART II Item 8 Effective Tax Rate The items accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the U.S. federal statutory rate and our effective rate were as follows: Year Ended June 30, 2020 2019 2018 Federal statutory rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 28.1 % Effect of: Foreign earnings taxed at lower rates ( 3.7 )% ( 4.1 )% ( 7.8 )% Impact of the enactment of the TCJA 0 % 0.4 % 37.7 % Impact of intangible property transfers 0 % ( 5.9 )% 0 % Foreign-derived intangible income deduction ( 1.1 )% ( 1.4 )% 0 % State income taxes, net of federal benefit 1.3 % 0.7 % 1.3 % Research and development credit ( 1.1 )% ( 1.1 )% ( 1.3 )% Excess tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation ( 2.2 )% ( 2.2 )% ( 2.5 )% Interest, net 1.0 % 1.0 % 1.2 % Other reconciling items, net 1.3 % 1.8 % ( 2.1 )% Effective rate 16.5 % 10.2 % 54.6 % The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2020 is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland and Puerto Rico, and tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2019 is primarily due to a $ 2.6 billion net income tax benefit related to intangible property transfers, and earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico. The increase from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2018 is primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the TCJA in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, offset in part by earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions. In fiscal year 2020, our foreign regional operating centers in Ireland and Puerto Rico, which are taxed at rates lower than the U.S. rate, generated 86 % of our foreign income before tax. In fiscal years 2019 and 2018, our foreign regional operating centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico, which are taxed at rates lower than the U.S. rate, generated 82 % and 87 % of our foreign income before tax, respectively. Other reconciling items, net consists primarily of tax credits and GILTI tax. In fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, there were no individually significant other reconciling items. The increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 was primarily due to a $ 2.6 billion net income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to intangible property transfers. The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the TCJA in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, and a $2.6 billion net income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to intangible property transfers. 80 PART II Item 8 The components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows: (In millions) June 30, 2020 2019 Deferred Income Tax Assets Stock-based compensation expense $ 461 $ 406 Accruals, reserves, and other expenses 2,721 2,287 Loss and credit carryforwards 865 3,518 Depreciation and amortization 6,361 7,046 Leasing liabilities 3,025 1,594 Unearned revenue 1,553 475 Other 354 367 Deferred income tax assets 15,340 15,693 Less valuation allowance ( 755 ) ( 3,214 ) Deferred income tax assets, net of valuation allowance $ 14,585 $ 12,479 Deferred Income Tax Liabilities Book/tax basis differences in investments and debt $ ( 2,642 ) $ ( 738 ) Unearned revenue 0 ( 30 ) Leasing assets ( 2,817 ) ( 1,510 ) Deferred GILTI tax liabilities ( 2,581 ) ( 2,607 ) Other ( 344 ) ( 291 ) Deferred income tax liabilities $ ( 8,384 ) $ ( 5,176 ) Net deferred income tax assets $ 6,201 $ 7,303 Reported As Other long-term assets $ 6,405 $ 7,536 Long-term deferred income tax liabilities ( 204 ) ( 233 ) Net deferred income tax assets $ 6,201 $ 7,303 Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are paid or recovered. As of June 30, 2020, we had federal, state, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 547 million, $ 975 million, and $ 2.0 billion, respectively. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in various years from fiscal 2021 through 2040 , if not utilized. The majority of our foreign net operating loss carryforwards do not expire. Certain acquired net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation, but are expected to be realized with the exception of those which have a valuation allowance. The valuation allowance disclosed in the table above relates to the foreign net operating loss carryforwards and other net deferred tax assets that may not be realized. In fiscal year 2020, we removed $ 2.0 billion of foreign net operating losses and corresponding valuation allowances as a result of the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary. There was no impact to our consolidated financial statements. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, were $ 12.5 billion, $ 8.4 billion, and $ 5.5 billion in fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Uncertain Tax Positions Gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions as of June 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018, were $ 13.8 billion, $ 13.1 billion, and $ 12.0 billion, respectively, which were primarily included in long-term income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets. If recognized, the resulting tax benefit would affect our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018 by $ 12.1 billion, $ 12.0 billion, and $ 11.3 billion, respectively. 81 PART II Item 8 As of June 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we had accrued interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $ 4.0 billion, $ 3.4 billion, and $ 3.0 billion, respectively, net of income tax benefits. The provision for income taxes for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018 included interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $ 579 million, $ 515 million, and $ 688 million, respectively, net of income tax benefits. The aggregate changes in the gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2020 2019 2018 Beginning unrecognized tax benefits $ 13,146 $ 11,961 $ 11,737 Decreases related to settlements ( 31 ) ( 316 ) ( 193 ) Increases for tax positions related to the current year 647 2,106 1,445 Increases for tax positions related to prior years 366 508 151 Decreases for tax positions related to prior years ( 331 ) ( 1,113 ) ( 1,176 ) Decreases due to lapsed statutes of limitations ( 5 ) 0 ( 3 ) Ending unrecognized tax benefits $ 13,792 $ 13,146 $ 11,961 We settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011. In February 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. We also settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in fiscal year 2016, and a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. We remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2013 . In April 2020, the IRS commenced the audit for tax years 2014 to 2017 . As of June 30, 2020, the primary unresolved issues for the IRS audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have a material impact in our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved. We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2019 , some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. NOTE 13 — UNEARNED REVENUE Unearned revenue by segment was as follows: (In millions) June 30, 2020 2019 Productivity and Business Processes $ 18,643 $ 16,831 Intelligent Cloud 16,620 16,988 More Personal Computing 3,917 3,387 Total $ 39,180 $ 37,206 Changes in unearned revenue were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2020 Balance, beginning of period $ 37,206 Deferral of revenue 78,922 Recognition of unearned revenue ( 76,948 ) Balance, end of period $ 39,180 82 PART II Item 8 Revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations, which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods, was $ 111 billion as of June 30, 2020, of which $ 107 billion is related to the commercial portion of revenue. We expect to recognize approximately 50 % of this revenue over the next 12 months and the remainder thereafter. NOTE 14 — LEASES We have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, retail stores, and certain equipment. Our leases have remaining lease terms of 1 year to 20 years, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to 5 years , and some of which include options to terminate the leases within 1 year. The components of lease expense were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2020 2019 2018 Operating lease cost $ 2,043 $ 1,707 $ 1,585 Finance lease cost: Amortization of right-of-use assets $ 611 $ 370 $ 243 Interest on lease liabilities 336 247 175 Total finance lease cost $ 947 $ 617 $ 418 Supplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2020 2019 2018 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities: Operating cash flows from operating leases $ 1,829 $ 1,670 $ 1,522 Operating cash flows from finance leases 336 247 175 Financing cash flows from finance leases 409 221 144 Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations: Operating leases 3,677 2,303 1,571 Finance leases 3,467 2,532 1,933 83 PART II Item 8 Supplemental balance sheet information related to leases was as follows: (In millions, except lease term and discount rate) June 30, 2020 2019 Operating Leases Operating lease right-of-use assets $ 8,753 $ 7,379 Other current liabilities $ 1,616 $ 1,515 Operating lease liabilities 7,671 6,188 Total operating lease liabilities $ 9,287 $ 7,703 Finance Leases Property and equipment, at cost $ 10,371 $ 7,041 Accumulated depreciation ( 1,385 ) ( 774 ) Property and equipment, net $ 8,986 $ 6,267 Other current liabilities $ 540 $ 317 Other long-term liabilities 8,956 6,257 Total finance lease liabilities $ 9,496 $ 6,574 Weighted Average Remaining Lease Term Operating leases 8 years 7 years Finance leases 13 years 13 years Weighted Average Discount Rate Operating leases 2.7 % 3.0 % Finance leases 3.9 % 4.6 % Maturities of lease liabilities were as follows: (In millions) Year Ending June 30, Operating Leases Finance Leases 2021 $ 1,807 $ 880 2022 1,652 894 2023 1,474 903 2024 1,262 916 2025 1,000 1,236 Thereafter 3,122 7,194 Total lease payments 10,317 12,023 Less imputed interest ( 1,030 ) ( 2,527 ) Total $ 9,287 $ 9,496 As of June 30, 2020, we have additional operating and finance leases, primarily for datacenters, that have not yet commenced of $ 3.4 billion and $ 3.5 billion, respectively. These operating and finance leases will commence between fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2023 with lease terms of 1 year to 16 years . During fiscal year 2020, we recorded an impairment charge of $ 161 million to operating lease right-of-use assets due to the closing of our Microsoft Store physical locations. 84 PART II Item 8 NOTE 15 — CONTINGENCIES Patent and Intellectual Property Claims There were 64 patent infringement cases pending against Microsoft as of June 30, 2020, none of which are material individually or in aggregate. Antitrust, Unfair Competition, and Overcharge Class Actions Antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits were filed against us in British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec, Canada. All three have been certified on behalf of Canadian indirect purchasers who acquired licenses for Microsoft operating system software and/or productivity application software between 1998 and 2010. The trial of the British Columbia action commenced in May 2016. Following a mediation, the parties agreed to a global settlement of all three Canadian actions, and submitted the proposed settlement agreement to the courts in all three jurisdictions for approval. The final settlement has been approved by the courts in British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec, and the claims administration process will commence once each court approves the form of notice to the class . Other Antitrust Litigation and Claims China State Administration for Industry and Commerce Investigatio n In 2014, Microsoft was informed that China’s State Agency for Market Regulation (“SAMR”) (formerly State Administration for Industry and Commerce) had begun a formal investigation relating to China’s Anti-Monopoly Law, and the SAMR conducted onsite inspections of Microsoft offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chengdu. The SAMR has presented its preliminary views as to certain possible violations of China's Anti-Monopoly Law, and discussions are expected to continue. Product-Related Litigation U.S. Cell Phone Litigation Microsoft Mobile Oy, a subsidiary of Microsoft, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in 40 lawsuits filed in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and other adverse health effects. We assumed responsibility for these claims in our agreement to acquire Nokia’s Devices and Services business and have been substituted for the Nokia defendants. Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the U.S. Federal Communications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines (“FCC Guidelines”) are pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines. In 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plaintiffs’ expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed scientific methodologies. In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motion to exclude the plaintiffs’ general causation experts. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence. In October 2016, the Court of Appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases to the trial court for further proceedings under that standard. The plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which the defendants have moved to strike. In August 2018, the trial court issued an order striking portions of the plaintiffs’ expert reports. A hearing is expected to occur in the second quarter of fiscal year 2021 . 85 PART II Item 8 Other Contingencies We also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. As of June 30, 2020, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $ 306 million. While we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $ 500 million in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable. NOTE 16 — STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY Shares Outstanding Shares of common stock outstanding were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2020 2019 2018 Balance, beginning of year 7,643 7,677 7,708 Issued 54 116 68 Repurchased ( 126 ) ( 150 ) ( 99 ) Balance, end of year 7,571 7,643 7,677 Share Repurchases On September 20, 2016, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $ 40.0 billion in share repurchases.

NOTE 19 — SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA In its operation of the business, management, including our chief operating decision maker, who is also our Chief Executive Officer, reviews certain financial information, including segmented internal profit and loss statements prepared on a basis not consistent with GAAP. During the periods presented, we reported our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing. Our reportable segments are described below. Productivity and Business Processes Our Productivity and Business Processes segment consists of products and services in our portfolio of productivity, communication, and information services, spanning a variety of devices and platforms. This segment primarily comprises: • Office Commercial, including Office 365 subscriptions, the Office portion of Microsoft 365 Commercial subscriptions, and Office licensed on-premises, comprising Office, Exchange, SharePoint, Microsoft Teams, Office 365 Security and Compliance, and Skype for Business, and related Client Access Licenses (“CALs”). • Office Consumer, including Microsoft 365 Consumer (formerly Office 365 Consumer) subscriptions and Office licensed on-premises, and Office Consumer Services, including Skype, Outlook.com, and OneDrive. • LinkedIn, including Talent Solutions, Learning Solutions, Marketing Solutions, Sales Solutions, and Premium Subscriptions. • Dynamics business solutions, including Dynamics 365, a set of cloud-based applications across ERP and CRM, Dynamics ERP on-premises, and Dynamics CRM on-premises. Intelligent Cloud Our Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, private, and hybrid server products and cloud services that can power modern business and developers. This segment primarily comprises: • Server products and cloud services, including Azure; SQL Server, Windows Server, Visual Studio, System Center, and related CALs; and GitHub. • Enterprise Services, including Premier Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services. More Personal Computing Our More Personal Computing segment consists of products and services that put customers at the center of the experience with our technology. This segment primarily comprises: • Windows, including Windows OEM licensing and other non-volume licensing of the Windows operating system; Windows Commercial, comprising volume licensing of the Windows operating system, Windows cloud services, and other Windows commercial offerings; patent licensing; Windows Internet of Things; and MSN advertising. • Devices, including Surface and PC accessories. 90 PART II Item 8 • Gaming, including Xbox hardware and Xbox content and services, comprising Xbox Live ( transactions, subscriptions, cloud services, and advertising ), video games, and third-party video game royalties. • Search. Revenue and costs are generally directly attributed to our segments. However, due to the integrated structure of our business, certain revenue recognized and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. Revenue from certain contracts is allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services, which can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit margin. Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative revenue methodology. Operating expenses that are allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple segments benefit and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin. In addition, certain costs incurred at a corporate level that are identifiable and that benefit our segments are allocated to them. These allocated costs include costs of: legal, including settlements and fines; information technology; human resources; finance; excise taxes; field selling; shared facilities services; and customer service and support. Each allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs being allocated. Certain corporate-level activity is not allocated to our segments.

These amounts are primarily included in Office products and cloud services, Server products and cloud services, and LinkedIn in the table above. Assets are not allocated to segments for internal reporting presentations. A portion of amortization and depreciation is included with various other costs in an overhead allocation to each segment.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated July 30, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 94 PART II Item 8 Revenue Recognition – Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. The Company offers customers the ability to acquire multiple licenses of software products and services, including cloud-based services, in its customer agreements through its volume licensing programs. Significant judgment is exercised by the Company in determining revenue recognition for these customer agreements, and includes the following: • Determination of whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together, such as software licenses and related services that are sold with cloud-based services. • The pattern of delivery (i.e., timing of when revenue is recognized) for each distinct performance obligation. • Identification and treatment of contract terms that may impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized (e.g., variable consideration, optional purchases, and free services). • Determination of stand-alone selling prices for each distinct performance obligation and for products and services that are not sold separately. Given these factors and due to the volume of transactions, the related audit effort in evaluating management's judgments in determining revenue recognition for these customer agreements was extensive and required a high degree of auditor judgment. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our principal audit procedures related to the Company's revenue recognition for these customer agreements included the following: • We tested the effectiveness of controls related to the identification of distinct performance obligations, the determination of the timing of revenue recognition, and the estimation of variable consideration. • We evaluated management's significant accounting policies related to these customer agreements for reasonableness. • We selected a sample of customer agreements and performed the following procedures: – Obtained and read contract source documents for each selection, including master agreements, and other documents that were part of the agreement. – Tested management's identification and treatment of contract terms. – Assessed the terms in the customer agreement and evaluated the appropriateness of management's application of their accounting policies, along with their use of estimates, in the determination of revenue recognition conclusions. • We evaluated the reasonableness of management's estimate of stand-alone selling prices for products and services that are not sold separately. • We tested the mathematical accuracy of management's calculations of revenue and the associated timing of revenue recognized in the financial statements. 95 PART II Item 8 Income Taxes – Uncertain Tax Positions – Refer to Note 12 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company's long-term income taxes liability includes uncertain tax positions related to transfer pricing issues that remain unresolved with the Internal Revenue Service (""IRS""). The Company remains under IRS audit, or subject to IRS audit, for tax years subsequent to 2003. While the Company has settled a portion of the IRS audits, resolution of the remaining matters could have a material impact on the Company's financial statements. Conclusions on recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions involve significant estimates and management judgment and include complex considerations of the Internal Revenue Code, related regulations, tax case laws, and prior-year audit settlements. Given the complexity and the subjective nature of the transfer pricing issues that remain unresolved with the IRS, evaluating management's estimates relating to their determination of uncertain tax positions required extensive audit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment, including involvement of our tax specialists. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our principal audit procedures to evaluate management's estimates of uncertain tax positions related to unresolved transfer pricing issues included the following: • We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management's methods and assumptions used in the identification, recognition, measurement, and disclosure of uncertain tax positions, which included testing the effectiveness of the related internal controls. • We read and evaluated management's documentation, including relevant accounting policies and information obtained by management from outside tax specialists, that detailed the basis of the uncertain tax positions. • We tested the reasonableness of management's judgments regarding the future resolution of the uncertain tax positions, including an evaluation of the technical merits of the uncertain tax positions. • For those uncertain tax positions that had not been effectively settled, we evaluated whether management had appropriately considered new information that could significantly change the recognition, measurement or disclosure of the uncertain tax positions. • We evaluated the reasonableness of management's estimates by considering how tax law, including statutes, regulations and case law, impacted management's judgments. /s/ D ELOITTE & T OUCHE LLP Seattle, Washington July 30, 2020 We have served as the Company's auditor since 1983. 96 PART II Item 9, 9A ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE Not applicable. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective. REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our consolidated financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected. Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2020. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Deloitte & Touche LLP has audited our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2020; their report is included in Item 9A. 97 PART II Item 9A REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Microsoft Corporation Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries (the ""Company"") as of June 30, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2020, based on the criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements and the related notes (collectively referred to as the ""financial statements"") as of and for the year ended June 30, 2020, of the Company and our report dated July 30, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ D ELOITTE & T OUCHE LLP Seattle, Washington July 30, 2020 98 PART II, III Item 9B, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 ITEM 9B.

BUSINESS GENERAL Embracing Our Future Microsoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. We strive to create local opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world. Our platforms and tools help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness, and public-sector efficiency. They also support new startups, improve educational and health outcomes, and empower human ingenuity. We continue to transform our business to lead in the new era of the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge. We bring technology and products together into experiences and solutions that unlock value for our customers. In this next phase of innovation, computing is more powerful and ubiquitous from the cloud to the edge. Artificial intelligence (“AI”) capabilities are rapidly advancing, fueled by data and knowledge of the world. Physical and virtual worlds are coming together with the Internet of Things (“IoT”) and mixed reality to create richer experiences that understand the context surrounding people, the things they use, the places they go, and their activities and relationships. A person’s experience with technology spans a multitude of devices and has become increasingly more natural and multi-sensory with voice, ink, and gaze interactions. What We Offer Founded in 1975, we develop and support software, services, devices, and solutions that deliver new value for customers and help people and businesses realize their full potential. We offer an array of services, including cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content, and we provide solution support and consulting services. We also deliver relevant online advertising to a global audience. Our products include operating systems; cross-device productivity applications; server applications; business solution applications; desktop and server management tools; software development tools; and video games. We also design, manufacture, and sell devices, including PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories. 3 PART I Item 1 The A mbitions T hat D rive U s To achieve our vision, our research and development efforts focus on three interconnected ambitions: • Reinvent productivity and business processes. • Build the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge platform. • Create more personal computing. Reinvent Productivity and Business Processes We are in a unique position to empower people and organizations to succeed in a rapidly evolving workplace. Computing experiences are evolving, no longer bound to one device at a time. Instead, experiences are expanding to many devices as people move from home to work to on the go. These modern needs, habits, and expectations of our customers are motivating us to bring Microsoft Office 365, Windows platform, devices, including Microsoft Surface, and third-party applications into a more cohesive Microsoft 365 experience. Our growth depends on securely delivering continuous innovation and advancing our leading productivity and collaboration tools and services, including Office, Microsoft Dynamics, and LinkedIn. Microsoft 365 brings together Office 365, Windows 10, and Enterprise Mobility + Security to help organizations empower their employees with AI-backed tools that unlock creativity, increase teamwork, and fuel innovation, all the while enabling compliance coverage and data protection. Microsoft Teams is core to our vision for the modern workplace as the digital hub that creates a single canvas for teamwork, conversations, meetings, and content. Microsoft Relationship Sales solution brings together LinkedIn Sales Navigator and Dynamics to transform business to business sales through social selling. Dynamics 365 for Talent with LinkedIn Recruiter and Learning gives human resource professionals a complete solution to compete for talent. Microsoft Power Platform empowers employees to build custom applications, automate workflow, and analyze data no matter their technical expertise. These scenarios represent a move to unlock creativity and inspire teamwork, while simplifying security and management. Organizations of all sizes can now digitize business-critical functions, redefining what customers can expect from their business applications. This creates an opportunity for us to reach new customers and increase usage and engagement with existing customers. Build the Intelligent Cloud and Intelligent Edge Platform Companies are looking to use digital technology to fundamentally reimagine how they empower their employees, engage customers, optimize their operations, and change the very core of their products and services. Partnering with organizations on their digital transformation is one of our largest opportunities and we are uniquely positioned to become the strategic digital transformation platform and partner of choice. Our strategy requires continued investment in datacenters and other hybrid and edge infrastructure to support our services. Microsoft Azure is a trusted cloud with comprehensive compliance coverage and AI-based security built in. Our cloud business benefits from three economies of scale: datacenters that deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones; datacenters that coordinate and aggregate diverse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns, improving the utilization of computing, storage, and network resources; and multi-tenancy locations that lower application maintenance labor costs. As one of the two largest providers of cloud computing at scale, we believe we work from a position of strength. Being a global-scale cloud, Azure uniquely offers hybrid consistency, developer productivity, AI capabilities, and trusted security and compliance. We see more emerging use cases and needs for compute and security at the edge and are accelerating our innovation across the spectrum of intelligent edge devices, from IoT sensors to gateway devices and edge hardware to build, manage, and secure edge workloads. With Azure Stack, organizations can extend Azure into their own datacenters to create a consistent stack across the public cloud and the intelligent edge. Our hybrid infrastructure consistency spans identity, data, compute, management, and security, helping to support the real-world needs and evolving regulatory requirements of commercial customers and enterprises. We are accelerating our development of mixed reality solutions, with new Azure services and devices such as HoloLens 2. The opportunity to merge the physical and digital worlds, when combined with the power of Azure cloud services, unlocks the potential for entirely new workloads which we believe will shape the next era of computing. 4 PART I Item 1 The ability to convert data into AI drives our competitive advantage. Azure SQL Database makes it possible for cus tomers to take Microsoft SQL Server from their on-premises datacenter to a fully managed instance in the cloud to utilize built-in AI. We are accelerating adoption of AI innovations from research to products. Our innovation help s every developer be an AI d eveloper, with approachable new tools from Azure Machine Learning Studio for creating simple machine learning models, to the powerful Azure Machine Learning Workbench for the most advanced AI modeling and data science. On October 25, 2018, we completed our acquisition of GitHub, Inc. (“GitHub”), a service that millions of developers around the world rely on to write code together. The acquisition is expected to empower developers to achieve more at every stage of the development lifecycle, accelerate enterprise use of GitHub, and bring Microsoft’s developer tools and services to new audiences. Create More Personal Computing We strive to make computing more personal by putting users at the core of the experience, enabling them to interact with technology in more intuitive, engaging, and dynamic ways. In support of this, we are bringing Office, Windows, and devices together for an enhanced and more cohesive customer experience. Windows 10 continues to gain traction in the enterprise as the most secure and productive operating system. It empowers people with AI-first interfaces ranging from voice-activated commands through Cortana, inking, immersive 3D content storytelling, and mixed reality experiences. Windows also plays a critical role in fueling our cloud business and Microsoft 365 strategy, and it powers the growing range of devices on the “intelligent edge.” Our ambition for Windows 10 monetization opportunities includes gaming, services, subscriptions, and search advertising. We are committed to designing and marketing first-party devices to help drive innovation, create new device categories, and stimulate demand in the Windows ecosystem. We recently expanded our Surface family of devices with the Surface Hub 2S, which brings together Microsoft Teams, Windows, and Surface hardware to power teamwork for organizations. We are mobilizing to pursue our expansive opportunity in the gaming industry, broadening our approach to how we think about gaming end-to-end, from the way games are created and distributed to how they are played and viewed. We have a strong position with our Xbox One console, our large and growing highly engaged community of gamers on Xbox Live, and with Windows 10, the most popular operating system for PC gamers. We will continue to connect our gaming assets across PC, console, and mobile, and work to grow and engage the Xbox Live member network more deeply and frequently with services like Mixer and Xbox Game Pass. Our approach is to enable gamers to play the games they want, with the people they want, on the devices they want. Our Future Opportunity Customers are looking to us to accelerate their own digital transformations and to unlock new opportunity in this era of intelligent cloud and intelligent edge. We continue to develop complete, intelligent solutions for our customers that empower users to be creative and work together while safeguarding businesses and simplifying IT management. Our goal is to lead the industry in several distinct areas of technology over the long-term, which we expect will translate to sustained growth.

We have the opportunity to redefine what customers and partners can expect and are working to deliver new solutions that reflect the best of Microsoft. OPERATING SEGMENTS We operate our business and report our financial performance using three segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing. Our segments provide management with a comprehensive financial view of our key businesses. The segments enable the alignment of strategies and objectives across the development, sales, marketing, and services organizations, and they provide a framework for timely and rational allocation of resources within businesses. Additional information on our operating segments and geographic and product information is contained in Note 20 – Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). Our reportable segments are described below. Productivity and Business Processes Our Productivity and Business Processes segment consists of products and services in our portfolio of productivity, communication, and information services, spanning a variety of devices and platforms. This segment primarily comprises: • Office Commercial, including Office 365 subscriptions and Office licensed on-premises, comprising Office, Exchange, SharePoint, Microsoft Teams, Office 365 Security and Compliance, and Skype for Business, and related Client Access Licenses (“CALs”). • Office Consumer, including Office 365 subscriptions and Office licensed on-premises, and Office Consumer Services, including Skype, Outlook.com, and OneDrive. • LinkedIn, including Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, and Premium Subscriptions. • Dynamics business solutions, including Dynamics 365, a set of cloud-based applications across ERP and CRM, Dynamics ERP on-premises, and Dynamics CRM on-premises. Office Commercial Office Commercial is designed to increase personal, team, and organizational productivity through a range of products and services. Growth depends on our ability to reach new users in new markets such as first-line workers, small and medium businesses, and growth markets, as well as add value to our core product and service offerings to span productivity categories such as communication, collaboration, analytics, security, and compliance. Office Commercial revenue is mainly affected by a combination of continued installed base growth and average revenue per user expansion, as well as the continued shift from Office licensed on-premises to Office 365. CALs provide certain Office Commercial products and services with access rights to our server products and CAL revenue is reported with the associated Office products and services. Office Consumer Office Consumer is designed to increase personal productivity through a range of products and services. Growth depends on our ability to reach new users, add value to our core product set, and continue to expand our product and service offerings into new markets. Office Consumer revenue is mainly affected by the percentage of customers that buy Office with their new devices and the continued shift from Office licensed on-premises to Office 365. Office Consumer Services revenue is mainly affected by the demand for communication and storage through Skype, Outlook.com, and OneDrive, which is largely driven by subscriptions, advertising, and the sale of minutes. 6 PART I Item 1 LinkedIn LinkedIn connects the world's professionals to make them more productive and successful, and is the world's largest professional network on the Internet. LinkedIn offers services that can be used by customers to transform the way they hire, market, sell, and learn. In addition to LinkedIn’s free services, LinkedIn offers three categories of monetized solutions: Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, and Premium Subscriptions, which includes Sales Solutions. Talent Solutions is comprised of two elements: Hiring, and Learning and Development. Hiring provides services to recruiters that enable them to attract, recruit, and hire talent. Learning and Development provides subscriptions to enterprises and individuals to access online learning content. Marketing Solutions enables companies to advertise to LinkedIn’s member base. Premium Subscriptions enables professionals to manage their professional identity, grow their network, and connect with talent through additional services like premium search. Premium Subscriptions also includes Sales Solutions, which helps sales professionals find, qualify, and create sales opportunities and accelerate social selling capabilities. Growth will depend on our ability to increase the number of LinkedIn members and our ability to continue offering services that provide value for our members and increase their engagement. LinkedIn revenue is mainly affected by demand from enterprises and professional organizations for subscriptions to Talent Solutions and Premium Subscriptions offerings, as well as member engagement and the quality of the sponsored content delivered to those members to drive Marketing Solutions. On November 16, 2018, LinkedIn acquired Glint, an employee engagement platform, to expand its Talent Solutions offerings. Dynamics Dynamics provides cloud-based and on-premises business solutions for financial management, enterprise resource planning (“ERP”), customer relationship management (“CRM”), supply chain management, and analytics applications for small and medium businesses, large organizations, and divisions of global enterprises. Dynamics revenue is driven by the number of users licensed, expansion of average revenue per user, and the continued shift to Dynamics 365, a unified set of cloud-based intelligent business applications. Competition Competitors to Office include software and global application vendors, such as Apple, Cisco Systems, Facebook, Google, IBM, Okta, Proofpoint, Slack, Symantec, Zoom, and numerous web-based and mobile application competitors as well as local application developers. Apple distributes versions of its pre-installed application software, such as email and calendar products, through its PCs, tablets, and phones. Cisco Systems is using its position in enterprise communications equipment to grow its unified communications business. Google provides a hosted messaging and productivity suite. Slack provides teamwork and collaboration software. Zoom offers videoconferencing and cloud phone solutions. Skype for Business and Skype also compete with a variety of instant messaging, voice, and video communication providers, ranging from start-ups to established enterprises. Okta, Proofpoint, and Symantec provide security solutions across email security, information protection, identity, and governance. Web-based offerings competing with individual applications have also positioned themselves as alternatives to our products and services. We compete by providing powerful, flexible, secure, integrated industry-specific, and easy-to-use productivity and collaboration tools and services that create comprehensive solutions and work well with technologies our customers already have both on-premises or in the cloud. LinkedIn faces competition from online recruiting companies, talent management companies, and larger companies that are focusing on talent management and human resource services; job boards; traditional recruiting firms; and companies that provide learning and development products and services. Marketing Solutions competes with online and offline outlets that generate revenue from advertisers and marketers. Dynamics competes with vendors such as Infor, NetSuite, Oracle, Salesforce.com, SAP, and The Sage Group to provide cloud-based and on-premise business solutions for small, medium, and large organizations. 7 PART I Item 1 Intelligent Cloud Our Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, private, and hybrid server products and cloud services that can power modern business. This segment primarily comprises: • Server products and cloud services, including SQL Server, Windows Server, Visual Studio, System Center, and related CALs, GitHub, and Azure. • Enterprise Services, including Premier Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services. Server Products and Cloud Services Our server products are designed to make IT professionals, developers, and their systems more productive and efficient. Server software is integrated server infrastructure and middleware designed to support software applications built on the Windows Server operating system. This includes the server platform, database, business intelligence, storage, management and operations, virtualization, service-oriented architecture platform, security, and identity software. We also license standalone and software development lifecycle tools for software architects, developers, testers, and project managers. GitHub provides a collaboration platform and code hosting service for developers. Server products revenue is mainly affected by purchases through volume licensing programs, licenses sold to original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”), and retail packaged products. CALs provide access rights to certain server products, including SQL Server and Windows Server, and revenue is reported along with the associated server product. Azure is a comprehensive set of cloud services that offer developers, IT professionals, and enterprises freedom to build, deploy, and manage applications on any platform or device. Customers can use Azure through our global network of datacenters for computing, networking, storage, mobile and web application services, AI, IoT, cognitive services, and machine learning. Azure enables customers to devote more resources to development and use of applications that benefit their organizations, rather than managing on-premises hardware and software. Azure revenue is mainly affected by infrastructure-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service consumption-based services, and per user-based services such as Enterprise Mobility + Security. Enterprise Services Enterprise Services, including Premier Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services, assist customers in developing, deploying, and managing Microsoft server and desktop solutions and provide training and certification to developers and IT professionals on various Microsoft products. Competition Our server products face competition from a wide variety of server operating systems and applications offered by companies with a range of market approaches. Vertically integrated computer manufacturers such as Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and Oracle offer their own versions of the Unix operating system preinstalled on server hardware. Nearly all computer manufacturers offer server hardware for the Linux operating system and many contribute to Linux operating system development. The competitive position of Linux has also benefited from the large number of compatible applications now produced by many commercial and non-commercial software developers. A number of companies, such as Red Hat, supply versions of Linux. We compete to provide enterprise-wide computing solutions and point solutions with numerous commercial software vendors that offer solutions and middleware technology platforms, software applications for connectivity (both Internet and intranet), security, hosting, database, and e-business servers. IBM and Oracle lead a group of companies focused on the Java Platform Enterprise Edition that competes with our enterprise-wide computing solutions. Commercial competitors for our server applications for PC-based distributed client-server environments include CA Technologies, IBM, and Oracle. Our web application platform software competes with open source software such as Apache, Linux, MySQL, and PHP. In middleware, we compete against Java vendors. Our database, business intelligence, and data warehousing solutions offerings compete with products from IBM, Oracle, SAP, and other companies. Our system management solutions compete with server management and server virtualization platform providers, such as BMC, CA Technologies, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, and VMware. Our products for software developers compete against offerings from Adobe, IBM, Oracle, and other companies, and also against open-source projects, including Eclipse (sponsored by CA Technologies, IBM, Oracle, and SAP), PHP, and Ruby on Rails. 8 PART I Item 1 We believe our server products provide customers with advantages in performance, total costs of ownership, and productivity by delivering superior applications, development tools, compatibility with a broad base of hardware a nd software applications, security, and manageability. Azure faces diverse competition from companies such as Amazon, Google, IBM, Oracle, Salesforce.com, VMware, and open source offerings. Our Enterprise Mobility + Security offerings also compete with products from a range of competitors including identity vendors, security solution vendors, and numerous other security point solution vendors. Azure’s competitive advantage includes enabling a hybrid cloud, allowing deployment of existing datacenters with our public cloud into a single, cohesive infrastructure, and the ability to run at a scale that meets the needs of businesses of all sizes and complexities. We believe our cloud’s global scale, coupled with our broad portfolio of identity and security solutions, allows us to effectively solve complex cybersecurity challenges for our customers and differentiates us from the competition. Our Enterprise Services business competes with a wide range of companies that provide strategy and business planning, application development, and infrastructure services, including multinational consulting firms and small niche businesses focused on specific technologies. More Personal Computing Our More Personal Computing segment consists of products and services geared towards harmonizing the interests of end users, developers, and IT professionals across all devices. This segment primarily comprises: • Windows, including Windows OEM licensing (“Windows OEM”) and other non-volume licensing of the Windows operating system; Windows Commercial, comprising volume licensing of the Windows operating system, Windows cloud services, and other Windows commercial offerings; patent licensing; Windows IoT; and MSN advertising. • Devices, including Surface, PC accessories, and other intelligent devices. • Gaming, including Xbox hardware and Xbox software and services, comprising Xbox Live transactions, subscriptions, cloud services, and advertising (“Xbox Live”), video games, and third-party video game royalties. • Search. Windows The Windows operating system is designed to deliver a more personal computing experience for users by enabling consistency of experience, applications, and information across their devices. Windows OEM revenue is impacted significantly by the number of Windows operating system licenses purchased by OEMs, which they pre-install on the devices they sell. In addition to computing device market volume, Windows OEM revenue is impacted by: • The mix of computing devices based on form factor and screen size. • Differences in device market demand between developed markets and growth markets. • Attachment of Windows to devices shipped. • Customer mix between consumer, small and medium businesses, and large enterprises. • Changes in inventory levels in the OEM channel. • Pricing changes and promotions, pricing variation that occurs when the mix of devices manufactured shifts from local and regional system builders to large multinational OEMs, and different pricing of Windows versions licensed. • Constraints in the supply chain of device components. • Piracy. Windows Commercial revenue, which includes volume licensing of the Windows operating system and Windows cloud services such as Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection, is affected mainly by the demand from commercial customers for volume licensing and Software Assurance (“SA”), as well as advanced security offerings. Windows Commercial revenue often reflects the number of information workers in a licensed enterprise and is relatively independent of the number of PCs sold in a given year. 9 PART I Item 1 Patent licensing includes our programs to license patents we own for use across a broad array of technology areas, including mobile devices and cloud offerings. Windows IoT extends the power of Windows and the cloud to intelligent systems by delivering specialized operating systems, tools, and services for use in embedded devices. MSN advertising includes both native and display ads. Devices We design, manufacture, and sell devices, including Surface, PC accessories, and other intelligent devices. Our devices are designed to enable people and organizations to connect to the people and content that matter most using Windows and integrated Microsoft products and services. Surface is designed to help organizations, students, and consumers be more productive. Gaming Our gaming platform is designed to provide a unique variety of entertainment using our devices, peripherals, applications, online services, and content. We released Xbox One S and Xbox One X in August 2016 and November 2017, respectively. With the launch of the Mixer service in May 2017, offering interactive live streaming, and Xbox Game Pass in June 2017, providing unlimited access to over 100 Xbox titles, we continue to open new opportunities for customers to engage both on- and off-console. With our acquisition of PlayFab in January 2018, we enable worldwide game developers to utilize game services, LiveOps, and analytics for player acquisition, engagement, and retention. We have also made these services available for developers outside of the gaming industry. Xbox Live enables people to connect and share online gaming experiences and is accessible on Xbox consoles, Windows-enabled devices, and other devices. Xbox Live is designed to benefit users by providing access to a network of certified applications and services and to benefit our developer and partner ecosystems by providing access to a large customer base. Xbox Live revenue is mainly affected by subscriptions and sales of Xbox Live enabled content, as well as advertising. We also continue to design and sell gaming content to showcase our unique platform capabilities for Xbox consoles, Windows-enabled devices, and other devices. Growth of our Gaming business is determined by the overall active user base through Xbox Live enabled content, availability of games, providing exclusive game content that gamers seek, the computational power and reliability of the devices used to access our content and services, and the ability to create new experiences via online services including game streaming, downloadable content, and peripherals. Search Our Search business, including Bing and Microsoft Advertising, is designed to deliver relevant online advertising to a global audience. We have several partnerships with other companies, including Verizon Media Group, through which we provide and monetize search queries. Growth depends on our ability to attract new users, understand intent, and match intent with relevant content and advertiser offerings. Competition Windows faces competition from various software products and from alternative platforms and devices, mainly from Apple and Google. We believe Windows competes effectively by giving customers choice, value, flexibility, security, an easy-to-use interface, and compatibility with a broad range of hardware and software applications, including those that enable productivity. Devices face competition from various computer, tablet, and hardware manufacturers who offer a unique combination of high-quality industrial design and innovative technologies across various price points. These manufacturers, many of which are also current or potential partners and customers, include Apple and our Windows OEMs. 10 PART I Item 1 Our gaming platform competes with console platforms from Nintendo and Sony , both of which have a large, established base of customers. The lifecycle for gaming and entertainment consoles averages five to ten years. Nintendo released its latest generation console in March 2017 and Sony released its latest generation console in November 2013. We also compete with other providers of entertainment services through online marketplaces. We believe our gaming pla tform is effectively positioned against competitive products and services based on significant innovation in hardware architecture, user interface, developer tools, online gaming and entertainment services, and continued strong exclusive content from our o wn game franchises as well as other digital content offerings. Our video games competitors include Electronic Arts and Activision Blizzard. Xbox Live and our cloud gaming services face competition from various online marketplaces, including those operated by Amazon, Apple, and Google. Our search business competes with Google and a wide array of websites, social platforms like Facebook, and portals that provide content and online offerings to end users. OPERATIONS We have operations centers that support operations in their regions, including customer contract and order processing, credit and collections, information processing, and vendor management and logistics. The regional center in Ireland supports the European, Middle Eastern, and African region; the center in Singapore supports the Japan, India, Greater China, and Asia-Pacific region; and the centers in Fargo, North Dakota, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Puerto Rico, Redmond, Washington, and Reno, Nevada support Latin America and North America. In addition to the operations centers, we also operate datacenters throughout the Americas, Europe, Australia, and Asia, as well as in the Middle East and Africa. To serve the needs of customers around the world and to improve the quality and usability of products in international markets, we localize many of our products to reflect local languages and conventions. Localizing a product may require modifying the user interface, altering dialog boxes, and translating text. Our devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract manufacturers. We generally have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes unavailable or unable to meet our requirements. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Product and Service Development, and Intellectual Property We develop most of our products and services internally through the following engineering groups. • Cloud and AI , focuses on making IT professionals, developers, and their systems more productive and efficient through development of cloud infrastructure, server, database, CRM, ERP, management and development tools, AI cognitive services, and other business process applications and services for enterprises. • Experiences and Devices , focuses on instilling a unifying product ethos across our end-user experiences and devices, including Office, Windows, Enterprise Mobility and Management, and Surface. • AI and Research , focuses on our AI innovations and other forward-looking research and development efforts spanning infrastructure, services, applications, and search. • LinkedIn , focuses on our services that transform the way customers hire, market, sell, and learn. • Gaming , focuses on connecting gaming assets across the range of devices to grow and engage the Xbox Live member network through game experiences, streaming content, and social interaction. Internal development allows us to maintain competitive advantages that come from product differentiation and closer technical control over our products and services. It also gives us the freedom to decide which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented. We strive to obtain information as early as possible about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software and hardware design. Before releasing new software platforms, and as we make significant modifications to existing platforms, we provide application vendors with a range of resources and guidelines for development, training, and testing. Generally, we also create product documentation internally. 11 PART I Item 1 We protect our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways. We work actively in the U.S. and internatio nally to ensure the enforcement of copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other protections that apply to our software and hardware products, services, business plans, and branding. We are a leader among technology companies in pursuing patents and curren tly have a portfolio of over 61,000 U.S. and international patents issued and over 26,000 pending. While we employ much of our internally- developed intellectual property exclusively in our products and services, we also engage in outbound licensing of spec ific patented technologies that are incorporated into licensees’ products. From time to time, we enter into broader cross-license agreements with other technology companies covering entire groups of patents. We also purchase or license technology that we i ncorporate into our products and services. At times, we make select intellectual property broadly available at no or low cost to achieve a strategic objective, such as promoting industry standards, advancing interoperability, or attracting and enabling our external development community. Our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products, services, and business methods, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. We believe our continuing research and product development are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with a third party relating to the development of our products. Investing in the Future Our success is based on our ability to create new and compelling products, services, and experiences for our users, to initiate and embrace disruptive technology trends, to enter new geographic and product markets, and to drive broad adoption of our products and services. We invest in a range of emerging technology trends and breakthroughs that we believe offer significant opportunities to deliver value to our customers and growth for the Company. Based on our assessment of key technology trends, we maintain our long-term commitment to research and development across a wide spectrum of technologies, tools, and platforms spanning digital work and life experiences, cloud computing, AI, devices, and operating systems. While our main research and development facilities are located in Redmond, Washington, we also operate research and development facilities in other parts of the U.S. and around the world, including Canada, China, Czech Republic, India, Ireland, Israel, and the United Kingdom. This global approach helps us remain competitive in local markets and enables us to continue to attract top talent from across the world. We generally fund research at the corporate level to ensure that we are looking beyond immediate product considerations to opportunities further in the future. We also fund research and development activities at the operating segment level. Much of our segment level research and development is coordinated with other segments and leveraged across the Company. In addition to our main research and development operations, we also operate Microsoft Research. Microsoft Research is one of the world’s largest corporate research organizations and works in close collaboration with top universities around the world to advance the state-of-the-art in computer science and a broad range of other disciplines, providing us a unique perspective on future trends and contributing to our innovation. We plan to continue to make significant investments in a broad range of research and development efforts. DISTRIBUTION, SALES, AND MARKETING We market and distribute our products and services through the following channels: OEMs, direct, and distributors and resellers. Our sales force performs a variety of functions, including working directly with enterprises and public-sector organizations worldwide to identify and meet their technology requirements; managing OEM relationships; and supporting system integrators, independent software vendors, and other partners who engage directly with our customers to perform sales, consulting, and fulfillment functions for our products and services. OEMs We distribute our products and services through OEMs that pre-install our software on new devices and servers they sell. The largest component of the OEM business is the Windows operating system pre-installed on devices. OEMs also sell devices pre-installed with other Microsoft products and services, including applications such as Office and the capability to subscribe to Office 365. 12 PART I Item 1 There are two broad categories of OEMs. The largest category of OEMs are direct OEMs as our relationship with them is managed through a di rect agreement between Microsoft and the OEM. We have distribution agreements covering one or more of our products with virtually all the multinational OEMs, including Acer, ASUS, Dell, Fujitsu, Hewlett-Packard, Lenovo, Samsung, Sharp, Toshiba, and with ma ny regional and local OEMs. The second broad category of OEMs are system builders consisting of lower-volume PC manufacturers, which source Microsoft software for pre-installation and local redistribution primarily through the Microsoft distributor channel rather than through a direct agreement or relationship with Microsoft. Direct Many organizations that license our products and services transact directly with us through Enterprise Agreements and Enterprise Services contracts, with sales support from system integrators, independent software vendors, web agencies, and partners that advise organizations on licensing our products and services (“Enterprise Agreement Software Advisors” or “ESA”). Microsoft offers direct sales programs targeted to reach small, medium, and corporate customers, in addition to those offered through the reseller channel. A large network of partner advisors support many of these sales. We also sell commercial and consumer products and services directly to customers, such as cloud services, search, and gaming, through our digital marketplaces, online stores, and retail stores. Distributors and Resellers Organizations also license our products and services indirectly, primarily through licensing solution partners (“LSP”), distributors, value-added resellers (“VAR”), and retailers. Although each type of reselling partner may reach organizations of all sizes, LSPs are primarily engaged with large organizations, distributors resell primarily to VARs, and VARs typically reach small and medium organizations. ESAs are also typically authorized as LSPs and operate as resellers for our other volume licensing programs. Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider is our main partner program for reselling cloud services. We distribute our retail packaged products primarily through independent non-exclusive distributors, authorized replicators, resellers, and retail outlets. Individual consumers obtain these products primarily through retail outlets. We distribute our devices through third-party retailers. We have a network of field sales representatives and field support personnel that solicit orders from distributors and resellers, and provide product training and sales support. Our Dynamics business solutions are also licensed to enterprises through a global network of channel partners providing vertical solutions and specialized services. LICENSING OPTIONS We offer options for organizations that want to purchase our cloud services, on-premises software, and Software Assurance. We license software to organizations under volume licensing agreements to allow the customer to acquire multiple licenses of products and services instead of having to acquire separate licenses through retail channels. We use different programs designed to provide flexibility for organizations of various sizes. While these programs may differ in various parts of the world, generally they include those discussed below. SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades for perpetual licenses released over the contract period. It also provides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use software efficiently. SA is included with certain volume licensing agreements and is an optional purchase with others. Volume Licensing Programs Enterprise Agreement Enterprise Agreements offer large organizations a manageable volume licensing program that gives them the flexibility to buy cloud services and software licenses under one agreement. Enterprise Agreements are designed for medium or large organizations that want to license cloud services and on-premises software organization-wide over a three-year period. Organizations can elect to purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses. SA is included. 13 PART I Item 1 Microsoft Product and Services Agreement Microsoft Product and Services Agreements are designed for medium and large organizations that want to license cloud services and on-premises software as needed, with no organization-wide commitment, under a single, non-expiring agreement. Organizations purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses. SA is optional for customers that purchase perpetual licenses. Open Open agreements are a simple, cost-effective way to acquire the latest Microsoft technology. Open agreements are designed for small and medium organizations that want to license cloud services and on-premises software over a one- to three-year period. Under the Open agreements, organizations purchase perpetual licenses and SA is optional. Under Open Value agreements, organizations can elect to purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses and SA is included. Select Plus Select Plus agreements are designed for government and academic organizations to acquire on-premises licenses at any affiliate or department level, while realizing advantages as one organization. Organizations purchase perpetual licenses and SA is optional. Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement Microsoft Online Subscription Agreements are designed for small and medium organizations that want to subscribe to, activate, provision, and maintain cloud services seamlessly and directly via the web. The agreement allows customers to acquire monthly or annual subscriptions for cloud-based services. Partner Programs The Microsoft Cloud Solution Provider program offers customers an easy way to license the cloud services they need in combination with the value-added services offered by their systems integrator, hosting partner, or cloud reseller partner. Partners in this program can easily package their own products and services to directly provision, manage, and support their customer subscriptions. The Microsoft Services Provider License Agreement allows service providers and independent software vendors who want to license eligible Microsoft software products to provide software services and hosted applications to their end customers. Partners license software over a three-year period and are billed monthly based on consumption. The Independent Software Vendor Royalty program enables partners to integrate Microsoft products into other applications and then license the unified business solution to their end users. CUSTOMERS Our customers include individual consumers, small and medium organizations, large global enterprises, public-sector institutions, Internet service providers, application developers, and OEMs. Our practice is to ship our products promptly upon receipt of purchase orders from customers; consequently, backlog is not significant. 14 PART I Item 1 EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT Our executive officers as of July 31, 2019 were as follows: Name Age Position with the Company Satya Nadella 51 Chief Executive Officer Christopher C.

Archives of these events are also available. • Press releases on quarterly earnings, product and service announcements, legal developments, and international news. • Corporate governance information including our articles of incorporation, bylaws, governance guidelines, committee charters, codes of conduct and ethics, global corporate social responsibility initiatives, and other governance-related policies. • Other news and announcements that we may post from time to time that investors might find useful or interesting. • Opportunities to sign up for email alerts to have information pushed in real time. The information found on our website is not part of this or any other report we file with, or furnish to, the SEC. In addition to these channels, we use social media to communicate to the public. It is possible that the information we post on social media could be deemed to be material to investors. We encourage investors, the media, and others interested in Microsoft to review the information we post on the social media channels listed on our Investor Relations website. 16 PART I Item 1A ITEM 1A. RIS K FACTORS Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock. We face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins. Competition in the technology sector Our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small, specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical, marketing, and financial resources. Barriers to entry in many of our businesses are low and many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative products, devices, and services that appeal to businesses and consumers. Competition among platform-based ecosystems An important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many participants can build diverse solutions. A well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users, application developers, and the platform provider that can accelerate growth. Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins. We face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms. • A competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements of a product and related services, has succeeded with some consumer products such as personal computers, tablets, phones, gaming consoles, wearables, and other endpoint devices. Competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform, including applications and content sold through their integrated marketplaces. They may also be able to claim security and performance benefits from their vertically integrated offer. We also offer some vertically-integrated hardware and software products and services. To the extent we shift a portion of our business to a vertically integrated model we increase our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margins. • We derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on personal computers. We face significant competition from competing platforms developed for new devices and form factors such as smartphones and tablet computers. These devices compete on multiple bases including price and the perceived utility of the device and its platform. Users are increasingly turning to these devices to perform functions that in the past were performed by personal computers. Even if many users view these devices as complementary to a personal computer, the prevalence of these devices may make it more difficult to attract application developers to our PC operating system platforms. Competing with operating systems licensed at low or no cost may decrease our PC operating system margins. Popular products or services offered on competing platforms could increase their competitive strength. In addition, some of our devices compete with products made by our original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) partners, which may affect their commitment to our platform. • Competing platforms have content and application marketplaces with scale and significant installed bases. The variety and utility of content and applications available on a platform are important to device purchasing decisions. Users may incur costs to move data and buy new content and applications when switching platforms. To compete, we must successfully enlist developers to write applications for our platform and ensure that these applications have high quality, security, customer appeal, and value. Efforts to compete with competitors’ content and application marketplaces may increase our cost of revenue and lower our operating margins. 17 PART I Item 1A Business model competition Companies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models. • Even as we transition more of our business to infrastructure-, platform-, and software-as-a-service business model, the license-based proprietary software model generates a substantial portion of our software revenue. We bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenue received from licensing our products. Many of our competitors also develop and sell software to businesses and consumers under this model. • Other competitors develop and offer free applications, online services and content, and make money by selling third-party advertising. Advertising revenue funds development of products and services these competitors provide to users at no or little cost, competing directly with our revenue-generating products. • Some companies compete with us by modifying and then distributing open source software at little or no cost to end-users, and earning revenue on advertising or integrated products and services. These firms do not bear the full costs of research and development for the open source software. Some open source software mimics the features and functionality of our products. The competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for research and development, marketing, and sales incentives. This may lead to lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income. Our increasing focus on cloud-based services presents execution and competitive risks. A growing part of our business involves cloud-based services available across the spectrum of computing devices. Our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building best-in-class platforms and productivity services for an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with artificial intelligence (“AI”). At the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and business customers. Pricing and delivery models are evolving. Devices and form factors influence how users access services in the cloud and sometimes the user’s choice of which cloud-based services to use. We are devoting significant resources to develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies. The Windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment. We are undertaking cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation. Our intelligent cloud and intelligent edge worldview is connected with the growth of the Internet of Things (“IoT”). Our success in the IoT will depend on the level of adoption of our offerings such as Microsoft Azure, Azure Stack, Azure IoT Edge, and Azure Sphere. We may not establish market share sufficient to achieve scale necessary to achieve our business objectives. Besides software development costs, we are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services. These costs will reduce the operating margins we have previously achieved. Whether we succeed in cloud-based services depends on our execution in several areas, including: • Continuing to bring to market compelling cloud-based experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share. • Maintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance of our cloud-based services on the growing array of computing devices, including PCs, smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, and other devices, as well as sensors and other endpoints. • Continuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third-party developers. • Ensuring our cloud-based services meet the reliability expectations of our customers and maintain the security of their data. • Making our suite of cloud-based services platform-agnostic, available on a wide range of devices and ecosystems, including those of our competitors. It is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed. If we are not effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services, we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above. This may negatively impact gross margins and operating income. 18 PART I Item 1A We make significant investments in products and services that may not achieve expected returns. We will continue to make significant investments in research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the Windows operating system, Microsoft 365, Office, Bing, Microsoft SQL Server, Windows Server, Azure, Office 365, Xbox Live, Mixer, LinkedIn, and other p roducts and services. We also invest in the development and acquisition of a variety of hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment including PCs, tablets, gaming devices, and HoloLens. Investments in new technology are speculative. Commerc ial success depends on many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. If customers do not perceive our latest offerings as providing significant new functionality or other value, they may reduce their p urchases of new software and hardware products or upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. We may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, if at all. New products and services may no t be profitable, and even if they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses will not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically. We may not get engagement in certain features, like Microsoft Edge and Bing, that drive post- sale monetization opportunities. Our data handling practices across our products and services will continue to be under scrutiny and perceptions of mismanagement, driven by regulatory activity or negative public reaction to our practices or prod uct experiences, which could negatively impact product and feature adoption, product design , and product quality. Developing new technologies is complex. It can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays in new releases or significant problems in creating new products or services could adversely affect our revenue. Acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business. We expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. In December 2016, we completed our acquisition of LinkedIn Corporation (“LinkedIn”) for $27.0 billion, and in October 2018, we completed our acquisition of GitHub, Inc. for $7.5 billion. These acquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks, including that they do not advance our business strategy, that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment, that we have difficulty integrating and retaining new employees, business systems, and technology, or that they distract management from our other businesses. If an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests of a party, it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement. The success of these transactions and arrangements will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing products and services or develop compelling new ones. It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements such as increased revenue or enhanced efficiencies, or the benefits may ultimately be smaller than we expected. These events could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements. If our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings. We acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. We review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable, include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate. We have in the past recorded, and may in the future be required to record a significant charge on our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively affecting our results of operations. Our acquisition of LinkedIn resulted in a significant increase in our goodwill and intangible asset balances. 19 PART I Item 1A Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or harm to our reputation or competitive position. Security of our information technology Threats to IT security can take a variety of forms. Individual and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including state-sponsored organizations or nation-states, continuously undertake attacks that pose threats to our customers and our IT. These actors may use a wide variety of methods, which may include developing and deploying malicious software or exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware, software, or other infrastructure in order to attack our products and services or gain access to our networks and datacenters, using social engineering techniques to induce our employees, users, partners, or customers to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions to gain access to our data or our users’ or customers’ data, or acting in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks. Inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access to confidential data. For example, system administrators may fail to timely remove employee account access when no longer appropriate. Employees or third parties may intentionally compromise our or our users’ security or systems, or reveal confidential information. Cyberthreats are constantly evolving, increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. We may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerabilities, which may allow them to persist in the environment over long periods of time. Cyberthreats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those of our partners and customers. Breaches of our facilities, network, or data security could disrupt the security of our systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and protect the privacy of their data, result in product development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other assets, require us to allocate more resources to improved technologies, or otherwise adversely affect our business. In addition, our internal IT environment continues to evolve. Often, we are early adopters of new devices and technologies. We embrace new ways of sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such as social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies. Our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes as new threats emerge. Security of our products, services, devices, and customers’ data The security of our products and services is important in our customers’ decisions to purchase or use our products or services. Security threats are a significant challenge to companies like us whose business is providing technology products and services to others. Threats to our own IT infrastructure can also affect our customers. Customers using our cloud-based services rely on the security of our infrastructure, including hardware and other elements provided by third parties, to ensure the reliability of our services and the protection of their data. Adversaries tend to focus their efforts on the most popular operating systems, programs, and services, including many of ours, and we expect that to continue. Adversaries that acquire user account information at other companies can use that information to compromise our users’ accounts where accounts share the same attributes like passwords. Inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access. We are also increasingly incorporating open source software into our products. There may be vulnerabilities in open source software that may make our products susceptible to cyberattacks. To defend against security threats to our internal IT systems, our cloud-based services, and our customers’ systems, we must continuously engineer more secure products and services, enhance security and reliability features, improve the deployment of software updates to address security vulnerabilities in our own products as well as those provided by others, develop mitigation technologies that help to secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network, products, and services, and provide security tools such as firewalls and anti-virus software and information about the need to deploy security measures and the impact of doing so. 20 PART I Item 1A The cost of these steps could reduc e our operating margins. If we fail to do these things well, actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services, data corruption issues, or reduced performance could harm our reputation and lead customers to reduce or delay future pu rchases of products or subscriptions to services, or to use competing products or services. Customers may also spend more on protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption of additional products or services. Customers ma y fail to update their systems, continue to run software or operating systems we no longer support, or may fail timely to install or enable security patches. Any of these could adversely affect our reputation and revenue. Actual or perceived vulnerabilitie s may lead to claims against us. Our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, but there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges. At times, to achieve commercial objectives, we may enter into agreements with larger liability exposure to customers. As illustrated by the Spectre and Meltdown threats, our products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem of third parties. If there is a security vulnerability in one of these components, and if there is a security exploit targeting it, we could face increased costs, liability claims, reduced revenue, or harm to our reputation or competitive position. Disclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation. As we continue to grow the number and scale of our cloud-based offerings, we store and process increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable information of our customers and users. The continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. Despite our efforts to improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and third parties on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure or misuse of customer or user data we or our vendors store and manage. In addition, third parties who have limited access to our customer or user data may use this data in unauthorized ways. Improper disclosure or misuse could harm our reputation, lead to legal exposure to customers or users, or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue. Our software products and services also enable our customers and users to store and process personal data on-premises or, increasingly, in a cloud-based environment we host. Government authorities can sometimes require us to produce customer or user data in response to valid legal orders. In the U.S. and elsewhere, we advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations on government authority to compel disclosure. Despite our efforts to protect customer and user data, perceptions that the collection, use, and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales of our products or services, and could limit adoption of our cloud-based solutions by consumers, businesses, and government entities. Additional security measures we may take to address customer or user concerns, or constraints on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer or user expectations or governmental rules or actions, may cause higher operating expenses or hinder growth of our products and services. We may not be able to protect information in our products and services from use by others . LinkedIn and other Microsoft products and services contain valuable information and content protected by contractual restrictions or technical measures. In certain cases, we have made commitments to our members and users to limit access to or use of this information. Changes in the law or interpretations of the law may weaken our ability to prevent third parties from scraping or gathering information or content through use of bots or other measures and using it for their own benefit, thus diminishing the value of our products and services. Abuse of our platforms may harm our reputation or user engagement. Advertising, professional, and social platform abuses For LinkedIn, Microsoft Advertising, MSN, Xbox Live, and other products and services that provide content or host ads that come from or can be influenced by third parties, our reputation or user engagement may be negatively affected by activity that is hostile or inappropriate. This activity may come from users impersonating other people or organizations, use of our products or services to spread terrorist or violent extremist content or to disseminate information that may be viewed as misleading or intended to manipulate the opinions of our users, or the use of our products or services that violates our terms of service or otherwise for objectionable or illegal ends. Preventing or responding to these actions may require us to make substantial investments in people and technology and these investments may not be successful, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements. 21 PART I Item 1A Harmful content online Our hosted consumer services as well as our enterprise services may be used by third parties to disseminate harmful or illegal content in violation of our terms or applicable law. We may not proactively discover such content due to scale and the limitations of existing technologies, and when discovered by users, such content may negatively affect our reputation, our brands, and user engagement. Regulations and other initiatives to make platforms responsible for preventing or eliminating harmful content online are gaining momentum and we expect this to continue. We may be subject to enhanced regulatory oversight, substantial liability, or reputational damage if we fail to comply with content moderation regulations, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements. The development of the IoT presents security, privacy, and execution risks. To support the growth of the intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge, we are developing products, services, and technologies to power the IoT, a network of distributed and interconnected devices employing sensors, data, and computing capabilities including AI. The IoT’s great potential also carries substantial risks. IoT products and services may contain defects in design, manufacture, or operation, that make them insecure or ineffective for their intended purposes. An IoT solution has multiple layers of hardware, sensors, processors, software, and firmware, several of which we may not develop or control. Each layer, including the weakest layer, can impact the security of the whole system. Many IoT devices have limited interfaces and ability to be updated or patched. IoT solutions may collect large amounts of data, and our handling of IoT data may not satisfy customers or regulatory requirements. IoT scenarios may increasingly affect personal health and safety. If IoT solutions that include our technologies do not work as intended, violate the law, or harm individuals or businesses, we may be subject to legal claims or enforcement actions. These risks, if realized, may increase our costs, damage our reputation or brands, or negatively impact our revenues or margins. Issues in the use of AI in our offerings may result in reputational harm or liability . We are building AI into many of our offerings and we expect this element of our business to grow. We envision a future in which AI operating in our devices, applications, and the cloud helps our customers be more productive in their work and personal lives. As with many disruptive innovations, AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. AI algorithms may be flawed. Datasets may be insufficient or contain biased information. Inappropriate or controversial data practices by Microsoft or others could impair the acceptance of AI solutions. These deficiencies could undermine the decisions, predictions, or analysis AI applications produce, subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability, and brand or reputational harm. Some AI scenarios present ethical issues. If we enable or offer AI solutions that are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or other social issues, we may experience brand or reputational harm. We may have excessive outages, data losses, and disruptions of our online services if we fail to maintain an adequate operations infrastructure. Our increasing user traffic, growth in services, and the complexity of our products and services demand more computing power. We spend substantial amounts to build, purchase, or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our websites and in our datacenters. These demands continue to increase as we introduce new products and services and support the growth of existing services such as Bing, Azure, Microsoft Account services, Office 365, Microsoft Teams, Dynamics 365, OneDrive, SharePoint Online, Skype, Xbox Live, and Outlook.com. We are rapidly growing our business of providing a platform and back-end hosting for services provided by third parties to their end users. Maintaining, securing, and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex. It requires that we maintain an Internet connectivity infrastructure that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue to evolve. Inefficiencies or operational failures, including temporary or permanent loss of customer data or insufficient Internet connectivity, could diminish the quality of our products, services, and user experience resulting in contractual liability, claims by customers and other third parties, regulatory actions, damage to our reputation, and loss of current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each of which may adversely impact our consolidated financial statements. We may experience quality or supply problems. Our hardware products such as Xbox consoles, Surface devices, and other devices we design, manufacture, and market are highly complex and can have defects in design, manufacture, or associated software. We could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm as a result of recalls, safety alerts, or product liability claims if we fail to prevent, detect, or address such issues through design, testing, or warranty repairs. 22 PART I Item 1A Our software products and services also may experience quality or reliability problems. The highly sophis ticated software we develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. Our customers increasingly rely on us for critical functions, potentially magnifying the impact of quality or reliability issues. Any defects we do not detect and fix in pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue, damage to our reputation, repair or remediation costs, delays in the release of new products or versions, or legal liability. Although our license agreements typically contai n provisions that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability, there is no assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge. We acquire some device and datacenter components from sole suppliers. Our competitors use some of the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available to us. If a component from a sole-source supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable, whether because of supplier capacity constraint, industry shortages, legal or regulatory changes, or other reasons, we may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting in reduced sales or inadequate datacenter capacity. Component shortages, excess or obsolete inventory, or price reductions resulting in inventory adjustments may increase our cost of revenue. Xbox consoles, Surface devices, datacenter servers, and other hardware are assembled in Asia and other geographies that may be subject to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting in shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins. These same risks would apply to any other hardware and software products we may offer. We may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure. Source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, is critical to our business. Although we license portions of our application and operating system source code to several licensees, we take significant measures to protect the secrecy of large portions of our source code. If our source code leaks, we might lose future trade secret protection for that code. It may then become easier for third parties to compete with our products by copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. Unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risks described in the next paragraph. Legal changes, our evolving business model, piracy, and other factors may decrease the value of our intellectual property. Protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property on a global basis is difficult. While piracy adversely affects U.S. revenue, the impact on revenue from outside the U.S. is more significant, particularly countries in which the legal system provides less protection for intellectual property rights. Our revenue in these markets may grow more slowly than the underlying device market. Similarly, the absence of harmonized patent laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent rights. Throughout the world, we educate users about the benefits of licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks, and we educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. Reductions in the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue. We expend significant resources to patent the intellectual property we create with the expectation that we will generate revenues by incorporating that intellectual property in our products or services or, in some instances, by licensing our patents to others in return for a royalty. Changes in the law may continue to weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patents. These include legislative changes and regulatory actions that make it more difficult to obtain injunctions, and the increasing use of legal process to challenge issued patents. Similarly, licensees of our patents may fail to satisfy their obligations to pay us royalties, or may contest the scope and extent of their obligations. The royalties we can obtain to monetize our intellectual property may decline because of the evolution of technology, selling price changes in products using licensed patents, or the difficulty of discovering infringements. Finally, our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause us to license our intellectual property rights broadly in certain situations and may negatively impact revenue. 23 PART I Item 1A Third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. From time to time, others claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. The number of these claims may grow bec ause of constant technological change in the markets in which we compete, the extensive patent coverage of existing technologies, the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, and our offering of first-party devices, such as Microsoft Surface. To resolve thes e claims, we may enter into royalty and licensing agreements on terms that are less favorable than currently available, stop selling or redesign affected products or services, or pay damages to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. These outcomes may cause operating margins to decline. Besides money damages, in some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products or services that have infringing technologies. In s ome countries, such as Germany, an injunction can be issued before the parties have fully litigated the validity of the underlying patents. We have paid significant amounts to settle claims related to the use of technology and intellectual property rights and to procure intellectual property rights as part of our strategy to manage this risk, and may continue to do so. We have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes. We are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. These claims may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives, including major new product releases such as Windows 10, significant business transactions, warranty or product claims, and employment practices. Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. The litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. A material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Government litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rules may limit how we design and market our products. As a leading global software and device maker, government agencies closely scrutinize us under U.S. and foreign competition laws. Governments are actively enforcing competition laws and regulations, and this includes scrutiny in potentially large markets such as the European Union (“EU”), the U.S., and China. Some jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claims of anti-competitive conduct. U.S. federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue to scrutinize our business. The European Commission (“the Commission”) closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume Microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. Flagship product releases such as Windows 10 can receive significant scrutiny under competition laws. For example, in 2004, the Commission ordered us to create new versions of our Windows operating system that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary Windows communications protocols in their own products. In 2009, the Commission accepted a set of commitments we offered to address the Commission’s concerns relating to competition in web browsing software, including an undertaking to address Commission concerns relating to interoperability. The web browsing commitments expired in 2014. The remaining obligations may limit our ability to innovate in Windows or other products in the future, diminish the developer appeal of the Windows platform, and increase our product development costs. The availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our products, which could hamper sales of our products. Our portfolio of first-party devices continues to grow; at the same time our OEM partners offer a large variety of devices for our platforms. As a result, increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our OEM partners, creating a risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rules. Regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase. Certain foreign governments, particularly in China and other countries in Asia, have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for our intellectual property. Government regulatory actions and court decisions such as these may result in fines, or hinder our ability to provide the benefits of our software to consumers and businesses, reducing the attractiveness of our products and the revenue that come from them. New competition law actions could be initiated, potentially using previous actions as precedent. The outcome of such actions, or steps taken to avoid them, could adversely affect us in a variety of ways, including: • We may have to choose between withdrawing products from certain geographies to avoid fines or designing and developing alternative versions of those products to comply with government rulings, which may entail a delay in a product release and removing functionality that customers want or on which developers rely. 24 PART I Item 1A • We may be required to make available licenses to our proprietary technologies on terms that do not reflect their fair market value or do not protect our associated intellectual property. • We are subject to a variety of ongoing commitments because of court or administrative orders, consent decrees, or other voluntary actions we have taken. If we fail to comply with these commitments, we may incur litigation costs and be subject to substantial fines or other remedial actions. • Our ability to realize anticipated Windows 10 post-sale monetization opportunities may be limited. Our global operations subject us to potential liability under anti-corruption, trade protection, and other laws and regulations. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other anti-corruption laws and regulations (“Anti-Corruption Laws”) prohibit corrupt payments by our employees, vendors, or agents, and the accounting provisions of the FCPA require us to maintain accurate books and records and adequate internal controls. From time to time, we receive inquiries from authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere which may be based on reports from employees and others about our business activities outside the U.S. and our compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws. Periodically, we receive such reports directly and investigate them. On July 22, 2019, our Hungarian subsidiary entered into a non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”) with the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and we agreed to the terms of a cease and desist order with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These agreements required us to pay $25.3 million in monetary penalties, disgorgement, and interest pertaining to activities at Microsoft’s subsidiary in Hungary. The NPA, which has a three-year term, also contains certain ongoing compliance requirements, including the obligations to disclose to the DOJ issues that may implicate the FCPA and to cooperate in any inquiries. Most countries in which we operate also have competition laws that prohibit competitors from colluding or otherwise attempting to reduce competition between themselves. While we devote substantial resources to our U.S. and international compliance programs and have implemented policies, training, and internal controls designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payments and collusive activity, our employees, vendors, or agents may violate our policies. Our failure to comply with Anti-Corruption Laws or competition laws could result in significant fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Operations outside the U.S. may be affected by changes in trade protection laws, policies, sanctions, and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment. We may be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we sell goods or services in violation of U.S. trade sanctions on restricted entities or countries such as Iran, North Korea, Cuba, Sudan, and Syria. Other regulatory areas that may apply to our products and online services offerings include user privacy, telecommunications, data storage and protection, and online content. For example, some regulators are taking the position that our offerings such as Skype are covered by existing laws regulating telecommunications services, and some new laws are defining more of our services as regulated telecommunications services. This trend may continue and will result in these offerings being subjected to additional data protection, security, and law enforcement surveillance obligations. Data protection authorities may assert that our collection, use, and management of customer data is inconsistent with their laws and regulations. Legislative or regulatory action relating to cybersecurity requirements may increase the costs to develop, implement, or secure our products and services. Legislative or regulatory action could also emerge in the area of AI and content moderation, increasing costs or restricting opportunity. Applying these laws and regulations to our business is often unclear, subject to change over time, and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Additionally, these laws and governments’ approach to their enforcement, and our products and services, are continuing to evolve. Compliance with these types of regulation may involve significant costs or require changes in products or business practices that result in reduced revenue. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalties or orders we stop the alleged noncompliant activity. We strive to empower all people and organizations to achieve more, and accessibility of our products is an important aspect of this goal. There is increasing pressure from advocacy groups, regulators, competitors, customers, and other stakeholders to make technology more accessible. If our products do not meet customer expectations or emerging global accessibility requirements, we could lose sales opportunities or face regulatory actions 25 PART I Item 1A Laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our services or result in increased costs, legal claims, fines against us , or reputational damage . The growth of our Internet- and cloud-based services internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundaries. Legal requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, and transfer of personal data continue to evolve . For example, the EU and the U.S. formally entered into a new framework in July 2016 that provides a mechanism for companies to transfer data from EU member states to the U.S. This framework, called the Privacy Shield, is intended to address shortcomings identified by the European Court of Justice in a predecessor mechanism. The Privacy Shield and other mechanisms are currently subject to challenges in European courts, which may lead to uncertainty about the legal basis for data transfers across the Atlant ic. The Privacy Shield and other potential rules on the flow of data across borders could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our products and services in some markets. In May 2018, a new EU law governing data practices and privacy , the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), bec a me effective. The law , which applies to all of our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or related to products and services offered in the EU, imposes a range of new compliance obligations regarding the handling of personal data. Engineering efforts to build new capabilities to facilitate compliance with the law have entailed substantial expense and the diversion of engineering resources from other projects and may continue to do so. We might experien ce reduced demand for our offerings if we are unable to engineer products that meet our legal duties or help our customers meet their obligations under the GDPR or other data regulations, or if the changes we implement to comply with the GDPR make our offe rings less attractive. The GDPR imposes significant new obligations and compliance with these obligations depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them. If we fail to comply with the GDPR, or if regulators assert we have failed to c omply with the GDPR, it may lead to regulatory enforcement actions, which can result in monetary penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue, private lawsuits , or reputational damage . In the U.S., California has adopted and several states are considering ad opting laws and regulations imposing obligations regarding the handling of personal data. The Company’s investment in gaining insights from data is becoming central to the value of the services we deliver to customers, to our operational efficiency and key opportunities in monetization, customer perceptions of quality, and operational efficiency. Our ability to use data in this way may be constrained by regulatory developments that impede realizing the expected return from this investment. Ongoing legal reviews by regulators may result in burdensome or inconsistent requirements, including data sovereignty and localization requirements, affecting the location and movement of our customer and internal employee data as well as the management of that data. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding personal data may require changes in services, business practices, or internal systems that result in increased costs, lower revenue, reduced efficiency, or greater difficulty in competing with foreign-based firms. Compliance with data regulations might limit our ability to innovate or offer certain features and functionality in some jurisdictions where we operate. Failure to comply with existing or new rules may result in significant penalties or orders to stop the alleged noncompliant activity, as well as negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort. We may have additional tax liabilities. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, compliance with the 2017 United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the Company, the use of estimates in our consolidated financial statements, and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions. As regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the TCJA, and as we gather more information and perform more analysis, our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements. We regularly are under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. Although we believe that our provision for income taxes and our tax estimates are reasonable, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken. In addition, economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue in various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. We are currently under Internal Revenue Service audit for prior tax years, with the primary unresolved issues relating to transfer pricing. The final resolution of those audits, and other audits or litigation, may differ from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements in the period or periods in which that determination is made. 26 PART I Item 1A We earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the U.S . A change in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our business or structure, or the expiration of or disputes about certain tax agreements in a particular country may result in higher effective tax rates for the Company. In addition, changes in U.S. federal and state or international tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries, including in the U.S., and changes in taxing juris dictions’ administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions may materially adversely impact our consolidated financial statements . If our reputation or our brands are damaged, our business and operating results may be harmed . Our reputation and brands are globally recognized and are important to our business. Our reputation and brands affect our ability to attract and retain consumer, business, and public-sector customers. There are numerous ways our reputation or brands could be damaged. These include product safety or quality issues, or our environmental impact and sustainability, supply chain practices, or human rights record. We may experience backlash from customers, government entities, advocacy groups, employees, and other stakeholders that disagree with our product offering decisions or public policy positions. Damage to our reputation or our brands may occur from, among other things: • The introduction of new features, products, services, or terms of service that customers, users, or partners do not like. • Public scrutiny of our decisions regarding user privacy, data practices, or content. • Data security breaches, compliance failures, or actions of partners or individual employees. The proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood, speed, and magnitude of negative brand events. If our brands or reputation are damaged, it could negatively impact our revenues or margins, or ability to attract the most highly qualified employees. Our global business exposes us to operational and economic risks. Our customers are located throughout the world and a significant part of our revenue comes from international sales. The global nature of our business creates operational and economic risks. Our results of operations may be affected by global, regional, and local economic developments, monetary policy, inflation, and recession, as well as political and military disputes. In addition, our international growth strategy includes certain markets, the developing nature of which presents several risks, including deterioration of social, political, labor, or economic conditions in a country or region, and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations. Emerging nationalist trends in specific countries may significantly alter the trade environment. Changes to trade policy or agreements as a result of populism, protectionism, or economic nationalism may result in higher tariffs, local sourcing initiatives, or other developments that make it more difficult to sell our products in foreign countries. Disruptions of these kinds in developed or emerging markets could negatively impact demand for our products and services or increase operating costs. Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our results of operations . Adverse economic or market conditions may harm our business. Worsening economic conditions, including inflation, recession, or other changes in economic conditions, may cause lower IT spending and adversely affect our revenue. If demand for PCs, servers, and other computing devices declines, or consumer or business spending for those products declines, our revenue will be adversely affected. Substantial revenue comes from our U.S. government contracts. An extended federal government shutdown resulting from failing to pass budget appropriations, adopt continuing funding resolutions or raise the debt ceiling, and other budgetary decisions limiting or delaying federal government spending, could reduce government IT spending on our products and services and adversely affect our revenue. Our product distribution system relies on an extensive partner and retail network. OEMs building devices that run our software have also been a significant means of distribution. The impact of economic conditions on our partners, such as the bankruptcy of a major distributor, OEM, or retailer, could cause sales channel disruption. Challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. As a result, allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase. 27 PART I Item 1A We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, t ypes, and maturities. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that affect global financial markets. A significant part of our investment portfolio c omprises U.S. government securities. If global financial markets decline for long periods, or if there is a downgrade of the U.S. government credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt, our investment portfolio may be adversely affected and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements . Catastrophic events or geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business. A disruption or failure of our systems or operations because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyberattack, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other critical functions. Our corporate headquarters, a significant portion of our research and development activities, and certain other essential business operations are in the Seattle, Washington area, and we have other business operations in the Silicon Valley area of California, both of which are seismically active regions. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or IT systems, or the infrastructure or systems they rely on, such as power grids, could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations. Providing our customers with more services and solutions in the cloud puts a premium on the resilience of our systems and strength of our business continuity management plans, and magnifies the potential impact of prolonged service outages on our consolidated financial statements. Abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict pose a risk of general economic disruption in affected countries, which may increase our operating costs. These conditions also may add uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers, and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers. Geopolitical change may result in changing regulatory requirements that could impact our operating strategies, access to global markets, hiring, and profitability. Geopolitical instability may lead to sanctions and impact our ability to do business in some markets or with some public-sector customers. Any of these changes may negatively impact our revenues. The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy or the IT industry in particular are unclear. Environmental regulations or changes in the supply, demand or available sources of energy or other natural resources may affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our business. Changes in weather where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling computer hardware we use to develop software and provide cloud-based services. Our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees. Our business is based on successfully attracting and retaining talented employees representing diverse backgrounds, experiences, and skill sets. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. Maintaining our brand and reputation, as well as a diverse and inclusive work environment that enables all our employees to thrive, are important to our ability to recruit and retain employees. We are also limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. Changes to U.S. immigration policies that restrain the flow of technical and professional talent may inhibit our ability to adequately staff our research and development efforts. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. How employment-related laws are interpreted and applied to our workforce practices may result in increased operating costs and less flexibility in how we meet our workforce needs. 28 PART I Item 1B, 2, 3, 4 ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVE D STAFF COMMENTS We have received no written comments regarding our periodic or current reports from the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of our fiscal year 2019 that remain unresolved. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES Our corporate headquarters are located in Redmond, Washington. We have approximately 15 million square feet of space located in King County, Washington that is used for engineering, sales, marketing, and operations, among other general and administrative purposes. These facilities include approximately 10 million square feet of owned space situated on approximately 520 acres of land we own at our corporate headquarters, and approximately five million square feet of space we lease. In addition, we own and lease space domestically that includes office, datacenter, and retail space. We also own and lease facilities internationally. The largest owned properties include: our research and development centers in China and India; our datacenters in Ireland, the Netherlands, and Singapore; and our operations and facilities in Ireland and the United Kingdom. The largest leased properties include space in the following locations: Australia, Canada, China, Germany, India, Japan, and the United Kingdom.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Microsoft Corporation. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). OVERVIEW Microsoft is a technology company whose mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. We strive to create local opportunity, growth, and impact in every country around the world. Our platforms and tools help drive small business productivity, large business competitiveness, and public-sector efficiency. They also support new startups, improve educational and health outcomes, and empower human ingenuity. We generate revenue by offering a wide range of cloud-based and other services to people and businesses; licensing and supporting an array of software products; designing, manufacturing, and selling devices; and delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience. Our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees; designing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling our products and services; datacenter costs in support of our cloud-based services; and income taxes. Highlights from fiscal year 2019 compared with fiscal year 2018 included: • Commercial cloud revenue, which includes Microsoft Office 365 Commercial, Microsoft Azure, the commercial portion of LinkedIn, Microsoft Dynamics 365, and other commercial cloud properties, increased 43% to $38.1 billion. • Office Commercial revenue increased 13%, driven by Office 365 Commercial growth of 33%. • Office Consumer revenue increased 7%, and Office 365 Consumer subscribers increased to 34.8 million. • LinkedIn revenue increased 28%, with record levels of engagement highlighted by LinkedIn sessions growth of 27%. • Dynamics revenue increased 15%, driven by Dynamics 365 growth of 47%. • Server products and cloud services revenue, including GitHub, increased 25%, driven by Azure growth of 72%. • Enterprise Services revenue increased 5%. • Windows original equipment manufacturer licensing (“Windows OEM”) revenue increased 4%. • Windows Commercial revenue increased 14%. • Microsoft Surface revenue increased 23%. • Gaming revenue increased 10%, driven by Xbox software and services growth of 19%. • Search advertising revenue, excluding traffic acquisition costs, increased 13%. We have recast certain prior period commercial cloud metrics to include the commercial portion of LinkedIn to provide a comparable view of our commercial cloud business performance. The commercial portion of LinkedIn includes LinkedIn Recruiter, Sales Navigator, premium business subscriptions, and other services for organizations. On October 25, 2018, we acquired GitHub, Inc. (“GitHub”) in a $7.5 billion stock transaction (inclusive of total cash payments of $1.3 billion in respect of vested GitHub equity awards and an indemnity escrow). The financial results of GitHub have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition. GitHub is reported as part of our Intelligent Cloud segment. Refer to Note 8 – Business Combinations of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. 32 PART II Item 7 On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) was enacted into law, which significantly changed existing U.S. tax law and included numerous provisions that affect our business. We recorded a provisional ne t charge related to the enactment of the TCJA of $13. 7 billion in fiscal year 2018 , and adjusted our provisional net charge by recording additional tax expense of $ 157 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2019. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, in response to the TCJA and recently issued regulations, we transferred certain intangible properties held by our foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. and Ireland, which resulted in a $2.6 billion net income tax benef it . Refer to Note 12 – Income Taxes of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. Industry Trends Our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business. At Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces. Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks The markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud, and in some cases, the user’s choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. The investments we are making in infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins. Our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one’s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive compensation and benefits. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. Our international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. Strengthening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar throughout fiscal year 2018 positively impacted reported revenue and increased reported expenses from our international operations. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies did not significantly impact reported revenue or expenses from our international operations in the first and second quarters of fiscal year 2019, and reduced reported revenue and expenses from our international operations in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2019. Refer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) for a discussion of these factors and other risks. Seasonality Our revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Second quarter revenue is driven by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period. Reportable Segments We report our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing. The segment amounts included in MD&A are presented on a basis consistent with our internal management reporting. All differences between our internal management reporting basis and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), along with certain corporate-level and other activity, are included in Corporate and Other. Additional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 20 – Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). 33 PART II Item 7 SUMMARY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (In millions, except percentages and per share amounts) 2019 2018 2017 Percentage Change 2019 Versus 2018 Percentage Change 2018 Versus 2017 Revenue $ 125,843 $ 110,360 $ 96,571 14% 14% Gross margin 82,933 72,007 62,310 15% 16% Operating income 42,959 35,058 29,025 23% 21% Net income 39,240 16,571 25,489 137% (35)% Diluted earnings per share 5.06 2.13 3.25 138% (34)% Non-GAAP operating income 42,959 35,058 29,331 23% 20% Non-GAAP net income 36,830 30,267 25,732 22% 18% Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share 4.75 3.88 3.29 22% 18% Non-GAAP operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) exclude the net tax impact of transfer of intangible properties, the net tax impact of the TCJA, and restructuring expenses. Refer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section below for a reconciliation of our financial results reported in accordance with GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. Fiscal Year 2019 Compared with Fiscal Year 2018 Revenue increased $15.5 billion or 14%, driven by growth across each of our segments. Intelligent Cloud revenue increased, driven by server products and cloud services. Productivity and Business Processes revenue increased, driven by Office and LinkedIn. More Personal Computing revenue increased, driven by Surface, Gaming, and Windows. Gross margin increased $10.9 billion or 15%, driven by growth across each of our segments. Gross margin percentage increased slightly, due to gross margin percentage improvement across each of our segments and favorable segment sales mix. Gross margin included a 5 percentage point improvement in commercial cloud, primarily from Azure. Operating income increased $7.9 billion or 23%, driven by growth across each of our segments. Key changes in expenses were: • Cost of revenue increased $4.6 billion or 12%, driven by growth in commercial cloud, Surface, and Gaming. • Research and development expenses increased $2.2 billion or 15%, driven by investments in cloud and artificial intelligence (“AI”) engineering, Gaming, LinkedIn, and GitHub. • Sales and marketing expenses increased $744 million or 4%, driven by investments in commercial sales capacity, LinkedIn, and GitHub, offset in part by a decrease in marketing. Sales and marketing expenses included a favorable foreign currency impact of 2%. Current year net income included a $2.6 billion net income tax benefit related to intangible property transfers and a $157 million net charge related to the enactment of the TCJA, which together resulted in an increase to net income and diluted EPS of $2.4 billion and $0.31, respectively. Prior year net income and diluted EPS were negatively impacted by the net charge related to the enactment of the TCJA, which resulted in a decrease to net income and diluted EPS of $13.7 billion and $1.75, respectively. Fiscal Year 2018 Compared with Fiscal Year 2017 Revenue increased $13.8 billion or 14%, driven by growth across each of our segments.

Gains and losses from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net. Fiscal Year 2019 Compared with Fiscal Year 2018 Interest and dividends income increased primarily due to higher yields on fixed-income securities. Interest expense decreased primarily driven by a decrease in outstanding long-term debt due to debt maturities, offset in part by higher finance lease expense . Net recognized gains on investments decreased primarily due to lower gains on sales of equity investments. Net gains on derivatives includes gains on foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives in the current period as compared to losses in the prior period . Fiscal Year 2018 Compared with Fiscal Year 2017 Dividends and interest income increased primarily due to higher average portfolio balances and yields on fixed-income securities. Interest expense increased primarily due to higher average outstanding long-term debt and higher finance lease expense. Net recognized gains on investments decreased primarily due to higher losses on sales of fixed-income securities, offset in part by higher gains on sales of equity securities. Net losses on derivatives decreased primarily due to lower losses on equity, foreign exchange, and commodity derivatives, offset in part by losses on interest rate derivatives in the current period as compared to gains in the prior period. INCOME TAXES Effective Tax Rate Fiscal Year 2019 Compared with Fiscal Year 2018 Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2019 and 2018 was 10% and 55%, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the TCJA in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 and a $2.6 billion net income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to intangible property transfers. Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to the tax benefit related to intangible property transfers, and earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico. The mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. In fiscal year 2019, our U.S. income before income taxes was $15.8 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $27.9 billion. In fiscal year 2018, our U.S. income before income taxes was $11.5 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $24.9 billion. 40 PART II Item 7 Fiscal Year 2018 Compared with Fiscal Year 2017 Our effective tax rate for fiscal years 2018 and 2017 was 55% and 15%, respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the TCJA in fiscal year 2018 and the realization of tax benefits attributable to previous Phone business losses in fiscal year 2017. Our effective tax rate was higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the TCJA, offset in part by earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico. The mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the geographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. In fiscal year 2018, our U.S. income before income taxes was $11.5 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $24.9 billion. In fiscal year 2017, our U.S. income before income taxes was $6.8 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $23.1 billion. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was enacted into law, which significantly changed existing U.S. tax law and included numerous provisions that affect our business, such as imposing a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income, reducing the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, and adopting a territorial tax system. In fiscal year 2018, the TCJA required us to incur a transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to U.S. income tax at a rate of 15.5% for foreign cash and certain other net current assets, and 8% on the remaining income. The TCJA reduced the U.S. federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. In addition, the TCJA subjected us to a tax on our global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) effective July 1, 2018. Under GAAP, we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the GILTI inclusion as a current period expense or factor such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes. We elected the deferred method, under which we recorded the corresponding deferred tax assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. During fiscal year 2018, we recorded a net charge of $13.7 billion related to the enactment of the TCJA, due to the impact of the one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income of $17.9 billion, offset in part by the impact of changes in the tax rate of $4.2 billion, primarily on deferred tax assets and liabilities. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, we recorded additional tax expense of $157 million, which related to completing our provisional accounting for GILTI deferred taxes pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, in response to the TCJA and recently issued regulations, we transferred certain intangible properties held by our foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. and Ireland. The transfers of intangible properties resulted in a $2.6 billion net income tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, as the value of future tax deductions exceeded the current tax liability from foreign jurisdictions and U.S. GILTI tax. Refer to Note 12 – Income Taxes of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. 41 PART II Item 7 Uncertain Tax Positions We settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011. In February 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. We also settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in fiscal year 2016, and a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. We remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2013. We expect the IRS to begin an examination of tax years 2014 to 2017 within the next 12 months. As of June 30, 2019, the primary unresolved issues for the IRS audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved. We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2018, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Non-GAAP operating income, net income, and diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures which exclude the net tax impact of transfer of intangible properties, the net tax impact of the TCJA, and restructuring expenses. We believe these non-GAAP measures aid investors by providing additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify trends affecting our business. For comparability of reporting, management considers non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP financial results in evaluating business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures presented should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following table reconciles our financial results reported in accordance with GAAP to non-GAAP financial results: (In millions, except percentages and per share amounts) 2019 2018 2017 Percentage Change 2019 Versus 2018 Percentage Change 2018 Versus 2017 Operating income $ 42,959 $ 35,058 $ 29,025 23% 21% Net tax impact of transfer of intangible properties 0 0 0 * * Net tax impact of the TCJA 0 0 0 * * Restructuring expenses 0 0 306 * * Non-GAAP operating income $ 42,959 $ 35,058 $ 29,331 23% 20% Net income $ 39,240 $ 16,571 $ 25,489 137% (35)% Net tax impact of transfer of intangible properties (2,567 ) 0 0 * * Net tax impact of the TCJA 157 13,696 0 * * Restructuring expenses 0 0 243 * * Non-GAAP net income $ 36,830 $ 30,267 $ 25,732 22% 18% Diluted earnings per share $ 5.06 $ 2.13 $ 3.25 138% (34)% Net tax impact of transfer of intangible properties (0.33 ) 0 0 * * Net tax impact of the TCJA 0.02 1.75 0 * * Restructuring expenses 0 0 0.04 * * Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share $ 4.75 $ 3.88 $ 3.29 22% 18% * Not meaningful. 42 PART II Item 7 FINANCIAL CONDITION Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $133.8 billion as of both June 30, 2019 and 2018. Equity investments were $2.6 billion and $1.9 billion as of June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our short-term investments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S. dollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities to diversify risk. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities. Valuation In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments, such as commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Level 3 investments are valued using internally-developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio. A majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments. Broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments. In addition, all our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate. Cash Flows Fiscal Year 2019 Compared with Fiscal Year 2018 Cash from operations increased $8.3 billion to $52.2 billion for fiscal year 2019, mainly due to an increase in cash received from customers, offset in part by an increase in cash paid to suppliers and employees and an increase in cash paid for income taxes. Cash used in financing increased $3.3 billion to $36.9 billion for fiscal year 2019, mainly due to an $8.8 billion increase in common stock repurchases and a $1.1 billion increase in dividends paid, offset in part by a $6.2 billion decrease in repayments of debt, net of proceeds from issuance of debt. Cash used in investing increased $9.7 billion to $15.8 billion for fiscal year 2019, mainly due to a $6.0 billion decrease in cash from net investment purchases, sales, and maturities, a $2.3 billion increase in additions to property and equipment, and a $1.5 billion increase in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets. 43 PART II Item 7 Fiscal Year 2018 Compared with Fiscal Year 2017 Cash from operations increased $4.4 billion to $43.9 billion for fiscal year 2018, mainly due to an increase in cash received from customers, offset in part by an increase in cash paid to employees, net cash paid for income taxes, cash paid for interest on debt, and cash paid to suppliers. Cash used in financing was $33.6 billion for fiscal year 2018, compared to cash from financing of $8.4 billion for fiscal year 2017. The change was mainly due to a $41.7 billion decrease in proceeds from issuance of debt, net of repayments of debt, offset in part by a $1.1 billion decrease in cash used for common stock repurchases. Cash used in investing decreased $40.7 billion to $6.1 billion for fiscal year 2018, mainly due to a $25.1 billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets, and a $19.1 billion increase in cash from net investment purchases, sales, and maturities. Debt We issue debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment. The proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing debt. Refer to Note 11 – Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. Unearned Revenue Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include Software Assurance (“SA”) and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service. Refer to Note 1 – Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. The following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of June 30, 2019: (In millions) Three Months Ending, September 30, 2019 $ 12,353 December 31, 2019 9,807 March 31, 2020 6,887 June 30, 2020 3,629 Thereafter 4,530 Total $ 37,206 If our customers choose to license cloud-based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction-based products and services, the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption, as applicable. Share Repurchases For fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, we repurchased 150 million shares, 99 million shares, and 170 million shares of our common stock for $16.8 billion, $8.6 billion, and $10.3 billion, respectively, through our share repurchase programs. All repurchases were made using cash resources. Refer to Note 17 – Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. Dividends Refer to Note 17 – Stockholders’ Equity of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. 44 PART II Item 7 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. Additionally, we have agreed to cover damages resulting from breaches of certain security and privacy commitments in our cloud business. In evaluating estimated losses on these obligations, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. These obligations did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements during the periods presented. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes the payments due by fiscal year for our outstanding contractual obligations as of June 30, 2019: (In millions) 2020 2021-2022 2023-2024 Thereafter Total Long-term debt: (a) Principal payments $ 5,518 $ 11,744 $ 8,000 $ 47,519 $ 72,781 Interest payments 2,299 4,309 3,818 29,383 39,809 Construction commitments (b) 3,443 515 0 0 3,958 Operating leases, including imputed interest (c) 1,790 3,144 2,413 3,645 10,992 Finance leases, including imputed interest (c) 797 2,008 2,165 9,872 14,842 Transition tax (d) 1,180 2,900 4,168 8,155 16,403 Purchase commitments (e) 17,478 1,185 159 339 19,161 Other long-term liabilities (f) 0 72 29 324 425 Total $ 32,505 $ 25,877 $ 20,752 $ 99,237 $ 178,371 (a) Refer to Note 11 – Debt of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).

(d) Refer to Note 12 – Income Taxes of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). ( e ) Amounts represent purchase commitments, including open purchase orders and take-or-pay contracts that are not presented as construction commitments above. ( f ) We have excluded long-term tax contingencies, other tax liabilities, and deferred income taxes of $14.2 billion from the amounts presented as the timing of these obligations is uncertain. We have also excluded unearned revenue and non-cash items. Other Planned Uses of Capital We will continue to invest in sales, marketing, product support infrastructure, and existing and advanced areas of technology, as well as continue making acquisitions that align with our business strategy. Additions to property and equipment will continue, including new facilities, datacenters, and computer systems for research and development, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff. We expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years to support growth in our cloud offerings. We have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, retail stores, and certain equipment. We have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources. Liquidity As a result of the TCJA, we are required to pay a one-time transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to U.S. income tax. Under the TCJA, the transition tax is payable interest free over eight years, with 8% due in each of the first five years, 15% in year six, 20% in year seven, and 25% in year eight. We have paid transition tax of approximately $2.0 billion, which included $1.5 billion for fiscal year 2019. The first installment of the transition tax was paid in fiscal year 2019, and the remaining transition tax of $16.4 billion is payable over the next seven years with a final payment in fiscal year 2026. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, we expect to pay $1.2 billion related to the second installment of the transition tax, and $3.5 billion related to the transfer of intangible properties in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019. 45 PART II Item 7 We expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital markets to continue to be s ufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as dividends, share repurchases, debt maturities, material capital expenditures, and the transition tax related to the TCJA, for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE Refer to Note 1 – Accounting Policies of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparing consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management’s application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, and inventories. Revenue Recognition Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided. Judgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price (“SSP"") for each distinct performance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP. Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers. Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented. 46 PART II Item 7 Impairment of Investment Securities We review debt investments quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost. We also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment indicates that the investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. We perform a qualitative assessment on a quarterly basis. We are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine the amount of the impairment loss. Once an investment is determined to be impaired, an impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net. Goodwill We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. The estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. Research and Development Costs Costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established. We have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to production. The amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products. Legal and Other Contingencies The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. 47 PART II Item 7 Income Taxes The objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. The TCJA significantly changes existing U.S. tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our business. Refer to Note 12 – Income Taxes of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) for further discussion. Inventories Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. These reviews include analysis of demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. 48 PART II Item 7 STATEMENT OF MANAGEMENT’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report. The consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management’s estimates and judgments, have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing consolidated financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets. These systems are augmented by written policies, an organizational structure providing division of responsibilities, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a program of internal audits. The Company engaged Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit and render an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). The Board of Directors, through its Audit Committee, consisting solely of independent directors of the Company, meets periodically with management, internal auditors, and our independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that each is meeting its responsibilities and to discuss matters concerning internal controls and financial reporting. Deloitte & Touche LLP and the internal auditors each have full and free access to the Audit Committee. Satya Nadella Chief Executive Officer Amy E. Hood Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Frank H. Brod Corporate Vice President, Finance and Administration; Chief Accounting Officer 49 PART II Item 7A ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK RISKS We are exposed to economic risk from foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk, and equity prices. We use derivatives instruments to manage these risks, however, they may still impact our consolidated financial statements. Foreign Currency Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar. Interest Rate Securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We manage the average maturity of the fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global fixed-income indices. Credit Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Equity Securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to price risk.

We have recast certain prior period amounts related to investments, derivatives, and fair value measurements to conform to the current period presentation based on our adoption of the new accounting standard for financial instruments. We have recast prior period commercial cloud revenue to include the commercial portion of LinkedIn to provide a comparable view of our commercial cloud business performance. The commercial portion of LinkedIn includes LinkedIn Recruiter, Sales Navigator, premium business subscriptions, and other services for organizations. We have also recast components of the prior period deferred income tax assets and liabilities to conform to the current period presentation. The recast of these prior period amounts had no impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income statements, or net cash from or used in operating, financing, or investing on our consolidated cash flows statements. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Estimates and Assumptions Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations, and determining the standalone selling price (“SSP”) of performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and demand for, our inventory; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; when technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of uncertain tax positions that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments for investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates and assumptions. Foreign Currencies Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income (“OCI”). Revenue Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue Product revenue includes sales from operating systems; cross-device productivity applications; server applications; business solution applications; desktop and server management tools; software development tools; video games; and hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories. Service and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content such as Microsoft Office 365, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Dynamics 365, and Xbox Live; solution support; and consulting services. Service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising and LinkedIn. 56 PART II Item 8 Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. Nature of Products and Services Licenses for on-premises software provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available to the customer. Customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide customers with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Revenue from distinct on-premises licenses is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. In cases where we allocate revenue to software updates, primarily because the updates are provided at no additional charge, revenue is recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the estimated life of the related device or license. Certain volume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements, include on-premises licenses combined with Software Assurance (“SA”). SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and provides support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use products more efficiently. On-premises licenses are considered distinct performance obligations when sold with SA. Revenue allocated to SA is generally recognized ratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits, given that SA comprises distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time. Cloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software, are provided on either a subscription or consumption basis. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis, such as the amount of storage used in a period, is recognized based on the customer utilization of such resources. When cloud services require a significant level of integration and interdependency with software and the individual components are not considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud services are provided. Revenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. Revenue from consulting services is recognized as services are provided. Our hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot function without the operating system. In these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to resellers or directly to end customers through retail stores and online marketplaces. Refer to Note 20 – Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information, including revenue by significant product and service offering. Significant Judgments Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided. 57 PART II Item 8 Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct pe rformance obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell ea ch of the products and services separately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP. Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers. Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented. Contract Balances Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. We record a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. For multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. We record a receivable related to revenue recognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we have an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those licenses. As of June 30, 2019 and 2018, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $2.2 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2019 2018 2017 Balance, beginning of period $ 397 $ 361 $ 409 Charged to costs and other 153 134 58 Write-offs (116 ) (98 ) (106 ) Balance, end of period $ 434 $ 397 $ 361 Allowance for doubtful accounts included in our consolidated balance sheets: (In millions) June 30, 2019 2018 2017 Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts $ 411 $ 377 $ 345 Other long-term assets 23 20 16 Total $ 434 $ 397 $ 361 58 PART II Item 8 Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include SA and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and recogni zed ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the future; LinkedIn subscriptions; Office 365 subscriptions; Xbox Live subscriptions; Windows 10 post-delivery support; Dynamics busin ess solutions; Skype prepaid credits and subscriptions; and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service. Refer to Note 14 – Unearned Revenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes in unearned revenue during the period. Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers with financing. Examples include invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year on-premises licenses that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront. Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer We recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be capitalized. Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were immaterial during the periods presented and are included in other current and long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets. We apply a practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs include our internal sales force compensation program and certain partner sales incentive programs as we have determined annual compensation is commensurate with annual sales activities. Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs related to product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on PCs sold by original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”), to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online advertising space; costs incurred to support and maintain online products and services, including datacenter costs and royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and the amortization of capitalized software development costs. Capitalized software development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the products. Product Warranty We provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the software. We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary. 59 PART II Item 8 Research and Development Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Such costs related to software development are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally shortly before the products are released to production. Once technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $1.6 billion, $1.6 billion, and $1.5 billion in fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Stock-Based Compensation Compensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance stock units (“PSUs”), is measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the related service or performance period. The fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. We measure the fair value of PSUs using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Compensation cost for RSUs is recognized using the straight-line method and for PSUs is recognized using the accelerated method. Compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase. Income Taxes Income tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. Certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. All deferred income taxes are classified as long-term in our consolidated balance sheets. Financial Instruments Investments We consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. 60 PART II Item 8 Debt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in fair value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are recorded in OCI. Debt investments are impaired whe n a decline in fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. We employ a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers avai lable quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost. We also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery. In addition, we consider specifi c adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are measured using the equity method, or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments (referred to as the measurement alternative). We perform a qualitative assessment on a quarterly basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. Changes in value are recorded in other income (expense), net. We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns. These transactions are accounted for as secured borrowings and the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our consolidated balance sheets. Cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability. Derivatives Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), net with offsetting gains and losses on the hedged items. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains and losses are initially reported as a component of OCI and subsequently recognized in revenue when the hedged exposure is recognized in revenue. Gains and losses on derivatives representing either hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness or hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net. For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net. Fair Value Measurements We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are: • Level 1 – inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Our Level 1 investments include U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges. 61 PART II Item 8 • Level 2 – inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instr uments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be corrobo rated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interes t rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies. Our Level 2 investments include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed secur ities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities . Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities primarily include certain over-the-counter option and swap contracts. • Level 3 – inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level 3 assets and liabilities include investments in corporate notes and bonds, and goodwill and intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge. Unobservable inputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities. We measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis. The fair values of these investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. Our other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. Inventories Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue. Property and Equipment Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use, three to seven years; computer equipment, two to three years; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements, three to 20 years; and furniture and equipment, one to 10 years. Land is not depreciated. Leases We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 62 PART II Item 8 We have lease agreem ents with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. For certain equipment leases, such as vehicles, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. Additionally, for certain equipment lease s, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU assets and liabilities. Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. Intangible Assets Our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from one to 20 years. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired. Recent Accounting Guidance Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance Income Taxes – Intra-Entity Asset Transfers In October 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued new guidance requiring an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs, rather than when the asset has been sold to an outside party. We adopted the guidance effective July 1, 2018. Adoption of the guidance was applied using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date. We recorded a net cumulative-effect adjustment that resulted in an increase in retained earnings of $557 million, which reversed the previous deferral of income tax consequences and recorded new deferred tax assets from intra-entity transfers involving assets other than inventory, partially offset by a U.S. deferred tax liability related to global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”). Adoption of the standard resulted in an increase in long-term deferred tax assets of $2.8 billion, an increase in long-term deferred tax liabilities of $2.1 billion, and a reduction in other current assets of $152 million. Adoption of the standard had no impact on cash from or used in operating, financing, or investing on our consolidated cash flows statements. Financial Instruments – Recognition, Measurement, Presentation, and Disclosure In January 2016, the FASB issued a new standard related to certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. Most prominent among the changes in the standard is the requirement for changes in the fair value of our equity investments, with certain exceptions, to be recognized through net income rather than OCI. We adopted the standard effective July 1, 2018. Adoption of the standard was applied using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment from accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) to retained earnings as of the effective date, and we elected to measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments. The cumulative-effect adjustment included any previously held unrealized gains and losses held in AOCI related to our equity investments carried at fair value as well as the impact of recording the fair value of certain equity investments carried at cost. The impact on our consolidated balance sheets upon adoption was not material. Adoption of the standard had no impact on cash from or used in operating, financing, or investing on our consolidated cash flows statements. 63 PART II Item 8 Recent Accounting Guid ance Not Yet Adopted Financial Instruments – Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities In August 2017, the FASB issued new guidance related to accounting for hedging activities. This guidance expands strategies that qualify for hedge accounting, changes how many hedging relationships are presented in the financial statements, and simplifies the application of hedge accounting in certain situations. The standard will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted for any interim or annual period before the effective date. Adoption of the standard will be applied using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date. We evaluated the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements, including accounting policies, processes, and systems, and do not expect the impact to be material upon adoption. Financial Instruments – Credit Losses In June 2016, the FASB issued a new standard to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology under current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. We will be required to use a forward-looking expected credit loss model for accounts receivables, loans, and other financial instruments. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities will also be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of the securities. The standard will be adopted upon the effective date for us beginning July 1, 2020. Adoption of the standard will be applied using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date to align our credit loss methodology with the new standard. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements, including accounting policies, processes, and systems. NOTE 2 — EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards. The components of basic and diluted EPS were as follows: (In millions, except earnings per share) Year Ended June 30, 2019 2018 2017 Net income available for common shareholders (A) $ 39,240 $ 16,571 $ 25,489 Weighted average outstanding shares of common stock (B) 7,673 7,700 7,746 Dilutive effect of stock-based awards 80 94 86 Common stock and common stock equivalents (C) 7,753 7,794 7,832 Earnings Per Share Basic (A/B) $ 5.11 $ 2.15 $ 3.29 Diluted (A/C) $ 5.06 $ 2.13 $ 3.25 Anti-dilutive stock-based awards excluded from the calculations of diluted EPS were immaterial during the periods presented. 64 PART II Item 8 NOTE 3 — OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET The components of other income (expense), net were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2019 2018 2017 Interest and dividends income $ 2,762 $ 2,214 $ 1,387 Interest expense (2,686 ) (2,733 ) (2,222 ) Net recognized gains on investments 648 2,399 2,583 Net gains (losses) on derivatives 144 (187 ) (510 ) Net losses on foreign currency remeasurements (82 ) (218 ) (111 ) Other, net (57 ) (59 ) (251 ) Total $ 729 $ 1,416 $ 876 Net Recognized Gains (Losses) on Investments Net recognized gains (losses) on debt investments were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2019 2018 2017 Realized gains from sales of available-for-sale securities $ 12 $ 27 $ 108 Realized losses from sales of available-for-sale securities (93 ) (987 ) (162 ) Other-than-temporary impairments of investments (16 ) (6 ) (14 ) Total $ (97 ) $ (966 ) $ (68 ) Net recognized gains (losses) on equity investments were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2019 2018 2017 Net realized gains on investments sold $ 276 $ 3,406 $ 2,692 Net unrealized gains on investments still held 479 0 0 Impairments of investments (10 ) (41 ) (41 ) Total $ 745 $ 3,365 $ 2,651 65 PART II Item 8 NOTE 4 — INVESTMENTS Investment Components The components of investments were as follows: (In millions) Fair Value Level Cost Basis Unrealized Gains Unrealized Losses Recorded Basis Cash and Cash Equivalents Short-term Investments Equity Investments June 30, 2019 Changes in Fair Value Recorded in Other Comprehensive Income Commercial paper Level 2 $ 2,211 $ 0 $ 0 $ 2,211 $ 1,773 $ 438 $ 0 Certificates of deposit Level 2 2,018 0 0 2,018 1,430 588 0 U.S. government securities Level 1 104,925 1,854 (104 ) 106,675 769 105,906 0 U.S. agency securities Level 2 988 0 0 988 698 290 0 Foreign government bonds Level 2 6,350 4 (8 ) 6,346 2,506 3,840 0 Mortgage- and asset-backed securities Level 2 3,554 10 (3 ) 3,561 0 3,561 0 Corporate notes and bonds Level 2 7,437 111 (7 ) 7,541 0 7,541 0 Corporate notes and bonds Level 3 15 0 0 15 0 15 0 Municipal securities Level 2 242 48 0 290 0 290 0 Municipal securities Level 3 7 0 0 7 0 7 0 Total debt investments $ 127,747 $ 2,027 $ (122 ) $ 129,652 $ 7,176 $ 122,476 $ 0 Changes in Fair Value Recorded in Net Income Equity investments Level 1 $ 973 $ 409 $ 0 $ 564 Equity investments Other 2,085 0 0 2,085 Total equity investments $ 3,058 $ 409 $ 0 $ 2,649 Cash $ 3,771 $ 3,771 $ 0 $ 0 Derivatives, net (a) (13 ) 0 (13 ) 0 Total $ 136,468 $ 11,356 $ 122,463 $ 2,649 66 PART II Item 8 (In millions) Fair Value Level Cost Basis Unrealized Gains Unrealized Losses Recorded Basis Cash and Cash Equivalents Short-term Investments Equity Investments June 30, 2018 Changes in Fair Value Recorded in Other Comprehensive Income Commercial paper Level 2 $ 2,513 $ 0 $ 0 $ 2,513 $ 2,215 $ 298 $ 0 Certificates of deposit Level 2 2,058 0 0 2,058 1,865 193 0 U.S. government securities Level 1 108,120 62 (1,167 ) 107,015 2,280 104,735 0 U.S. agency securities Level 2 1,742 0 0 1,742 1,398 344 0 Foreign government bonds Level 1 22 0 0 22 0 22 0 Foreign government bonds Level 2 5,063 1 (10 ) 5,054 0 5,054 0 Mortgage- and asset-backed securities Level 2 3,864 4 (13 ) 3,855 0 3,855 0 Corporate notes and bonds Level 2 6,929 21 (56 ) 6,894 0 6,894 0 Corporate notes and bonds Level 3 15 0 0 15 0 15 0 Municipal securities Level 2 271 37 (1 ) 307 0 307 0 Total debt investments $ 130,597 $ 125 $ (1,247 ) $ 129,475 $ 7,758 $ 121,717 $ 0 Equity investments Level 1 $ 533 $ 246 $ 0 $ 287 Equity investments Level 3 18 0 0 18 Equity investments Other 1,558 0 1 1,557 Total equity investments $ 2,109 $ 246 $ 1 $ 1,862 Cash $ 3,942 $ 3,942 $ 0 $ 0 Derivatives, net (a) 104 0 104 0 Total $ 135,630 $ 11,946 $ 121,822 $ 1,862 (a) Refer to Note 5 – Derivatives for further information on the fair value of our derivative instruments. Equity investments presented as “Other” in the tables above include investments without readily determinable fair values measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments, and investments measured at fair value using net asset value as a practical expedient which are not categorized in the fair value hierarchy. As of June 30, 2019 and 2018, equity investments without readily determinable fair values measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments were $1.2 billion and $697 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2019, we had no collateral received under agreements for loaned securities. As of June 30, 2018, collateral received under agreements for loaned securities was $1.8 billion and primarily comprised U.S. government and agency securities.

Our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as possible. Our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Foreign Currency Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. Option and forward contracts are used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue and are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar. Foreign currency risks related to certain non-U.S. dollar denominated securities are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated as fair value hedging instruments. Certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in foreign exchange rates on certain balance sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures. Equity Securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to market price risk. Market price risk is managed relative to broad-based global and domestic equity indices using certain convertible preferred investments, options, futures, and swap contracts not designated as hedging instruments. In the past, to hedge our price risk, we also used and designated equity derivatives as hedging instruments, including puts, calls, swaps, and forwards. 68 PART II Item 8 Other Interest Rate Securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We manage the average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using exchange-traded option and futures contracts, and over-the-counter swap and option contracts, none of which are designated as hedging instruments. In addition, we use “To Be Announced” forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency mortgage-backed securities. These meet the definition of a derivative instrument in cases where physical delivery of the assets is not taken at the earliest available delivery date. Credit Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade securities. We use credit default swap contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to manage credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. We use credit default swaps as they are a low-cost method of managing exposure to individual credit risks or groups of credit risks. Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features Certain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum liquidity of $1.0 billion. To the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to post collateral, similar to the standard convention related to over-the-counter derivatives. As of June 30, 2019, our long-term unsecured debt rating was AAA, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. As a result, no collateral was required to be posted. The following table presents the notional amounts of our outstanding derivative instruments measured in U.S. dollar equivalents: (In millions) June 30, 2019 June 30, 2018 Designated as Hedging Instruments Foreign exchange contracts sold $ 6,034 $ 11,101 Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Foreign exchange contracts purchased 14,889 9,425 Foreign exchange contracts sold 15,614 13,374 Equity contracts purchased 680 49 Equity contracts sold 5 5 Other contracts purchased 1,327 878 Other contracts sold 451 472 69 PART II Item 8 Fair Values of Derivative Instruments The following table presents our derivative instruments: Derivative Derivative Derivative Derivative (In millions) Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities June 30, 2019 June 30, 2018 Changes in Fair Value Recorded in Other Comprehensive Income Designated as Hedging Instruments Foreign exchange contracts $ 0 $ 0 $ 174 $ 0 Changes in Fair Value Recorded in Net Income Designated as Hedging Instruments Foreign exchange contracts 0 (93 ) 95 0 Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Foreign exchange contracts 204 (172 ) 256 (197 ) Equity contracts 38 0 2 (7 ) Other contracts 8 (7 ) 11 (3 ) Gross amounts of derivatives 250 (272 ) 538 (207 ) Gross amounts of derivatives offset in the balance sheet (113 ) 114 (152 ) 153 Cash collateral received 0 (78 ) 0 (235 ) Net amounts of derivatives $ 137 $ (236 ) $ 386 $ (289 ) Reported as Short-term investments $ (13 ) $ 0 $ 104 $ 0 Other current assets 146 0 260 0 Other long-term assets 4 0 22 0 Other current liabilities 0 (221 ) 0 (288 ) Other long-term liabilities 0 (15 ) 0 (1 ) Total $ 137 $ (236 ) $ 386 $ (289 ) Gross derivative assets and liabilities subject to legally enforceable master netting agreements for which we have elected to offset were $247 million and $272 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2019, and $533 million and $207 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2018.

On October 25, 2018, we acquired GitHub, Inc. (“GitHub”), a software development platform, in a $7.5 billion stock transaction (inclusive of total cash payments of $1.3 billion in respect of vested GitHub equity awards and an indemnity escrow). The acquisition is expected to empower developers to achieve more at every stage of the development lifecycle, accelerate enterprise use of GitHub, and bring Microsoft’s developer tools and services to new audiences. The financial results of GitHub have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition. GitHub is reported as part of our Intelligent Cloud segment. 72 PART II Item 8 The allocation of the purchase price to goodwill was completed as of June 30, 2019.

The measurement periods for the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed end as soon as information on the facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition dates becomes available, but do not exceed 12 months. Adjustments in purchase price allocations may require a change in the amounts allocated to goodwill during the periods in which the adjustments are determined. Any change in the goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency translations and purchase accounting adjustments are presented as “Other” in the table above. Also included in “Other” are business dispositions and transfers between segments due to reorganizations, as applicable. Goodwill Impairment We test goodwill for impairment annually on May 1 at the reporting unit level, primarily using a discounted cash flow methodology with a peer-based, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. We believe use of a discounted cash flow approach is the most reliable indicator of the fair values of the businesses. No instances of impairment were identified in our May 1, 2019, May 1, 2018, or May 1, 2017 tests. As of June 30, 2019 and 2018, accumulated goodwill impairment was $11.3 billion.

In fiscal year 2018, the TCJA required us to incur a transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to U.S. income tax at a rate of 15.5% for foreign cash and certain other net current assets, and 8% on the remaining income. The TCJA reduced the U.S. federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. In addition, the TCJA subjected us to a tax on our GILTI effective July 1, 2018. Under GAAP, we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the GILTI inclusion as a current period expense or factor such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes. We elected the deferred method, under which we recorded the corresponding deferred tax assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. During fiscal year 2018, we recorded a net charge of $13.7 billion related to the enactment of the TCJA, due to the impact of the one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income of $17.9 billion, offset in part by the impact of changes in the tax rate of $4.2 billion, primarily on deferred tax assets and liabilities. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, we recorded additional tax expense of $157 million, which related to completing our provisional accounting for GILTI deferred taxes pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, in response to the TCJA and recently issued regulations, we transferred certain intangible properties held by our foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. and Ireland. The transfers of intangible properties resulted in a $2.6 billion net income tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, as the value of future tax deductions exceeded the current tax liability from foreign jurisdictions and U.S. GILTI tax. 78 PART II Item 8 Provision for Income Taxes The components of the provision for income taxes were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2019 2018 2017 Current Taxes U.S. federal $ 4,718 $ 19,764 $ 2,739 U.S. state and local 662 934 30 Foreign 5,531 4,348 2,472 Current taxes $ 10,911 $ 25,046 $ 5,241 Deferred Taxes U.S. federal $ (5,647 ) $ (4,292 ) $ (554 ) U.S. state and local (1,010 ) (458 ) 269 Foreign 194 (393 ) (544 ) Deferred taxes $ (6,463 ) $ (5,143 ) $ (829 ) Provision for income taxes $ 4,448 $ 19,903 $ 4,412 U.S. and foreign components of income before income taxes were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2019 2018 2017 U.S. $ 15,799 $ 11,527 $ 6,843 Foreign 27,889 24,947 23,058 Income before income taxes $ 43,688 $ 36,474 $ 29,901 Effective Tax Rate The items accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the U.S. federal statutory rate and our effective rate were as follows: Year Ended June 30, 2019 2018 2017 Federal statutory rate 21.0% 28.1% 35.0% Effect of: Foreign earnings taxed at lower rates (4.1)% (7.8)% (11.6)% Impact of the enactment of the TCJA 0.4% 37.7% 0% Phone business losses 0% 0% (5.7)% Impact of intangible property transfers (5.9)% 0% 0% Foreign-derived intangible income deduction (1.4)% 0% 0% Research and development credit (1.1)% (1.3)% (0.9)% Excess tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation (2.2)% (2.5)% (2.1)% Interest, net 1.0% 1.2% 1.4% Other reconciling items, net 2.5% (0.8)% (1.3)% Effective rate 10.2% 54.6% 14.8% 79 PART II Item 8 The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2019 is primarily due to a $2.6 billion net income tax benefit related to intangible property transfers , and earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and dis tributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico . The increase from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2018 is primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the TCJA in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 , offset in part by earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions. The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2017 is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions. Our foreign regional operating centers in Ireland, Singapore and Puerto Rico , which are taxed at rates lower than the U.S. rate, generated 82 %, 8 7 %, and 76 % of our foreign income b efore tax in fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Other reconciling items, net consists primarily of tax credits, GILTI, and U.S. state income taxes. In fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, there were no individually significant other reconciling items. The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 was primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the TCJA in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, and a $2.6 billion net income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to intangible property transfers. The increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the TCJA and the realization of tax benefits attributable to previous Phone business losses in fiscal year 2017. The components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows: (In millions) June 30, 2019 2018 Deferred Income Tax Assets Stock-based compensation expense $ 406 $ 460 Accruals, reserves, and other expenses 2,287 1,832 Loss and credit carryforwards 3,518 3,369 Depreciation and amortization 7,046 351 Leasing liabilities 1,594 1,427 Unearned revenue 475 0 Other 367 56 Deferred income tax assets 15,693 7,495 Less valuation allowance (3,214 ) (3,186 ) Deferred income tax assets, net of valuation allowance $ 12,479 $ 4,309 Deferred Income Tax Liabilities Unrealized gain on investments and debt $ (738 ) $ 0 Unearned revenue (30 ) (639 ) Depreciation and amortization 0 (1,164 ) Leasing assets (1,510 ) (1,366 ) Deferred GILTI tax liabilities (2,607 ) (61 ) Other (291 ) (251 ) Deferred income tax liabilities $ (5,176 ) $ (3,481 ) Net deferred income tax assets (liabilities) $ 7,303 $ 828 Reported As Other long-term assets $ 7,536 $ 1,369 Long-term deferred income tax liabilities (233 ) (541 ) Net deferred income tax assets (liabilities) $ 7,303 $ 828 Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are paid or recovered. 80 PART II Item 8 As of J une 30, 2019, we had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 978 million, $ 770 million, and $11. 6 billion, respectively. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in various years from fiscal 20 20 through 203 9 , if not utilized. The majority of our foreign net operating loss carryforwards do not expire. Certain acquired net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation, but are expected to be realized with the exception of those which have a valuation allowance. The valuation allowance disclosed in the table above relates to the foreign net operating loss carryforwards and other net deferred tax assets that may not be realized. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, were $8.4 billion, $5.5 billion, and $2.4 billion in fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Uncertain Tax Positions Gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions as of June 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017, were $13.1 billion, $12.0 billion, and $11.7 billion, respectively, which were primarily included in long-term income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets. If recognized, the resulting tax benefit would affect our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017 by $12.0 billion, $11.3 billion, and $10.2 billion, respectively. As of June 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017, we had accrued interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $3.4 billion, $3.0 billion, and $2.3 billion, respectively, net of income tax benefits. The provision for (benefit from) income taxes for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017 included interest expense related to uncertain tax positions of $515 million, $688 million, and $399 million, respectively, net of income tax benefits. The aggregate changes in the gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2019 2018 2017 Beginning unrecognized tax benefits $ 11,961 $ 11,737 $ 10,164 Decreases related to settlements (316 ) (193 ) (4 ) Increases for tax positions related to the current year 2,106 1,445 1,277 Increases for tax positions related to prior years 508 151 397 Decreases for tax positions related to prior years (1,113 ) (1,176 ) (49 ) Decreases due to lapsed statutes of limitations 0 (3 ) (48 ) Ending unrecognized tax benefits $ 13,146 $ 11,961 $ 11,737 We settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011. In February 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. We also settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in fiscal year 2016, and a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. We remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2013. We expect the IRS to begin an examination of tax years 2014 to 2017 within the next 12 months. As of June 30, 2019, the primary unresolved issues for the IRS audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved. We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 1996 to 2018, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. NOTE 13 — RESTRUCTURING CHARGES In June 2017, management approved a sales and marketing restructuring plan. In fiscal year 2017, we recorded employee severance expenses of $306 million primarily related to this sales and marketing restructuring plan. The actions associated with this restructuring plan were completed as of June 30, 2018. 81 PART II Item 8 NOTE 14 — UNEARNED REVENUE Unearned revenue by segment was as follows: (In millions) June 30, 2019 2018 Productivity and Business Processes $ 16,831 $ 14,864 Intelligent Cloud 16,988 14,706 More Personal Computing 3,387 3,150 Total $ 37,206 $ 32,720 Changes in unearned revenue were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2019 Balance, beginning of period $ 32,720 Deferral of revenue 69,493 Recognition of unearned revenue (65,007 ) Balance, end of period $ 37,206 Revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized (“contracted not recognized revenue”), which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. Contracted not recognized revenue was $91 billion as of June 30, 2019, of which we expect to recognize approximately 50% of the revenue over the next 12 months and the remainder thereafter. Many customers are committing to our products and services for longer contract terms, which is increasing the percentage of contracted revenue that will be recognized beyond the next 12 months. NOTE 15 — LEASES We have operating and finance leases for datacenters, corporate offices, research and development facilities, retail stores, and certain equipment. Our leases have remaining lease terms of 1 year to 20 years, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to 5 years, and some of which include options to terminate the leases within 1 year. The components of lease expense were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2019 2018 2017 Operating lease cost $ 1,707 $ 1,585 $ 1,412 Finance lease cost: Amortization of right-of-use assets $ 370 $ 243 $ 104 Interest on lease liabilities 247 175 68 Total finance lease cost $ 617 $ 418 $ 172 82 PART II Item 8 Supplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2019 2018 2017 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities: Operating cash flows from operating leases $ 1,670 $ 1,522 $ 1,157 Operating cash flows from finance leases 247 175 68 Financing cash flows from finance leases 221 144 46 Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations: Operating leases 2,303 1,571 1,270 Finance leases 2,532 1,933 1,773 Supplemental balance sheet information related to leases was as follows: (In millions, except lease term and discount rate) June 30, 2019 2018 Operating Leases Operating lease right-of-use assets $ 7,379 $ 6,686 Other current liabilities $ 1,515 $ 1,399 Operating lease liabilities 6,188 5,568 Total operating lease liabilities $ 7,703 $ 6,967 Finance Leases Property and equipment, at cost $ 7,041 $ 4,543 Accumulated depreciation (774 ) (404 ) Property and equipment, net $ 6,267 $ 4,139 Other current liabilities $ 317 $ 176 Other long-term liabilities 6,257 4,125 Total finance lease liabilities $ 6,574 $ 4,301 Weighted Average Remaining Lease Term Operating leases 7 years 7 years Finance leases 13 years 13 years Weighted Average Discount Rate Operating leases 3.0% 2.7% Finance leases 4.6% 5.2% Maturities of lease liabilities were as follows: (In millions) Year Ending June 30, Operating Leases Finance Leases 2020 $ 1,678 $ 591 2021 1,438 616 2022 1,235 626 2023 1,036 631 2024 839 641 Thereafter 2,438 5,671 Total lease payments 8,664 8,776 Less imputed interest (961 ) (2,202 ) Total $ 7,703 $ 6,574 83 PART II Item 8 As of June 30 , 201 9 , we have additional operating and finance leases, primarily for datacenters, that have not yet commenced of $ 2.3 billion and $ 6.1 billion, respectively. These operating and finance leases will commence between fiscal year 20 20 and fiscal year 202 2 with lease terms of 1 year to 15 years. NOTE 16 — CONTINGENCIES Patent and Intellectual Property Claims There were 44 patent infringement cases pending against Microsoft as of June 30, 2019, none of which are material individually or in aggregate. Antitrust, Unfair Competition, and Overcharge Class Actions Antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits were filed against us in British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec, Canada. All three have been certified on behalf of Canadian indirect purchasers who acquired licenses for Microsoft operating system software and/or productivity application software between 1998 and 2010. The trial of the British Columbia action commenced in May 2016. Following a mediation, the parties agreed to a global settlement of all three Canadian actions, and submitted the proposed settlement agreement to the courts in all three jurisdictions for approval. The final settlement has been approved by the courts in British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec, and the claims administration process will commence. Other Antitrust Litigation and Claims China State Administration for Industry and Commerce Investigatio n In 2014, Microsoft was informed that China’s State Agency for Market Regulation (“SAMR”) (formerly State Administration for Industry and Commerce) had begun a formal investigation relating to China’s Anti-Monopoly Law, and the SAMR conducted onsite inspections of Microsoft offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chengdu. The SAMR has presented its preliminary views as to certain possible violations of China's Anti-Monopoly Law, and discussions are expected to continue. Product-Related Litigation U.S. Cell Phone Litigation Microsoft Mobile Oy, a subsidiary of Microsoft, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in 40 lawsuits filed in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and other adverse health effects. We assumed responsibility for these claims in our agreement to acquire Nokia’s Devices and Services business and have been substituted for the Nokia defendants. Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the U.S. Federal Communications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines (“FCC Guidelines”) are pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines. In 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plaintiffs’ expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed scientific methodologies. In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motion to exclude the plaintiffs’ general causation experts. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence. In October 2016, the Court of Appeals issued its decision adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases to the trial court for further proceedings under that standard. The plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which the defendants have moved to strike. In August 2018, the trial court issued an order striking portions of the plaintiffs’ expert reports. A hearing is expected to be scheduled in the second half of calendar year 2019. 84 PART II Item 8 Employment-Related Lit igation Moussouris v. Microsoft Current and former female Microsoft employees in certain engineering and information technology roles brought this class action in federal court in Seattle in 2015, alleging systemic gender discrimination in pay and promotions. The plaintiffs moved to certify the class in October 2017. Microsoft filed an opposition in January 2018, attaching an expert report showing no statistically significant disparity in pay and promotions between similarly situated men and women. In June 2018, the court denied the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. Plaintiffs sought an interlocutory appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which was granted in September 2018. Oral argument is scheduled for October 2019. Other Contingencies We also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although management currently believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may change in the future. As of June 30, 2019, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $386 million. While we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $1.0 billion in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably estimable. NOTE 17 — STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY Shares Outstanding Shares of common stock outstanding were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2019 2018 2017 Balance, beginning of year 7,677 7,708 7,808 Issued 116 68 70 Repurchased (150 ) (99 ) (170 ) Balance, end of year 7,643 7,677 7,708 Share Repurchases On September 16, 2013, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program (“2013 Share Repurchase Program”) authorizing up to $40.0 billion in share repurchases.

As of June 30, 2019, an aggregate of 327 million shares were authorized for future grant under our stock plans. Awards that expire or are canceled without delivery of shares generally become available for issuance under the plans. We issue new shares of Microsoft common stock to satisfy vesting of awards granted under our stock plans. We also have an ESPP for all eligible employees. Stock-based compensation expense and related income tax benefits were as follows: (In millions) Year Ended June 30, 2019 2018 2017 Stock-based compensation expense $ 4,652 $ 3,940 $ 3,266 Income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation 816 823 1,066 87 PART II Item 8 Stock Plans Stock awards entitle the holder to receive shares of Microsoft common stock as the award vests. Stock awards generally vest over a four or five-year service period. Executive Incentive Plan Under the Executive Incentive Plan, the Compensation Committee approves stock awards to executive officers and certain senior executives. RSUs generally vest ratably over a four-year service period. PSUs generally vest over a three-year performance period. The number of shares the PSU holder receives is based on the extent to which the corresponding performance goals have been achieved. Activity for All Stock Plans The fair value of stock awards was estimated on the date of grant using the following assumptions: Year Ended June 30, 2019 2018 2017 Dividends per share (quarterly amounts) $0.42 - $0.46 $0.39 - $0.42 $0.36 - $0.39 Interest rates 1.8% - 3.1% 1.7% - 2.9% 1.2% - 2.2% During fiscal year 2019, the following activity occurred under our stock plans: Shares Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value (In millions) Stock Awards Nonvested balance, beginning of year 174 $ 57.85 Granted (a) 63 107.02 Vested (77 ) 57.08 Forfeited (13 ) 69.35 Nonvested balance, end of year 147 $ 78.49 (a) Includes 2 million, 3 million, and 2 million of PSUs granted at target and performance adjustments above target levels for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. As of June 30, 2019, there was approximately $8.6 billion of total unrecognized compensation costs related to stock awards. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3 years. The weighted average grant-date fair value of stock awards granted was $107.02, $75.88, and $55.64 for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The fair value of stock awards vested was $8.7 billion, $6.6 billion, and $4.8 billion, for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Employee Stock Purchase Plan We have an ESPP for all eligible employees. Shares of our common stock may be purchased by employees at three-month intervals at 90% of the fair market value on the last trading day of each three-month period. Employees may purchase shares having a value not exceeding 15% of their gross compensation during an offering period. Employees purchased the following shares during the periods presented: (Shares in millions) Year Ended June 30, 2019 2018 2017 Shares purchased 11 13 13 Average price per share $ 104.85 $ 76.40 $ 56.36 As of June 30, 2019, 105 million shares of our common stock were reserved for future issuance through the ESPP. 88 PART II Item 8 Savings Plan We have savings plans in the U.S. that qualify under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, and a number of savings plans in international locations. Eligible U.S. employees may contribute a portion of their salary into the savings plans, subject to certain limitations. We contribute fifty cents for each dollar a participant contributes into the plans, with a maximum employer contribution of 50% of the IRS contribution limit for the calendar year. Employer-funded retirement benefits for all plans were $877 million, $807 million, and $734 million in fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, and were expensed as contributed. NOTE 20 — SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA In its operation of the business, management, including our chief operating decision maker, who is also our Chief Executive Officer, reviews certain financial information, including segmented internal profit and loss statements prepared on a basis not consistent with GAAP.

However, due to the integrated structure of our business, certain revenue recognized and costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. Revenue from certain contracts is allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and services, which can include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit margin. Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative revenue methodology. Operating expenses that are allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple segments benefit and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin. In addition, certain costs incurred at a corporate level that are identifiable and that benefit our segments are allocated to them. These allocated costs include costs of: legal, including settlements and fines; information technology; human resources; finance; excise taxes; field selling; shared facilities services; and customer service and support. Each allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs being allocated. Certain corporate-level activity is not allocated to our segments, including restructuring expenses.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated August 1, 2019, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the Company’s Audit Committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 93 PART II Item 8 Revenue Recognition — Refer to Note 1 to the F inancial S tatements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company recognizes revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. The Company offers customers the ability to acquire multiple licenses of software products and services, including cloud-based services, in its customer agreements through its volume licensing programs. Significant judgment is exercised by the Company in determining revenue recognition for these customer agreements, and includes the following: • Determination of whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together, such as software licenses and related services that are sold with cloud-based services. • Determination of stand-alone selling prices for each distinct performance obligation and for products and services that are not sold separately. • The pattern of delivery (i.e., timing of when revenue is recognized) for each distinct performance obligation. • Estimation of variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize (e.g., customer credits, incentives, and in certain instances, estimation of customer usage of products and services). Given these factors, the related audit effort in evaluating management’s judgments in determining revenue recognition for these customer agreements was extensive and required a high degree of auditor judgment. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our principal audit procedures related to the Company’s revenue recognition for these customer agreements included the following: • We tested the effectiveness of internal controls related to the identification of distinct performance obligations, the determination of the timing of revenue recognition, and the estimation of variable consideration. • We evaluated management’s significant accounting policies related to these customer agreements for reasonableness. • We selected a sample of customer agreements and performed the following procedures: • Obtained and read contract source documents for each selection, including master agreements, and other documents that were part of the agreement. • Tested management’s identification of significant terms for completeness, including the identification of distinct performance obligations and variable consideration. • Assessed the terms in the customer agreement and evaluated the appropriateness of management’s application of their accounting policies, along with their use of estimates, in the determination of revenue recognition conclusions. • We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s estimate of stand-alone selling prices for products and services that are not sold separately. • We tested the mathematical accuracy of management’s calculations of revenue and the associated timing of revenue recognized in the financial statements. 94 PART II Item 8 Income Taxes — Uncertain Tax Positions — Refer to Note 1 2 to the F inancial S tatements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company’s long-term income taxes liability includes uncertain tax positions related to transfer pricing issues that remain unresolved with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). The Company remains under IRS audit, or subject to IRS audit, for tax years subsequent to 2003. While the Company has settled a portion of the IRS audits, resolution of the remaining matters could have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements. Conclusions on recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions involve significant estimates and management judgment and include complex considerations of the Internal Revenue Code, related regulations, tax case laws, and prior-year audit settlements. Given the complexity and the subjective nature of the transfer pricing issues that remain unresolved with the IRS, evaluating management’s estimates relating to their determination of uncertain tax positions required extensive audit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment, including involvement of our tax specialists. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our principal audit procedures to evaluate management’s estimates of uncertain tax positions related to unresolved transfer pricing issues included the following: • We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management’s methods and assumptions used in the identification, recognition, measurement, and disclosure of uncertain tax positions, which included testing the effectiveness of the related internal controls. • We read and evaluated management’s documentation, including relevant accounting policies and information obtained by management from outside tax specialists, that detailed the basis of the uncertain tax positions. • We tested the reasonableness of management’s judgments regarding the future resolution of the uncertain tax positions, including an evaluation of the technical merits of the uncertain tax positions. • For those uncertain tax positions that had not been effectively settled, we evaluated whether management had appropriately considered new information that could significantly change the recognition, measurement or disclosure of the uncertain tax positions. • We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s estimates by considering how tax law, including statutes, regulations and case law, impacted management’s judgments. /s/ D ELOITTE & T OUCHE LLP Seattle, Washington August 1, 2019 We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1983. 95 PART II Item 9, 9A ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOU NTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE Not applicable. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective. REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our consolidated financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of company assets are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our consolidated financial statements would be prevented or detected. Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 30, 2019. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Deloitte & Touche LLP has audited our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2019; their report is included in Item 9A. 96 PART II Item 9A REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGIST ERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Microsoft Corporation Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Microsoft Corporation and subsidiaries (the ""Company"") as of June 30, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2019, based on the criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”) as of and for the year ended June 30, 2019, of the Company and our report dated August 1, 2019, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ D ELOITTE & T OUCHE LLP Seattle, Washington August 1, 2019 97 PART II, III Item 9B, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 ITEM 9B.

Business Company Overview We are a leading theme park and entertainment company providing experiences that matter and inspiring guests to protect animals and the wild wonders of our world. We own or license a portfolio of recognized brands including SeaWorld, Busch Gardens, Aquatica, Discovery Cove and Sesame Place. Over our more than 60-year history, we have developed a diversified portfolio of 12 differentiated theme parks that are grouped in key markets across the United States. Many of our theme parks showcase our one-of-a-kind zoological collection and feature a diverse array of both thrill and family-friendly rides, educational presentations, shows and/or other attractions with broad demographic appeal which deliver memorable experiences and a strong value proposition for our guests. We generate revenue primarily from selling admission to our theme parks and from purchases of food, merchandise and other items, primarily within our theme parks. For more information concerning our results from operations, see the “ Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As one of the world’s foremost zoological organizations and a global leader in animal welfare, training, husbandry, veterinary care and marine animal rescue, we are committed to helping protect and preserve the oceans, environment and the natural world. For more information, see the “—Our Culture and Social Responsibility” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Recent Developments Impact of Global COVID-19 Pandemic Our results of operations for 2022 continued to be impacted by the global COVID-19 pandemic due in part to a decline in both international and group-related attendance from historical levels. Additionally, our results of operations for 2021 and 2020 were impacted by the following factors: (i) capacity limitations, modified/limited operations and/or temporary park closures which were in place for portions of the respective periods; (ii) decreased demand due to public concerns and government restrictions associated with the pandemic; and (iii) severe restrictions on international travel. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and in compliance with government restrictions, we temporarily closed all of our theme parks effective March 16, 2020. Beginning in June 2020, we began the phased reopening of some of our parks with enhanced health, safety and cleaning measures, capacity limitations and/or modified/limited operations, which at times included reduced hours and/or reduced operating days. By the end of August 2020, we had reopened 10 of our 12 parks on a limited basis and by the end of the second quarter of 2021, all of our 12 parks were open, and operating without COVID-19 related capacity limitations. The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a material impact on our financial results. See further discussion in the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the “ Risk Factors” sections included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in Note 1–Description of the Business in the notes in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Current Operating Environment Our Board has formed a number of committees and held certain meetings and operational review sessions designed to provide further assistance from Board members with expertise in certain areas by providing enhanced oversight over the operations of the Company. As a result, in the current operating environment, certain members of our Board, including our Chairman of the Board, are actively involved in overseeing certain key operating activities and decisions. The current condition of the overall labor market, including wage inflationary pressures, the challenging current operating environment and COVID-19 related factors has led to increased turnover throughout the company and challenges in meeting our staffing goals. These staffing challenges have also led to wage pressures and less than optimal staffing levels, which have impacted and could continue to impact our ability to open some of our food and beverage and retail outlets, caused us to temporarily close some rides or attractions, and/or caused longer wait times in certain areas of our parks, which has and could continue to impact the guest experience. To address these items, we continue our efforts to recruit and retain talent, optimize staffing levels and focus on park operations from the guest perspective, among other initiatives. We have also been impacted by significant inflationary pressures (particularly relating to the costs for labor, goods, freight, services and capital projects), supply chain disruptions (which has, at times, impacted ride availability) and higher interest rates. We have heightened our focus on cost reduction and efficiency opportunities as well as incremental pricing and revenue opportunities to help offset cost pressures. For further discussion relating to strategic measures we have taken to operate in the current environment, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 1–Description of the Business in the notes in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For other factors concerning the current operating environment and the COVID-19 pandemic, see the “ Risk Factors ” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “ The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our business and could adversely affect our results of operations and/or various 4 other factors beyond our control could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations ” and “ If we fail to hire and/or retain employees, our business may be adversely affected ”. In March 2022, we opened our Sesame Place San Diego park which has been, and is expected to continue to be, open more operating days than the Aquatica San Diego park it replaced, particularly in the first and fourth quarters of the year. Additionally, during 2021 we began year-round operations at our SeaWorld park in Texas and began to strategically add additional operating days at both our Busch Gardens park in Virginia and our Sesame Place park in Pennsylvania. Our Competitive Strengths 5 In 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we provided complimentary distance learning resources for students, teachers and parents to use as schools shifted to virtual classrooms. These resources included standards-aligned classroom activities, teacher’s guides, videos, and animal information books. By providing these distance learning resources, we were able to help families explore, discover, and stay connected virtually in a fun and inspiring environment even while our parks were temporarily closed. We continue to provide and update these educational resources to encourage continuous learning. We also partner with charities across the country whose values and missions are aligned with our own by providing financial support, in-kind resources, strategic guidance, and/or hands-on volunteer work. For example, we are one of the primary supporters and a corporate member of the SeaWorld & Busch Gardens Conservation Fund, a non-profit conservation foundation, which makes grants to wildlife research and conservation projects that protect wildlife and wild places worldwide. In addition, we operate one of the world’s most respected rescue programs for ill and injured marine animals, in collaboration with federal, state and local governments, and other members of accredited stranding networks, among others, with the goal of rehabilitating and returning them to the wild. Over our history, our animal experts have helped over 40,000 ill, injured, orphaned and abandoned wild animals. We are committed to animal rescue, conservation research and education and invest millions annually in these efforts. Our Theme Parks Our legacy started in 1959 with the opening of our first Busch Gardens theme park in Tampa, Florida. Since then, we have grown our portfolio of strong brands and strategically expanded across five states on approximately 2,000 acres of owned land and 190 acres of leased property in San Diego. Our theme parks offer guests a variety of exhilarating experiences, from animal encounters that invite exploration and appreciation of the natural world, to both thrilling and family-friendly rides, educational presentations and spectacular shows. Our theme parks also provide guests special events and concerts throughout the year, including our Seven Seas Food Festivals, Food & Wine Festivals, Craft Beer Festivals, Sesame Street Kids’ Weekends, Inside Look behind the scenes events, Viva La Musica music celebrations and Summer Nights and Electric Ocean summer events. Additionally, we feature special seasonal events such as our Halloween Spooktacular and Howl-O-Scream events and our Christmas, Hanukkah and Kwanzaa events, along with a variety of other events or festivals throughout the year for holidays such as Lunar New Year, Mardi Gras and Cinco de Mayo. Our theme parks are consistently recognized among the top theme parks in the world and rank among the most highly attended in the industry. See further discussion of our recent awards and recognition in the theme park portfolio table which follows. Also see a discussion of our new rides and attractions under the Capital Improvements section. We generally locate our theme parks in geographic clusters, which we believe improves our ability to serve guests by providing them with a varied, comprehensive vacation experience and valuable multi-park pricing packages, as well as improving our operating efficiency through shared overhead costs. Our portfolio of branded theme parks includes the following (see the theme park portfolio table which follows for more details on each of these parks): 6 7 See additional discussion concerning the license agreement with Sesame Workshop in the “— Intellectual Property ” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The table which follows represents our theme park portfolio in 2022 and some of our recent awards and recognition. 8 Location Theme Park Year Opened Awards/Recognition 2022 Theme Park Portfolio (c) Animal Habitats (d) Rides (e) Pro- grams (f) Other (g) Orlando, FL 1973 17 13 24 46 2000 5 3 0 10 2008 3 14 0 6 Tampa, FL 1959 14 28 33 52 1980 0 13 0 5 San Diego, CA 1964 21 16 13 26 1996 (a) 0 15 0 11 San Antonio, TX 1988 7 13 27 45 2016 (b) 3 14 0 7 9 Location Theme Park Year Opened Awards/Recognition 2022 Theme Park Portfolio (c) Animal Habitats (d) Rides (e) Pro- grams (f) Other (g) Williamsburg, VA 1975 5 36 16 35 1984 0 16 0 5 Langhorne, PA 1980 0 24 20 50 Total (h) 75 205 133 298 10 Capital Improvements We make annual targeted investments to support our existing theme park facilities and attractions, as well as enable the development of new theme park attractions and infrastructure. Maintaining and improving our theme parks, as well as opening new attractions, is critical to remain competitive, grow revenue and increase our guests’ length of stay. During 2022, we opened numerous new rides and attractions including 5 of the top 10 Best New Amusement Park Attractions of 2022, led by Ice Breaker at SeaWorld Orland o which ranked #1 ( USA Today , 2022) . For 2023, we believe we have a strong line-up of new rides, attractions, events and upgrades, including, something new and meaningful planned in every one of our parks. This includes the following new rides and attractions expected to open in 2023: In order to manage costs and expenditures and to maximize liquidity in response to the temporary park closures and limited reopenings related to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, we substantially reduced or deferred all capital expenditures starting in March 2020 (other than minimal essential capital expenditures) when the parks were closed and postponed the opening of certain rides that were still under construction and originally scheduled to open in 2020. We were able to open certain new attractions in 2020 including our award-winning Texas Stingray coaster at SeaWorld San Antonio and in 2021, we opened Riptide Race at Aquatica Orlando. During 2022, we opened the remaining rides which had been previously delayed from 2020. Safety, Maintenance and Inspection Safety is of utmost importance to us. Maintenance at our theme parks is a key component of safety and guest service and includes two areas of focus: (i) facilities and infrastructure and (ii) rides and attractions. Facilities and infrastructure maintenance consists of all functions associated with upkeep, repair, preventative maintenance, code compliance and improvement of theme park infrastructure. This area is staffed with a combination of external contractors/suppliers and our employees. Rides and attractions maintenance represents all functions dedicated to the inspection, upkeep, repair and testing of guest experiences, particularly rides. Rides and attractions maintenance is also staffed with a combination of external suppliers, inspectors, and our employees, who work to assure that ride experiences are operating within, and that maintenance is conducted according to, the manufacturer’s criteria, internal standards, industry best practice and standards (such as ASTM International, formerly known as the American Society for Testing and Materials), state or jurisdictional requirements, as well as the ride designer or manufacturer’s specifications. All ride maintenance personnel are trained to perform their duties according to internal training processes, in addition to recognized industry certification programs for maintenance leadership. Every ride at our theme parks is inspected regularly, according to daily, weekly, monthly, and annual schedules, by both park maintenance experts and external consultants. Additionally, all rides are inspected daily by maintenance personnel before use by guests to ensure proper and safe operation. A networked enterprise software system is used to plan and track various maintenance activities, in order to schedule and request work, track completion progress and manage costs of parts and materials. 11 In addition to our day-to-day maintenance and inspection practices for the existing rides in our parks, before new rides are introduced to our guests, an extensive review of the ride, from design through installation, is conducted by the ride manufacturer, internal technical and operational experts, local authorities, as well as competent third-party inspectors and engineers. Additionally, all new rides are analyzed according to a standardized, internal evaluation and acceptance process, which reviews, among other things, that the new ride operates safely and as intended, that the associated site and facility requirements for the ride operation are met, that the appropriate training of our employees is conducted, and that operational and maintenance procedures are documented. Environmental and Social Responsibility As a purpose-driven company, our culture is built on our mission to provide experiences that matter for our guests and, in many of our parks, inspiring our guests to protect animals and the wild wonders of our world. Our management team and our employees, often referred to as ambassadors, are committed to social responsibility and strive to connect people to nature and animals and to do so in a socially responsible manner. We create an environment in our theme parks, where each guest can explore a diverse range of experiences meant to inspire and motivate them to join us in protecting animals and our planet. Our purpose and focus on creating experiences that matter for our guests are integral to our organization and the cornerstone of our success. Animal Care and Rescue We provide care for one of the largest zoological collections in the world. Our commitment to these animals includes applying world-class standards of care, while striving to provide habitats that promote the health of the animals. During our temporary park closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, essential personnel, including our animal care experts, continued to provide for the health, safety, and nutritional needs of all of the animals in our care. Our animal care team is among the most experienced and qualified in the world, making SeaWorld a global leader in animal welfare, husbandry, enrichment, and veterinary care. The zoological programs of all three SeaWorld parks, Discovery Cove and Busch Gardens Tampa Bay are validated by several professional zoological assessing organizations. Our parks are accredited members of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (“AZA”), one of the foremost professional zoological organizations in the world. In addition, our three SeaWorld parks and Discovery Cove are accredited by the Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums (“AMMPA”), an association specifically focused on the care of marine mammals. SeaWorld’s facilities have also received accreditation from the International Marine Animal Trainers’ Association (“IMATA”), whose Animal Trainer Development Program was developed to recognize those facilities that have exceptional systems for training animal care givers in the science and art of animal training, while utilizing positive reinforcement. And lastly, all three SeaWorld parks, Aquatica Orlando, Discovery Cove and Busch Gardens Tampa Bay are Certified Humane by Humane Conservation, an animal welfare certification standard developed by the independent third-party organization American Humane. We take a comprehensive approach to ensuring the health and welfare of the animals in our care that focuses on physical, behavioral and population health. Our animal care team includes board-certified veterinarians, technicians, and animal care experts, and we have onsite animal hospitals at each SeaWorld park and a guest-facing, state-of-the-art Animal Care Center at our Busch Gardens park in Tampa, Florida. We have also been at the forefront of advancing understanding and best practice-related behavioral health in animals. We are committed to caring for each individual animal, and to being responsible stewards of our animal populations, including ensuring that we maintain the genetic diversity needed for healthy and self-sustaining populations. We have invested significantly in developing leading-edge reproductive health expertise, technologies, and capabilities. Our focus on population health is also driven by our goal of helping to support, and our participation in, Species Survival Plans, which are ultimately aimed at preserving species in the wild. We apply high quality and comprehensive animal care standards, and actively work to advance knowledge and improve standards. We do this by contributing to research and sharing our insights with other zoological organizations around the world. For example, our continued work to define the clinically normal, healthy ranges for key measures in marine animals in our parks has helped to establish and refine the standards used by many veterinarians to assess both wild and managed marine species. This ongoing research also includes defining the basic biology and physiology of animals in our population. The combined results of these continued research efforts have provided and will continue to provide essential information and tools to help formulate plans to protect species in their natural habitats. 12 We are also a leader in animal rescue. Working in partnership with state, local and federal agencies, our rescue teams are on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year, including during our temporary park closures in 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Consistent with our mission to protect animals and their ecosystems, our rescue teams mobilize and often travel hundreds of miles to help ill, injured, orphaned or abandoned wild animals in need of our expert care, with the goal of returning then to their natural habitat. Over our history, we have helped over 40,000 animals across a number of species including bottlenose dolphins, manatees, sea lions, seals, sea turtles, sharks, birds and more. For example, we work closely with Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission (the “FWC”) and in the past six years have helped over 300 manatees as human caused pressures increase. We have one of the largest manatee rescue operations in the world and operate one of only five manatee critical care facilities in the U.S. In response to the growing number of manatees in crisis, during 2022 we announced plans to double the size of our manatee rescue facility at SeaWorld Orlando . Our commitment to animals also extends beyond our theme parks and throughout the world. We actively participate in species conservation and rescue efforts as discussed in the “— Conservation and Community Relations ” section which follows. Conservation and Community Relations Our purpose is to inspire people to protect animals and the wild wonders of the world, and a critical way we deliver on this is by providing our guests opportunities to explore and interact with the animals in our parks. Through our up-close animal encounters, educational exhibits, “Inside Look” events, educational presentations, and innovative entertainment, we strive to inspire each guest to take action to care for and conserve the natural world. Some of the animals in our care serve as ambassadors for their species through public appearances that educate the public and raise awareness for issues facing wildlife and wild places. We also partner with and support leading research, education and conservation organizations that help protect species of animals at risk in the wild, as well as the habitats that are home to many vulnerable species. For example, we are working alongside various resource management agencies, including the FWC, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries, the Fish and Wildlife Foundation of Florida, and other zoological facilities, to save Florida's endangered coral reef by contributing resources and expertise to the Florida Coral Rescue Center (the “FCRC”). The FCRC is an environmental conservation effort located in Orlando, Florida that aims to provide a safe and stable home for coral colonies to receive world-class care from a team of experts, including experts from SeaWorld. The FCRC was established for gene banking and care of corals rescued from reefs not yet affected by disease impacting corals in the wild. We have supported conservation efforts such as the Killer Whale Research and Conservation Program, in partnership with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, to study and protect endangered killer whales in the wild, with a particular focus on the Southern Resident killer whale population found off the coast of Washington. Another example is a partnership with marine wildlife artist and conservationist Guy Harvey focused on ocean health and the plight of sharks in the wild. We also continue to support the Hubbs-SeaWorld Research Institute, which was started nearly 60 years ago by one of SeaWorld’s founders and remains a world-renowned scientific research organization committed to conserving and renewing marine life to ensure a healthier planet. As part of our commitment to education and conservation efforts, we have entered into partnerships on some of our rides and attractions including with the following conservation organizations: the Alaska SeaLife Center on our Ice Breaker at SeaWorld Orlando ride which highlights animal rescue and climate change in the Arctic region; Penguins International on our Emperor ride at SeaWorld San Diego which focuses on penguin awareness and conservation; and the Wilderness Foundation Africa on our Iron Gwazi ride at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay which highlights the plight of endangered African wildlife. Alongside our conservation work, we are committed to giving back to the communities in which our theme parks are located. We focus our philanthropic efforts in three areas: animal preservation and stewardship; youth development and education; and community initiatives that address environmental sustainability. We partner with charities across the country whose values and missions are aligned with our own by providing financial support, in-kind resources, strategic guidance and/or hands-on volunteer work. Additionally, our ambassadors are actively involved in volunteer activities, such as beach and river cleanup efforts, fun run charity fundraisers, local food bank distributions and more. We also provide complimentary tickets and discounts to educators as well as active and former military and their families. Sustainable Operations Environmental conservation is implicit in our purpose. To thrive, animals need vibrant ecosystems and healthy habitats. We understand the adverse effects of human behavior and climate change on ecosystems and the animals who call them home; therefore, we are constantly working to minimize the footprint of our operations. As a part of our commitment to conservation, we have invested in numerous projects to reduce our energy and water use and the amount of waste we generate. 13 Energy Efficiency We are evaluating the ways in which we can reduce our fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions to better align with our mission to protect animals and the natural ecosystems on which they rely. Over the past few years, we have continued to make investments in renewable energy and greater energy efficiency at our parks and buildings such as solar panels, LED lighting retrofits, adding variable-frequency drive to motors and enhancing other mechanical systems. Renewable and energy efficiency highlights include the solar carport system at Sesame Place San Diego, which not only generates up to 90% of the park’s annual energy needs but also provides over 400 shaded parking spots for guests and employees. In our data operations, we have adopted processes that decrease energy usage at on-premise data centers, including transitioning gradually to cloud storage. In addition to lowering our overall electrical consumption, these measures are designed to improve our data security posture. Water Stewardship Given our dedication to protecting marine animals and their habitats, water stewardship is naturally one of our key focus areas. Our parks and operations rely heavily upon water, and we continually seek innovative ways of reducing water usage, whether through updating our parks’ animal habitats with new filtration technology strategies, using best practices wherever possible, or installing drought-tolerant landscaping. We believe our parks have some of the most advanced and efficient water purification systems in the world, which provide the optimum environment for our marine life. We leverage this knowledge to reclaim and recycle wastewater for reuse, thereby decreasing our consumption of fresh water. We have also implemented a range of other water conservation efforts across our parks, including a natural biofiltration system in 2019 at SeaWorld San Antonio, which is the first of its kind in a zoological setting. Many of our water conservation efforts incorporate lessons from our facilities in San Diego and San Antonio, which, driven in part by drought conditions, have found innovative opportunities to harvest rainwater, reuse water for cooling buildings, and adapt landscaping to require less water. We continually look for new ways to reduce water use in our parks and to support water conservation projects elsewhere. Waste Management We see the impacts of marine debris and litter along shorelines and in coastal waters, estuaries, and oceans – a visible reminder of the need to reduce waste. We are doing our part by implementing programs to generate less waste in our parks. At all our parks, we have implemented a range of waste-reduction and resource conservation initiatives, including: (i) removing all expanded polystyrene products from the parks; (ii) removing all plastic straws, plastic coffee stir sticks and plastic shopping bags as of 2018; (iii) using fibers certified by the Forest Stewardship Counsel (“FSC”) as sustainably sourced for printed materials when available; and (iv) minimizing the use of paper throughout our business by switching to online platforms and providing tablets for Environmental Health & Safety employees to use for accident investigation. We raise awareness with our employees and guests about the need for all of us to do our part to address this global challenge. Responsible Sourcing Corporate responsibility extends to how we source the goods and services needed to operate our parks and to serve our guests. We have established a Responsible Food Sourcing Policy, which outlines our commitment to partner with food suppliers that deliver products that meet or exceed sustainable, healthy and humane food standards. For example, our seafood is sourced from organizations that promote environmentally responsible fishing and farming processing and food safety practices, our eggs are certified cage-free, and we have made a commitment to purchase commodity pork cuts from suppliers who have announced a commitment to humane farming practices. In response to growing guest demand, we have also taken steps to expand the number of plant-based food offerings on our menus across our parks. As part of these efforts, in 2019, we added a sustainable, plant-based burger to our menus at all of our parks. We have also taken additional steps, where possible, to identify and partner with brands and products in our parks which share our commitment to giving back to communities, animals, and/or our broader environment. Human Capital Management We have a diverse and mission-driven team of employee ambassadors. Our team makes it possible each day to provide our guests with experiences that matter and to inspire them to protect animals and the wild wonders of our world. As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 3,200 full-time employees and approximately 11,900 part-time and seasonal employees. During our peak operating season in 2022, we employed additional part-time and seasonal employees, including high school and college students. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Our focus on recruiting and developing diverse talent has resulted in a management team that is approximately 48% female and 34% of a minority ethnicity. Similarly, our overall workforce is 51% women and 56% of a minority ethnicity. We don’t simply view diversity as a target, but rather a continual commitment to focus on creating the best and most inclusive workplace possible by recognizing and celebrating our unique backgrounds. We strive to provide our ambassadors with a competitive compensation package using market data including comprehensive benefits. We provide benefits including health, dental, vision, disability, life insurance, retirement, paid time-off, complimentary tickets and various other benefits. 14 We provide training and require certifications for certain positions. We routinely review all procedures and safety requirements to promote a safe working environment for our ambassadors, guests and animals. We believe that working for our Company is more than a job – it is a commitment to the protection of animals and the wild wonders of our world, while also providing a fun and meaningful experience for our guests that will be remembered long after they leave our parks. We create memories that matter. Our human capital programs, policies, and initiatives will continue to reinforce this belief in the years ahead. Our Products and Services Admission Tickets We generate most of our revenue from selling admission to our theme parks. We engage with travel agents, ticket resellers and travel agencies, and directly with our guests through our websites and social media, to promote advanced ticket sales and provide guest convenience and ease of entry. Guests who visit our theme parks have the option of purchasing multiple types of admission tickets, from single and multi-day tickets to season or annual passes. In addition, visitors can purchase vacation packages with preferred hotels, behind-the-scenes tours and educational animal encounters, specialty dining packages, and front of the line “Quick Queue” access to enhance their experience. We actively use pricing and promotions to manage capacity and maximize revenue. We utilize demand-based pricing for select peak time periods at some of our parks, advance purchase discounts to encourage early commitment, and seasonal pricing models to drive demand in non-peak time periods. In-Park Offerings We generate revenue from the sale of in-park products and services, primarily consisting of food, beverage and merchandise items. Food and Beverage Offerings We strive to deliver a variety of high quality, creative and memorable food and beverage experiences for our guests. Our culinary team focuses on providing creative menu offerings and ways to deliver those offerings that appeal to our diverse guest base. We also offer a variety of dining programs that we believe provide quality food and great value to our guests and drive incremental revenues. While our menu offerings have broad appeal, they also cater to guests who desire healthy options and those with special allergy-related needs. Our all-day-dining program delivers convenience and value to our guests with numerous restaurant choices for one price for the entirety of their day visit to the park. We also offer creative immersive dining experiences that allow guests to dine up-close with our animals and characters. Our commitment to care for the natural world extends to the food that we serve. Some of our menus feature sustainable, organic, seasonal, and locally grown ingredients that aim to minimize environmental impacts to animals and their habitats. In addition, through our ongoing culinary supply chain management initiatives, we believe we are well-positioned to take advantage of changing economic and market conditions. Merchandise and Other In-Park Service Offerings We offer guests the opportunity to capture memories through our products and services, including through traditional retail shops, game venues and customized photos. We make a focused effort to leverage the emotional connection of the theme park experiences, capitalize on trends, and optimize brand alignment with our merchandise product offerings. In-park games are designed with the goal of creating positive family experiences for guests of every age. Our merchandise teams also focus on making a visit to our theme parks easy, convenient, and comfortable. This includes offering quick queue passes for front of the line access to popular attractions, reserved seating, cabana rentals and other guest conveniences like lockers or service vehicle rentals such as strollers, electric personal carts and wheelchairs. Consumer Products and Licensing To capitalize on our popular brands, we leverage content through licensing and consumer product arrangements. We developed licensed consumer products to drive consumer sales through retail channels beyond our theme parks and continue to look for this channel to grow. While currently these licensed consumer products do not represent a significant percentage of our total revenue, we believe by leveraging our brands and our intellectual property through consumer products, we will create new revenue streams and enhance the value of our brands through greater brand visibility, consumer awareness and increased consumer loyalty. In addition, we have expanded our brand appeal through strategic alliances with well-known external brands, including Sesame Street and Build-A-Bear. We have also incorporated Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and other well-known characters into five of our park holiday programs under a license agreement with Character Arts, LLC, which currently runs through January 2024. 15 Group Events At times we host a variety of different group events and meetings at our theme parks, both during the day and at night. Our parks provide a wide variety of unique venues, backdrops and products for groups and include venues such as the icy walls of Antarctica, concert ready stadiums, outdoor pavilions, animal habitats and fully air-conditioned ballrooms. Our special group ticket packages and offerings appeal to specialty markets such as youth, sports, social (e.g., family reunions) and fraternal groups, as well as corporate groups seeking to recognize and reward their employees. Park buy-outs have historically allowed groups to enjoy exclusive itineraries, including meetings, educational presentations and shows, up-close encounters with animals and behind-the-scenes tours. Our group facilities are available year-round and fully customizable as they can be built around any of the park’s special events, educational presentations, inspirational shows, or one-of-a-kind attractions. Each of our theme parks offers attractive venues, such as SeaWorld Orlando’s Ports of Call, a 70,000 square foot dedicated special events complex and banquet facility that includes a ballroom, a collection of four outdoor pavilions and a courtyard in Orlando, or a fully enclosed and air-conditioned pavilion in Tampa. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related impacts, group events and/or attendance in 2022, 2021 and 2020 were impacted. See the “— Impact of Global COVID-19 Pandemic ” and “Risk Factors ” sections included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial performance. Corporate Sponsorships and Strategic Alliances We seek to secure long-term corporate sponsorships and strategic alliances with leading companies and brands that share our core values, deliver significant brand value, and influence and drive mutual business gains. We identify prospective corporate sponsors based on their industry and industry-leading position, and we select them based on their ability to deliver impactful value to our theme parks and our brands, as well as to consumer products and various entertainment platforms. Our corporate sponsors contribute to us in a multitude of ways, such as through direct marketing, advertising, media exposure and licensing opportunities. Some of our corporate sponsors, such as our partners at Coca-Cola, also join us in making an impact on conservation efforts through contributions to the non-profit SeaWorld & Busch Gardens Conservation Fund. Also see additional discussion concerning our conservation partnerships, such as Guy Harvey, in the “ —Conservation and Community Relations” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Seasonality See the seasonality discussion in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our Markets, Guests and Customers Our theme parks are entertainment venues with broad demographic appeal and are located near a number of large metropolitan areas, including 6 of the 10 most populous metropolitan areas in the United States and 7 of the top 25 Popular Destinations in the United States (U.S. Census, 2022; TripAdvisor, 2022) . Additionally, because our theme parks are divided between regional and destination theme parks, historically our guests have included local visitors, non-local domestic visitors and international visitors. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related impacts, travel from domestic and/or international markets were impacted in 2020, 2021 and 2022. See the “— Impact of Global COVID-19 Pandemic ” and “Risk Factors ” sections included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. Intellectual Property Our business is affected by our ability to protect against infringement of our intellectual property, including our trademarks, service marks, domain names, copyrights, and other proprietary rights. Important intellectual property includes rights in names, logos, character likenesses, theme park attractions and systems related to the study and care of certain of our animals. In addition, we are party to key license agreements as licensee, including our agreements with Anheuser-Busch, Incorporated (“ABI”) and Sesame Workshop (“Sesame”) as discussed below. Busch Gardens License Agreement Our subsidiary, SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment LLC, is a party to a trademark license agreement with ABI, which governs our use of the Busch Gardens name and logo. Under the license agreement, ABI granted to us a perpetual, exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use the Busch Gardens trademark and certain related domain names in connection with the operation, marketing, promotion and advertising of our theme parks, as well as in connection with the production, use, distribution and sale of merchandise sold in connection with such theme parks. 16 The license extends to our Busch Gardens theme parks located in Williamsburg, Virginia and Tampa, Florida, and may also include any amusement or theme park anywhere in the world that we acquire, build or rebrand with the Busch Gardens name in the future, subject to certain conditions. ABI may not assign, transfer or sell the Busch Gardens mark without first granting us a reasonable right of first refusal to purchase such mark. We have agreed to indemnify ABI from and against third party claims and losses arising out of or in connection with the operation of the theme parks and the related marketing or promotion thereof, any merchandise branded with the licensed marks and the infringement of a third party’s intellectual property. We are required to carry certain insurance coverage throughout the term of the license. The license agreement can be terminated by ABI under certain limited circumstances, including in connection with certain types of change of control of SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment LLC. Sesame License Agreement Our wholly-owned subsidiary, SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc. (“SEA”), is a party to a license agreement with Sesame, a New York not-for-profit corporation. The License Agreement extends SEA’s status as Sesame’s exclusive theme park partner in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands (the “Sesame Territory”), with a second Sesame Place ® theme park which opened in 2022. We opened our second Sesame Place theme park at the site of the former Aquatica San Diego in March 2022. We also have the option to build additional Sesame Place theme parks in the Sesame Territory. Under the terms of the license agreement, including the requirement for certain subsequent approvals from Sesame, Sesame granted SEA the right to use the Sesame Street Elements (as defined below) (a) in connection with the design, building, installation, theming, promotion, and operation of SEA’s existing Sesame Place theme park, located in Langhorne, Pennsylvania (the “Langhorne Sesame Place”) and additional Sesame Place theme parks in the United States, including Sesame Place San Diego (collectively, the “Standalone Parks”); (b) in connection with the design, building, installation, theming, promotion, and operation of SEA’s existing Sesame Lands (currently known as Sesame Street ® Land at SeaWorld Orlando, which opened in spring of 2019, Sesame Street Bay of Play at SeaWorld San Antonio, Sesame Street Bay of Play at SeaWorld San Diego, Sesame Street Safari of Fun at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay, and Sesame Street Forest of Fun at Busch Gardens Williamsburg) and additional Sesame Lands, (collectively, the “Sesame Lands”); (c) in connection with the Licensed Products (as defined below); (d) in marketing and promotional activities related to the Standalone Parks and Sesame Lands, including without limitation, marketing, advertising and promotion, character appearances and live presentations (both in park and in off-site promotional activities such as schools, parades, conventions, etc.), and the Licensed Products; and/or (e) to seek and to enter into sponsorship agreements for specific sponsorships of Sesame Street -themed attractions. In addition, SEA has been granted a license to (i) develop and manufacture or have developed and manufactured products that utilize the Sesame Street Elements or to purchase products that utilize the Sesame Street Elements from Sesame’s third party licensees (collectively, the “Licensed Products”), (ii) to market, promote, advertise, distribute and sell the Licensed Products within each of SEA’s theme parks and through online stores on SEA’s websites and targeted primarily to consumers in the United States and (iii) to contract with third party vendors to promote, distribute and sell the Licensed Products within the United States. The term “Sesame Street Elements” means all current and hereafter developed or owned titles, marks, names, characters (including any new Sesame Street characters shown on Sesame Street and owned in whole or controlled by Sesame), images, likenesses, audio, video, audiovisual, logos, themes, symbols, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, visual representations and designs, and other intellectual property (whether in two- or three-dimensional form and including animated and mechanical representations) owned or controlled by Sesame (or its affiliates), and associated with the “ Sesame Street ” television property, whether previously (unless retired) or currently on “ Sesame Street ” or whether hereafter developed or owned and the names and marks “ Sesame Place ” and “ Sesame Land, ” but expressly excluding “Kermit the Frog.” Sesame has reserved rights to build family entertainment centers using the Sesame Street Elements subject to certain territorial restrictions surrounding SEA’s Sesame Place Standalone Parks and Sesame Lands within the Sesame Territory. The license agreement has an initial term through December 31, 2031, with an automatic additional 15 year extension plus a 5 year option added from each new Standalone Park opening. Pursuant to the license agreement, SEA pays specified annual license fees, as well as a schedule of royalties based on revenues earned in connection with admissions, sales of Licensed Products, all food and beverage items utilizing the licensed elements and any events utilizing such elements if a separate fee is paid for such event. International Development Strategy We believe that in addition to the growth potential that exists domestically, our brands can also have significant appeal in certain international markets. We continue to make progress in our partnership with Miral Asset Management LLC to develop SeaWorld Abu Dhabi, a first-of-its-kind marine life themed park on Yas Island (the “Middle East Project”). As part of this partnership, we are providing certain services pertaining to the planning and design of the Middle East Project, with funding received from our partner in the Middle East expected to offset our internal expenses. We also receive additional funds from our partner related to certain agreed-upon services and reimbursements of costs incurred by us on behalf of the Middle East Project. The Middle East Project is on track with the park expected to open in 2023. Additionally, we continue to evaluate and assess other international opportunities which we 17 believe could provide additional value. For a discussion of certain risks associated with our international development strategy, including the Middle East Project, see the “ Risk Factors ” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “ Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry—We may not realize the benefits of developments, restructurings, acquisitions or other strategic initiatives .” Our Industry In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted the theme park industry causing complete shutdowns or extended periods of closure. Some theme parks chose to partially reopen with capacity limitations and enhanced safety protocols, which allowed them to resume operations but with lower levels of attendance. With the widespread introduction and reception of vaccines to fight COVID-19 in 2021, and further in 2022, the operating environment and attendance levels have generally improved; however, COVID-19 related factors have and could continue to impact domestic and international travel, group-related attendance and events, public opinion concerning social gatherings and consumer behavior. We believe that the theme park industry is an attractive sector characterized by a proven business model that over the long-term generates significant cash flow and has avenues for growth. Theme parks offer a strong consumer value proposition, particularly when compared to other forms of out-of-home entertainment such as concerts, sporting events, cruises and movies. As a result, theme parks attract a broad range of guests and generally exhibit strong operating margin across regions, operators, park types and macroeconomic conditions. Competition Our theme parks and other product and entertainment offerings compete directly for discretionary spending with other destination and regional theme parks and water and amusement parks and indirectly with other types of recreational facilities and forms of entertainment, including movies, home entertainment options, sports attractions, restaurants and vacation travel. Principal direct competitors of our theme parks include theme parks operated by The Walt Disney Company, Universal Parks and Resorts, Six Flags Entertainment Corporation, Cedar Fair, L.P., Merlin Entertainments ltd., and Hershey Entertainment and Resorts Company. Our highly differentiated products provide a value proposition and a complementary experience to those offered by fantasy-themed Disney and Universal parks. In addition, we benefit from the significant capital investments made in developing the tourism industry in the Orlando area. The Orlando theme park market is extremely competitive, with a high concentration of theme parks operated by several companies. Competition is based on multiple factors including location, price, the originality and perceived quality of the rides and attractions, the atmosphere and cleanliness of the theme park, the quality of food and entertainment, weather conditions, ease of travel to the theme park (including direct flights by major airlines), availability and cost of transportation to a theme park, industry best practices and perceptions as to safety. We believe we can compete effectively due to our strong brand recognition, unique and extensive zoological collection, diversity of product offerings and locations, targeted capital investments, guest sentiment related to our rescue and conservation efforts, and valuable real estate. Additionally, we believe that our theme parks feature a sufficient quality and variety of rides and attractions, educational and interactive experiences, merchandise locations, restaurants and family orientation to make them highly competitive with other destination and regional theme parks, as well as other forms of entertainment. Regulatory Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances including, but not limited to, those regulating the environment, display, possession and care of our animals, amusement park rides, building and construction, health and safety, labor and employment, workplace safety, zoning and land use and alcoholic beverage and food service. Key statutes and treaties relating to the display, possession and care of our zoological collection include the Endangered Species Act, Marine Mammal Protection Act, Animal Welfare Act, Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species and Fauna Protection Act and the Lacey Act. We must also comply with the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, Wild Bird Conservation Act and National Environmental Policy Act, among other laws and regulations. We believe that we are in compliance with applicable laws, regulations and ordinances; however, such requirements may change over time, and there can be no assurance that new requirements, changes in enforcement policies or newly discovered conditions relating to our properties or operations will not require significant expenditures in the future. 18 Recent Regulatory Developments The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”) released a proposed rule on February 3, 2016 to amend the Animal Welfare Act regulations concerning the humane handling, care and treatment of marine mammals in captivity (the “Proposed APHIS Regulations”). The Proposed APHIS Regulations were subject to public comment which ended on May 4, 2016. We submitted a comment letter to APHIS expressing our views on the Proposed APHIS Regulations. The full impact of the Proposed APHIS Regulations on our business will not be known until the Proposed APHIS Regulations are finalized. These Proposed APHIS Regulations were not listed as a priority for APHIS with the release in January 2023 of the Department of Agriculture’s latest Semiannual Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions for Fall 2022 (the “Fall 2022 Unified Agenda”) indicating that the agency did not plan any further action at that time on the matter. However, there can be no assurance that APHIS will not propose or enact regulations that could materially impact the Company in the future. APHIS did include in the Fall 2022 Unified Agenda a notice that it planned to issue a Final Rulemaking in the first quarter of 2023 to extend its enforcement of the Animal Welfare Act to birds, other than birds bred for use in research. APHIS says this would help ensure the humane care and treatment of such birds. The final APHIS regulations were published in the Federal Register on February 21, 2023. These regulations are not expected to materially impact our park’s avian operations. On December 3, 2021, APHIS released a Final Rule related to contingency plans for the handling of animals. This rulemaking, which became effective on January 3, 2022, amends Animal Welfare Act regulations to add requirements for contingency planning and training of personnel by research facilities and by dealers, exhibitors, intermediate handlers, and carriers. APHIS says this action will heighten the awareness of licensees and registrants regarding their responsibilities and help ensure a timely and appropriate response should an emergency or disaster occur. Effective on August 1, 2022, APHIS instituted new procedures for its Animal Welfare Act inspection of animal care facilities. During these inspections, APHIS animal care officials (""Animal Care Officials"") identify and document any instances of non-compliance or violations of the Animal Welfare Act. Prior to August 1, 2022, Animal Care Officials would document minor instances of non-compliance on a separate form and use them as “teachable moments.” Licensees that had multiple or serious instances of non-compliance were not eligible for teachable moments. At the direction of Congress, beginning on August 1, 2022, APHIS' use of teachable moments ended and instead they will be cited in inspection reports with any other non-compliance issues. On October 26, 2022, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (“USFWS) published a notice in the Federal Register to change the status of the emperor penguin to a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. SeaWorld is the only U.S. facility that houses this flightless bird species from Antarctica. This rule adds the species to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife. At the same time, USFWS also finalized a rule issued under the authority of section 4(d) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 that provides measures that are necessary and advisable to provide for the conservation of this species. The rule, which became effective on November 25, 2022, among other things prohibits the transport or breeding of Emperor Penguins. We do not expect the rule to have a material impact to the Company. On January 6, 2023, APHIS published an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (""ANPR"") pertaining to amendments to Wild and Exotic Animal Handling, Enrichment and Training Regulations. APHIS requested public comment on its plans to propose amendments to enhance regulations and standards for animals covered under the Animal Welfare Act in three areas: (i) public handling of wild and exotic animals at licensed exhibitors, (ii) the training of personnel who handle wild and exotic animals in these settings, and (iii) environmental enrichment to promote the psychological well-being of all species covered under the Animal Welfare Act. Comments must be received by April 10, 2023 and SeaWorld intends to submit a comment letter to APHIS expressing our views on this ANPR. On July 26, 2022, U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) introduced the Strengthening Welfare in Marine Settings Act of 2022 (""SWIMS Act""). This bill would establish prohibitions on capturing, importing, exporting, or breeding of orcas, beluga whales, false killer whales, or pilot whales for the purpose of public display. The bill would prohibit the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration from issuing any permit under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 that authorizes the taking (e.g., capturing) or importation of such orcas or whales for the purpose of public display. The bill would revise the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 to make it unlawful to export such orcas or whales, unless they are being transported to marine mammal sanctuaries or for release into the wild. Further, the bill would make it unlawful under the Animal Welfare Act for any person to breed or artificially inseminate such marine mammals for purposes of using their progeny for public display. The bill was referred to the House Agriculture Committee and House Natural Resources Committee. On August 2, 2022, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) introduced an identical version of the SWIMS Act in the U.S. Senate. The bill was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. No hearings or consideration of the bill was scheduled in the House or Senate before the 117th Congress adjourned on January 3, 2023. To date, the bill has not been reintroduced in the 118th Congress. For a discussion of certain risks associated with federal and state regulations governing the treatment of animals, see the “ Risk Factors ” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “ Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry—We are subject to complex federal and state regulations governing the treatment of animals, which can change, and to claims and lawsuits by activist groups before government regulators and in the courts. ” 19 We face a rapidly changing regulatory environment across our business, including responses to COVID-19, wages and hour regulations, employee health and benefit requirement and the policy agenda of the U.S. President and his administration to name a few. For more detailed discussion, see the “ Impact of Global COVID-19 Pandemic ” section and the following under the “ Risk Factors ” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, “ The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our business and could adversely affect our results of operations and/or various other factors beyond our control could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations; Increased labor costs and employee health and welfare benefits may negatively impact our operations; and The policies of the U.S. President and his administration or any changes to tax laws may result in a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial condition and may impact our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards.” Insurance We maintain insurance of the type and in the amounts that we believe to be commercially reasonable for businesses in our industry. We maintain primary and excess casualty coverage of up to $100.0 million. As part of this coverage, we retain deductible/self-insured retention exposures consistent with our normal expected losses related to general liability claims, automobile liability and workers’ compensation claims. We maintain employers’ liability and all coverage required by law in the states in which we operate. Defense costs are included in the insurance coverage we obtain against losses in these areas. Based upon our historical experience of reported claims and an estimate for incurred-but-not-reported claims, we accrue a liability for our deductible/self-insured retention contingencies regarding general liability, automobile liability and workers’ compensation exposures. We maintain additional forms of special casualty coverage which we believe is appropriate for our business. We also maintain commercial property coverage against fire, natural perils, so-called “extended coverage” perils such as civil commotion, business interruption and terrorism exposures for protection of our real and personal properties (other than land). We generally renegotiate our insurance policies on an annual basis. We cannot predict the amounts of premium cost that we may be required to pay for future insurance coverage, the level of any deductibles/self-insured retentions or co-insurance we may retain applicable thereto, the level of aggregate excess coverage available, the availability of coverage for special or specific risks or whether the amount of insurance will be sufficient to cover all actual perils that may occur. For example, our losses in 2020 related to the impacts of the COVID -19 pandemic were not covered by insurance available to us. Corporate History Our legacy started in 1959 with the opening of our first Busch Gardens theme park in Tampa, Florida. Since then, we have grown our portfolio of strong brands and strategically expanded across five states. On December 1, 2009, investment funds affiliated with The Blackstone Group L.P. and certain co-investors, through SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc. (“SEA”), acquired 100% of the equity interests of Sea World LLC (f/k/a Sea World, Inc.) and SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment LLC (f/k/a Busch Entertainment Corporation) from certain subsidiaries of Anheuser-Busch Companies, Inc. We refer to this acquisition and related financing transactions as the “2009 Transactions.” SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware on October 2, 2009 in connection with the 2009 Transactions and changed its name from SW Holdco, Inc. to SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. in December 2012. We completed our initial public offering (the “IPO”) in April 2013 and our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “SEAS”. On May 8, 2017, an affiliate of ZHG Group, Sun Wise (UK) Co., LTD. (“ZHG”) acquired approximately 21% of the then outstanding shares of our common stock from certain affiliates of Blackstone (the “Seller”), pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement between ZHG and the Seller (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”). ZHG pledged such shares in connection with certain loan obligations of ZHG (the “Pledged Shares”). ZHG subsequently defaulted on such loan obligations and, as a result, certain lenders (the “Lenders”) foreclosed on the Pledged Shares and, accordingly, the Pledged Shares were transferred to a security agent for the Lenders (the “Security Agent”), on May 3, 2019. On May 27, 2019, the Security Agent entered into a share repurchase agreement with us pursuant to which the Security Agent agreed to sell and we agreed to purchase 5,615,874 of the Pledged Shares held by the Security Agent (the “SEAS Repurchase”). On May 27, 2019, the Security Agent also entered into a stock purchase agreement with Hill Path Capital LP (“Hill Path”) and certain of its affiliates pursuant to which the Security Agent agreed to sell and certain affiliates of Hill Path agreed to purchase, in the aggregate, 13,214,000 of the Pledged Shares held by the Security Agent. The purchase closed on May 30, 2019. As of December 31, 2022, Hill Path owned approximately 42.6% of our total outstanding common stock. 20 Available Information Our website is http: // www.seaworldentertainment.com .

Ri sk Factors Risk Factor Summary We are providing the following summary of the risk factors contained in our Form 10-K to enhance the readability and accessibility of our risk factor disclosures. We encourage our stockholders to carefully review the full risk factors contained in this Form 10-K in their entirety for additional information regarding the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry 22 Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock 23 The following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating us and this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain statements in “Risk Factors” are forward-looking statements. See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” elsewhere in this report: Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry We could be adversely affected by a decline in discretionary consumer spending or consumer confidence including any unfavorable impacts from Federal Reserve interest rate actions and inflation, which may influence discretionary spending, unemployment or the overall economy. Our success depends to a significant extent on discretionary consumer spending. Some of the factors that may influence consumer spending on entertainment and recreational activities include general economic conditions, the availability of discretionary income, consumer confidence, high interest rates, domestic and global supply chain issues, high levels of unemployment, pandemics, higher consumer debt levels, reductions in net worth based on market declines and uncertainty, the housing market, fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates and credit availability, government measures, inflationary pressure, tax rates and general uncertainty regarding the overall future economic environment, including recessionary concerns. During 2022, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates seven times in response to concerns about inflation. The Federal Reserve also raised interest rates in February 2023 and it may raise them again. Higher interest rates and volatility in financial markets may increase economic uncertainty and negatively affect consumer spending. The demand for our parks, other entertainment and recreation activities generally, and discretionary travel is highly sensitive to downturns in the economy and the corresponding impact on discretionary consumer spending. Any actual or perceived deterioration or weakness in general, regional or local economic conditions, as well as other adverse economic or market conditions due to COVID-19 or otherwise, may reduce our customers’ discretionary income or willingness to spend on parks, entertainment, recreation activities and travel. An increase in general price levels (due to inflationary pressure, domestic and global supply chain issues or other macroeconomic factors) could also result in a shift in consumer demand away from discretionary spending, which would adversely affect our attendance or guest spending patterns and, at the same time, increase our operating costs. We may not be able to adequately increase our prices over time at price points that consumers are willing to pay to offset such increased costs. In the past, severe economic downturns, coupled with high volatility and uncertainty as to the future global economic landscape, have had an adverse effect on consumers’ discretionary income and consumer confidence. Volatile, negative, inflationary or uncertain economic conditions and recessionary periods may adversely impact attendance figures, the frequency with which guests choose to visit our theme parks and guest spending patterns at our theme parks. The actual or perceived weakness in the economy could also lead to decreased spending by our guests. For example, in 2009 and 2010, we experienced a decline in attendance as a result of the global economic crisis, which in turn adversely affected our revenue and profitability. Both attendance and total revenue per capita spending at our theme parks are key drivers of our revenue and profitability, and reductions in either can materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Various factors beyond our control could adversely affect attendance and guest spending patterns at our theme parks. Various factors beyond our control could adversely affect attendance and guest spending patterns at our theme parks. These factors could also affect our suppliers, vendors, insurance carriers and other contractual counterparties. Such factors include but are not limited to: 24 Any one or more of these factors could adversely affect attendance, revenue, and per capita spending at our theme parks, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and inflation impact our business. A strong dollar increases the cost for international tourists and inflationary pressures increase the cost of living which could impact guest’s willingness to visit our parks or guest spending. In addition, demand for our parks is highly dependent on the general environment for travel and tourism, which can be significantly adversely affected by extreme weather events, including ice and snow conditions. In 2022 and 2021, the United States encountered increased inflation and we experienced increased costs for labor, goods, food, merchandise, services and capital projects. Inflation increases the cost of goods we purchase, capital projects, wages and benefits, and services we buy. If we are not able to offset inflationary costs, our results of operations will be negatively impacted and possibly in a material manner. Any of these such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Additionally, because many of the attractions at our parks are outdoors, attendance at our parks is adversely affected by bad or extreme weather conditions and forecasts of bad or mixed weather conditions, which negatively affects our revenues and results of operations. Adverse weather events could also cause us to incur significant costs to repair or replace rides or facilities and cause extended closure times if rides or facilities have to be replaced. In addition, our costs and the time to repair and replace rides has increased due to recent supply chain disruptions. Natural disasters and adverse weather conditions can be caused or exacerbated by climate change, and the series of extreme weather events experienced in recent years presents an alarming trend. For example, attendance at our parks in 2022 was negatively impacted by Hurricane Ian which led to closures at our parks in Florida and Virginia for a combined 15 operating days. Separately, we have previously also experienced negative impacts from weather events in other parks, particularly hurricanes and severe storms, which have caused park closures and other weather impacts at our parks in Texas, California and Pennsylvania. If we fail to hire and/or retain employees, our business may be adversely affected. Our success depends in part upon a number of employees, including members of our senior management team who have extensive experience in the industry, as well as our ability to attract, train, motivate and retain qualified employees to keep pace with our needs, including employees with certain specialized skills in the field of animal training and care. We also employ a significant seasonal and part-time workforce which is critical to staffing our parks during peak periods. We recruit year-round to fill thousands of part time and seasonal staffing positions each season and work to manage wages and the timing of the hiring process in an attempt to ensure the appropriate workforce is in place; however, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in the future. During 2022 and 2021, in part due to the overall labor market, including wage inflationary pressures and the challenging current operating environment, which at times includes COVID-19 related factors, we have faced increased turnover throughout the company and challenges in meeting our staffing goals. These staffing challenges have also led to wage pressures and less than optimal staffing levels, which have impacted and could continue to impact our ability to open some of our food and beverage and retail outlets, caused us to temporarily close some rides or attractions, and/or caused longer wait times in certain areas of our parks, which has and could continue to impact the guest experience. Despite the staffing challenges we have encountered, which at times have included maintenance, security and/or animal care personnel, we have not and will not compromise the safety of our guests, ambassadors or animals. If we are unable to attract and retain adequate numbers of employees to staff our parks especially during peak periods, this could materially adversely affect our business and negatively impact our results of operations and the guest experience as it could 25 impact the number of venues, rides and/or attractions we can open. See also, “ Increased labor costs and employee health and welfare benefits may negatively impact our operations. ” Competition for employees is intense and the labor market is experiencing significant shortages, which has impacted, and has continued to impact, our ability to attract, recruit and retain both qualified senior executives as well as employees for our parks and our headquarters. Many competitors or other businesses in the markets in which we operate have increased wages and/or offered enhanced benefit packages which in some cases may be superior to ours. We have been and could continue to be unable to retain employees or to attract other highly qualified employees, particularly if we do not offer employment terms that are competitive with the rest of the current market and/or provide sufficient incentives to retain our existing and future employees. Also, if we fail to maintain a culture that makes our company an attractive place to work, employee morale may be diminished and we may have difficulty retaining our workforce and recruiting new employees. Separately, minimum wage legislation impacts some of our markets which adds additional pressure to our starting wages and increases the possibility of compression which may lead to the departure of experienced personnel. We have experienced and may continue to experience turnover of key management and executive personnel and at times we have had delays or difficulty in recruiting and hiring for these positions. In addition, we may not have an effective succession plan for some of our key leadership roles. Turnover of personnel, timing or the extent of turnover activity, failure to attract, motivate and retain our employees, or failure to develop and implement a viable succession plan for our senior management, could adversely affect our business, our ability to grow and maintain our business and our future success. Changes in our management team and/or to the Board of Directors may be disruptive to, or cause uncertainty in, our business, and any additional changes to the management team or the Board of Directors could have a negative impact on our ability to manage and grow our business effectively. Any disruption or uncertainty or difficulty in efficiently and effectively filling key management roles or maintaining and growing our workforce could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and/or the price of our common stock. Increased labor costs and employee health and welfare benefit costs may negatively impact our operations. Labor is a primary component in the cost of operating our business. We devote significant resources to recruiting and training our employees to meet our staffing needs. Increased labor costs or turnover due to competition, inflationary pressures, increased minimum wage or employee benefit costs or otherwise, has and could continue to put pressure on our margins and adversely impact our operating expenses. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 and the amendments thereto contain provisions that have impacted our healthcare costs. Additionally, the current administration is encouraging Congress to increase the federal minimum wage more broadly to $15.00 an hour in the private sector. Any future amendments or new legislation could significantly increase our compensation costs, which would reduce our net income and adversely affect our cash flows. In 2016, San Diego passed legislation which, after the first increase on January 1, 2017, increased its minimum wage over a five-year period to $15.00. Beginning on January 1, 2023 San Diego’s minimum wage was based on the consumer price index and increased to $16.30 per hour. Virginia passed legislation that increased the state minimum wage to $9.50 an hour on May 1, 2021 and increases its minimum wage to $15.00 an hour by 2026. In November 2020, Florida passed a ballot initiative raising minimum wage to $10.00 per hour effective September 30, 2021. Each September 30 th thereafter, minimum wage shall increase by $1.00 per hour until the minimum wage reaches $15.00 per hour on September 30, 2026. From that point forward, future minimum wage increases shall revert to being adjusted annually for inflation starting September 30, 2027. In addition, a number of companies with whom we compete for talent have announced wage and benefit increases to attract and retain employees in a tight labor market which has driven-up labor costs. Increases to the minimum wage in locations where we do business, wages of companies from whom we compete for talent and/or increased benefit costs will negatively impact our operating expenses. See also “ If we fail to hire and/or retain employees, our business may be adversely affected”. We are subject to complex federal and state regulations governing the treatment of animals, which can change, and to claims and lawsuits by activist groups before government regulators and in the courts. We operate in a complex and evolving regulatory environment and are subject to various federal and state statutes and regulations and international treaties implemented by federal law. The states in which we operate also regulate zoological activity involving the import and export of exotic and native wildlife, endangered and/or otherwise protected species, zoological display and anti-cruelty statutes. We incur significant compliance costs in connection with these regulations and violation of such regulations could subject us to fines and penalties and result in the loss of our licenses and permits, which, if occurred, could impact our ability to display certain animals. Future amendments to existing statutes, regulations and treaties or new statutes, regulations and treaties or lawsuits against the Company, government agencies or other third parties in the zoological industry may potentially restrict our ability to maintain our animals, or to acquire new ones to supplement or sustain our breeding programs or otherwise adversely affect our business. 26 In 2016, the California Orca Protection Act was enacted into law and (i) codified the end of captive breeding programs and the export and import of genetic materials for orcas in California, (ii) prohibits the import or export of new orcas into or existing orcas out of California, (iii) permits the transfer of orcas currently in California among existing SeaWorld facilities and (iv) requires educational presentations of orcas in California. We introduced new orca programs which are consistent with these standards in our SeaWorld San Diego park in 2017, and the SeaWorld Orlando and SeaWorld San Antonio parks in 2020. On July 26, 2022, U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) introduced the Strengthening Welfare in Marine Settings Act of 2022 (SWIMS Act). This bill would establish prohibitions on capturing, importing, exporting, or breeding of orcas, beluga whales, false killer whales, or pilot whales for the purpose of public display. The bill would prohibit the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration from issuing any permit under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 that authorizes the taking (e.g., capturing) or importation of such orcas or whales for the purpose of public display. The bill would revise the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 to make it unlawful to export such orcas or whales, unless they are being transported to marine mammal sanctuaries or for release into the wild. Further, the bill would make it unlawful under the Animal Welfare Act for any person to breed or artificially inseminate such marine mammals for purposes of using their progeny for public display. On August 2, 2022, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) introduced an identical version of the SWIMS Act in the U.S. Senate. No hearings or consideration of the bill was scheduled in the House or Senate before the 117th Congress adjourned on January 3, 2023. To date, the bill has not been reintroduced in the 118th Congress. There can be no assurance that Congress will not pass legislation, or other federal, state or local jurisdictions will not propose or enact similar laws or regulations that could materially impact the Company in the future. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”) has proposed regulations that could impact our business. See the further discussion of APHIS and other proposed regulations under “ Recent Regulatory Developments ” in the “ Business ” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In light of the uncertain legal, legislative and regulatory environment and evolving public sentiment, we continue to evaluate a broad spectrum of enhancements, modifications and alternatives with respect to the display, husbandry and breeding practices, handling and care, and study and research of our animals. Any decisions regarding such matters are subject to consideration and assessment of various factors including, but not limited to, the health and welfare of the animals, guest sentiment, market conditions, anticipated impact on our business, regulatory environment, legal proceedings, and input from our conservation partners, and other factors. If we were to pursue or be required to pursue any alternative approaches with respect to the display, husbandry and breeding practices, handling and care, or study and research of our orcas or other animals in our zoological collection, the full impact of such alternatives on our business will not be known until such alternatives are finalized. In the meantime, we continue to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate the impact of and ensure compliance with the applicable regulatory and other developments. We are subject to scrutiny by activist and other third-party groups and/or media who can pressure governmental agencies, vendors, partners, guests and/or regulators, bring action in the courts or create negative publicity about us. From time to time, animal activist and other third-party groups may make claims before government agencies, bring lawsuits against us, attempt to generate negative publicity associated with our business and/or attempt to influence guests to avoid our parks. Such activities sometimes are based on allegations that we do not properly care for some of our animals. On other occasions, such activities are specifically designed to change existing law or enact new law in order to impede our ability to retain, exhibit, acquire or breed animals. While we seek to structure our operations to comply with all applicable federal and state laws and vigorously defend ourselves when sued, there are no assurances as to the outcome of claims and lawsuits that could be brought against us or new laws or changes to existing laws that could negatively impact us. Even if not successful, these lawsuits, or proposed changes to laws, can require deployment of our resources and can lead to negative publicity. Negative publicity created by activists or in the media could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. At times, activists and other third-party groups have also attempted to generate negative publicity related to our relationships with our business partners, such as corporate sponsors, promotional partners, vendors, ticket resellers and others. These activities have at times led relationships with some ticket resellers to be terminated. Although sales from any particular ticket reseller may not constitute a significant portion of our ticket sales, if a relationship with a ticket reseller is terminated, we will attempt to find alternative distribution channels. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful or that those channels will be as successful or not have additional costs. If we are unable to find cost effective alternative distribution channels, the loss of multiple ticket resellers could have a negative impact on our results of operations. 27 Incidents or adverse publicity concerning our theme parks, the theme park industry or zoological facilities generally could harm our brands or reputation as well as negatively impact our revenues and profitability. Our brands and our reputation are among our most important assets. Our ability to attract and retain guests depends, in part, upon the external perceptions of the Company, the quality and safety of our theme parks and services and our corporate and management integrity. The operation of theme parks involves the risk of accidents, illnesses, disruptive guest behavior, environmental incidents and other incidents which may negatively affect the perception of guest and employee safety, health, security and guest satisfaction and which could negatively impact our brands or reputation and our business and results of operations. An accident or an injury at any of our theme parks or at theme parks operated by competitors, particularly an accident or an injury involving the safety of guests and employees, that receives media attention, is the topic of a book, film, documentary or is otherwise the subject of public discussions, may harm our brands or reputation, cause a loss of consumer confidence in the Company, reduce attendance at our theme parks and negatively impact our results of operations. Additionally, incidents could occur in our theme parks which may negatively affect the perception and reaction to our practices concerning certain inclusion and diversity matters. An incident involving our employees and/or our park guests which receives media attention or is otherwise the subject of public and/or social media discussions may negatively impact our results of operations. Furthermore, third-party groups may use these incidents to make claims against us and/or attempt to influence guests to avoid our parks. Such incidents have occurred in the past and may occur in the future. In addition, other types of adverse publicity concerning our business, the theme park industry or zoological facilities generally could harm our brands, reputation, and results of operations. The considerable expansion in the use of social media over recent years has compounded the impact of negative publicity. A significant portion of our revenues are historically generated in the States of Florida, California and Virginia. Any risks affecting such markets, such as natural disasters, severe weather and travel-related disruptions or incidents, may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Approximately 57%, 17% and 13% of our revenues in 2022 were generated in the States of Florida, California and Virginia, respectively. Any risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, such as the occurrence of natural disasters and travel-related disruptions or incidents, affecting the States of Florida, California and Virginia generally may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, especially if they have the effect of decreasing attendance at our theme parks or, in extreme cases, cause us to close any of our theme parks for any period of time. For example, in 2022, Hurricane Ian led to closures at our parks in Florida and Virginia for a combined 15 operating days which unfavorably impacted our attendance. Also, our parks in Texas have previously been negatively impacted by hurricanes. Although we attempt to manage our exposure to such events by implementing our hurricane preparedness plan, our theme parks located in Orlando and Tampa, Florida and in Williamsburg, Virginia have previously experienced closures as a result of storms, which negatively impacted attendance and results of operations. Furthermore, changing climate conditions could add to the frequency and severity of natural disasters and create additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures. Technology interruptions or failures that impair access to our websites or information technology systems could adversely affect our business or operations. The satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our web sites and our infrastructure are critical to the conduct of our business. Any system interruptions that result in the unavailability or slowness of our websites could impact our ability to market or sell admissions or other products which could adversely affect our results of operations and/or result in negative publicity. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, temporary system interruptions for a variety of reasons, including security incidents, viruses, telecommunication and other network failures, power failures, programming errors, undetected bugs, design faults, data corruption, denial-of-service attacks, legacy systems, poor scalability or network overload from an overwhelming number of traffic trying to reach our websites at the same time. Even a disruption as brief as a few minutes could have a negative impact on our online activities and could result in a loss of revenue. For example, there have been instances when our websites experienced slow performance and unavailability for some guests. Although these issues were short-lived and did not have a material impact to our results of operations, prolonged or repeat system interruptions and network failures could adversely impact our operations as a significant portion of our admissions revenues are from ticket purchases and reservations made online. Additionally, damage, failures or interruptions to our information technology systems may require a significant investment to update, remediate or replace with alternate systems, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations as a result. In addition, costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations and/or result in negative publicity. Any material interruptions or failures in our systems, including those that may result from our failure to adequately develop, implement and maintain a robust disaster recovery plan and backup systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance. For example, there have been instances of third-party vendors upgrading to newer versions of software which are no longer compatible with our legacy systems. 28 Cyber security risks and the failure to maintain the integrity of internal or guest data could result in damages to our reputation, the disruption of operations and/or subject us to costs, fines or lawsuits. We collect internal and customer data for business purposes. This data may include personal identifiable information held in our various information technology systems which collect, process, summarize, and report such data. We also maintain personally identifiable information about our employees. The integrity and protection of our customer, employee and company data is critical to our business. Our guests and employees have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information. The regulatory environment, as well as the requirements imposed on us by the credit card industry, governing information, security and privacy laws is increasingly demanding and continues to evolve. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act took effect in January 2020 and imposes requirements for identifying, managing, securing, tracking, producing and deleting consumer privacy information in California. Maintaining compliance with applicable security and privacy regulations may increase our operating costs and/or adversely impact our ability to market our theme parks, products, and services to our guests. We also rely on accounting, financial and operational management information technology systems to conduct our operations. If these information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. We, along with our third party service providers, face security threats, including but not limited to cyber security attacks on our data infrastructure. Like other public companies, our computer systems are regularly subject to and will continue to be the target of computer viruses, malware or other malicious codes (including ransomware), unauthorized access, cyber-attacks or other computer-related penetrations. We expect to continue devoting significant resources to the security of our information technology systems and the training of our employees and we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate technological threats. There can be no assurance that these procedures, investments and/or controls, nor those of our third party service providers, will be sufficient to prevent penetrations, malicious acts or disruptions to our systems. Furthermore, a penetrated or compromised data system or the intentional, inadvertent or negligent release or disclosure of data could result in theft, loss, fraudulent or unlawful use of guest, employee, company or protected data which could harm our reputation or result in remedial and other costs, fines or lawsuits and require significant management attention and resources to be spent. In addition, our insurance coverage and indemnification arrangements that we enter into, if any, may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to cyber security attacks or disruptions resulting from such events. To date, cyber security attacks directed at us have not had a material impact on our financial results. Due to the evolving nature of security threats, however, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted. Because we operate in a competitive industry, our revenues, profits or market share could be harmed if we are unable to compete effectively. Our theme parks compete with other theme, water and amusement parks and with other types of recreational facilities and forms of entertainment, including movies, home entertainment options, family entertainment centers, sports attractions, restaurants and vacation travel. Principal direct competitors of our theme parks include theme parks operated by The Walt Disney Company, Universal Parks and Resorts, Six Flags Entertainment Corporation, Cedar Fair, L.P., Merlin Entertainments ltd., Herschend Family Entertainment and Hershey Entertainment and Resorts Company. The principal competitive factors of a theme park include location, price, originality and perceived quality of the rides and attractions, the atmosphere and cleanliness of the theme park, the quality of its food, entertainment and employees, weather conditions, ease of travel to the theme park (including direct flights by major airlines), and availability and cost of transportation to a theme park. Certain of our direct competitors have substantially greater financial resources than we do, and they may be able to adapt more quickly to changes in guest preferences or devote greater resources to their attractions or promotion of their offerings and attractions than us. Our competitors may be able to attract guests to their theme parks in lieu of our own through the development or acquisition of new rides, attractions or shows that are perceived by guests to be of a higher quality and entertainment value. As a result, we may not be able to compete successfully against such competitors. If we are unable to compete with new and existing attractions, our results of operations could be negatively impacted. Featuring animals at our theme parks involves risks. Our theme parks feature numerous displays and interactions that include animals. All animal enterprises involve some degree of risk. All animal interactions by our employees and our guests in attractions in our theme parks, where offered, involve risk. While we maintain strict safety procedures for the protection of our guests, employees and the animals in our care, injuries or death, while rare, have occurred in the past. For example, in February 2010, a trainer was killed while engaged in an interaction with an orca. Following this incident, we were subject to an inspection by the Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), which resulted in citations concerning alleged violations of the Occupational Safety and Health Act and certain regulations thereunder. In connection with this incident, we reviewed and revised our safety protocols and made certain safety-related facility enhancements such as revising training protocols used in animal presentations. This incident has also been and continues to be the subject of significant media attention, including extensive television and newspaper coverage, books, at least one documentary and discussions in social media. This incident and similar events that may occur in the future may harm our reputation, reduce attendance 29 and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. See also, “ Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that we could suffer, and our insurance costs may increase."" Animals in our care are important to our theme parks, and they could be exposed to infectious diseases. Many of our theme parks are distinguished from those of our competitors in that we offer guest interactions with animals in our care. Individual animals, specific species of animals or groups of animals in our zoological collection could be exposed to infectious diseases or could expose guests to infectious diseases. An outbreak of an infectious disease among any animals in our theme parks or the public’s perception that a certain disease could be harmful to human health may materially adversely affect our zoological collection, our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, outbreaks and/or illnesses in our zoological collection could impact the availability of certain guest experiences. The high fixed cost structure of theme park operations can result in significantly lower margins if revenues decline or we are unable to offset price increases. A large portion of our expenses is relatively fixed because the costs for employees, maintenance, animal care, utilities, property taxes and insurance do not vary significantly with attendance. These fixed costs may increase at a greater rate than our revenues especially during inflationary periods and may not be able to be reduced at the same rate as declining revenues. For example, our costs of food, merchandise and other sources of revenues are influenced by inflation and fluctuations in global commodity prices. If cost-cutting efforts are insufficient to offset increased costs or declines in revenues or are impracticable, we could experience a material decline in margins, revenues, profitability and reduced or negative cash flows. Such effects can be especially pronounced during pandemics such as was seen during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 or periods of inflation or economic contraction or slow economic growth. Our operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations. We have historically experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in our annual theme park attendance and revenue, which are typically higher in our second and third quarters, partly because seven of our theme parks were historically only open for a portion of the year. As a result, approximately two-thirds of our attendance and revenues were historically generated in the second and third quarters of the year and we generally incurred a net loss in the first and fourth quarters. In addition, the timing of school vacations and school start dates also cause fluctuations in our quarterly theme park attendance and revenue. For example, revenues can shift between the first and second quarters due to the timing of Easter and spring break holidays and between the first and fourth quarters due to the timing of holiday breaks around Christmas and New Year. Even for our theme parks that have historically been open year-round, attendance patterns have significant seasonality, driven by holidays, school vacations and weather conditions. Changes in school calendars that impact traditional school vacation breaks could also impact attendance patterns. The operating season at some of our theme parks, including SeaWorld San Antonio, Aquatica San Antonio, Adventure Island, Busch Gardens Williamsburg, Water Country USA, Sesame Place Philadelphia and our former Aquatica San Diego park (rebranded as Sesame Place San Diego in 2022), has historically been of limited duration. Any changes to the operating schedule of a park such as increasing operating days for our seasonal parks, could change the impact of seasonality in the future. During 2021, we began year-round operations at SeaWorld San Antonio and began to operate on select days on a year round basis at both Busch Gardens Williamsburg and Sesame Place in Pennsylvania. Additionally, in March 2022, we opened our Sesame Place San Diego park which has been, and is expected to continue to be, open more operating days than the Aquatica San Diego park it replaced, particularly in the first and fourth quarters of the year. When conditions or events described in this Risk Factors section occur during the operating season, particularly during the second and third quarters, there is only a limited period of time during which the impact of those conditions or events can be mitigated. Accordingly, such conditions or events may have a disproportionately adverse effect on our revenues and cash flow. In addition, historically most of our expenses for maintenance and costs of adding new attractions at our seasonal theme parks are incurred when the operating season is over, which may increase the need for borrowing to fund those expenses during such periods. Changes in consumer tastes and preferences for entertainment and consumer products could reduce demand for our entertainment offerings and products and adversely affect the profitability of our business. The success of our business depends on our ability to consistently provide, maintain, and expand theme park attractions as well as create online material and consumer products that meet changing consumer preferences . In addition, consumers from outside the United States constitute an important portion of our theme park attendance, and our success depends in part on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to tastes and preferences of this consumer group. If our entertainment offerings and products do not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or if consumer preferences change, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. 30 We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which could adversely affect our ability to report our results of operations and financial condition accurately and in a timely manner. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Our management is likewise required, on a quarterly basis, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and to disclose any changes and material weaknesses identified through such evaluation in those internal controls. As described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, a material weakness in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting still exists which was initially disclosed as of September 30, 2021. Management and our Board of Directors are committed to remediating the material weakness to address the deficiency within the control environment which resulted from a lack of sufficient policies and procedures surrounding the frequency, manner and extent in which Board members engage with management, resulting, in part, from increased Board engagement with management. Based upon a recommendation of the Audit Committee of the Board, the Board formed a committee (the “Committee”) and engaged independent consultants to advise the Committee and management as it relates to this deficiency to develop and execute on a remediation plan. Management has performed an initial risk assessment to address this deficiency. As a result of this assessment, management and the Committee have identified actions to remediate the material weakness. Management will continue to perform ongoing risk assessment procedures, including continued enhancement, design and implementation of relevant controls, and will assess and test the effectiveness of these remediation efforts. The material weakness cannot be considered remediated, however, until remediation efforts have operated for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, that the material weakness has been resolved. Although we will continue to assess the effectiveness of our remediation efforts in connection with our evaluations of internal control over financial reporting, these efforts can only be accomplished over time, and these initiatives may not accomplish their intended effects. See the further discussion of increased Board engagement with management under “ Current Operating Environment ” in the “ Business ” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As a result, if the material weakness we have identified is not remediated effectively or in a sufficient amount time, we could be impacted by a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements that was not prevented or detected in a timely basis, which could have a negative effect on our results of operations and/or the trading price of our securities. Furthermore, we could also be subject to one or more investigations or enforcement actions by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, stockholder lawsuits or other adverse actions requiring us to incur defense costs, pay fines, settlements or judgments, thereby causing investor perceptions to be adversely affected. Additionally, failure to maintain our internal control over financial reporting could adversely impact our ability to report our financial position and results from operations on a timely and accurate basis. If our financial statements are not accurate, investors may not have a complete understanding of our operations. Likewise, if our financial statements are not filed on a timely basis, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our shares are listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business and/or we may not be able to maintain compliance with certain of our debt agreements. Moreover, failure to timely file our financial statements could cause us to be ineligible to utilize short form registration statements, which could impair our ability to obtain capital in a timely fashion to execute our business strategies or issue shares to effect an acquisition. Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities. Our growth strategy may not achieve the anticipated results. Our future success will depend on our ability to grow our business, including through capital investments to improve existing and develop or acquire additional theme parks, rides, attractions and shows, as well as in-park product offerings and product offerings outside of our theme parks that are complementary to our parks. Our growth and innovation strategies require significant commitments of management resources and capital investments and may not grow our revenues at the rate we expect or at all. As a result, we may not be able to recover the costs incurred in developing our new projects and initiatives or to realize their intended or projected benefits, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We may not be able to fund theme park capital expenditures and investment in future attractions and projects. A principal competitive factor for a theme park is the originality and perceived quality of its rides and attractions. We need to make continued capital investments through maintenance and the regular addition of new rides and attractions. Our ability to fund capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and to raise capital from third parties. We cannot assure you that our operations will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to fund such costs, or that we will be able to obtain sufficient financing on adequate terms, or at all, which could cause us to delay or abandon certain projects or plans. 31 We may not realize the benefits of developments, restructurings, acquisitions or other strategic initiatives and we may incur significant costs associated with such activities. Our business strategy may include selective expansion, both domestically and internationally, through acquisitions of assets or other strategic initiatives, such as joint ventures, that allow us to profitably expand our business and leverage our brands. For example, in 2016 we announced our partnership with Miral Asset Management LLC to develop SeaWorld Abu Dhabi, a first-of-its-kind marine life themed park on Yas Island, which is expected to open later in 2023. There is no assurance that the Miral partnership or our other strategic initiatives will be successful. Any international transactions and partnerships are subject to additional risks, including foreign and U.S. regulations on the import and export of animals, the impact of economic fluctuations in economies outside of the United States, difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations due to distance, language and cultural differences, as well as political instability and lesser degree of legal protection in certain jurisdictions, currency exchange fluctuations and potentially adverse tax consequences of overseas operations. In addition, the success of any acquisition depends on effective integration of acquired businesses and assets into our operations, which is subject to risks and uncertainties, including realization of anticipated synergies and cost savings, the ability to retain and attract personnel, the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns, and undisclosed or potential legal liabilities of acquired businesses or assets. We are continuing our efforts to identify cost reductions and efficiency opportunities as well as incremental pricing and revenue opportunities to help offset recent inflationary pressures relating to the costs for labor, goods, services and capital projects. There is no assurance that we will be able to achieve and/or sustain the cost savings, realize or sustain operational efficiencies or achieve other benefits that we may initially expect. In addition, such actions may result in various one-time costs and temporary operational inefficiencies and could negatively impact business, guest experiences and employment relationships during transitional periods. See further discussion under the caption “ Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations―Principal Factors and Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations―Costs and Expenses ” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our business and could adversely affect our results of operations, and/or various other factors beyond our control could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly evolved around the globe, with many countries, at various times, taking meaningful measures to limit the spread of the virus by instituting quarantines or lockdowns, imposing travel restrictions and vaccination mandates for certain workers or activities and limiting operations of certain non-essential businesses. While restrictions have eased and the global economy has largely re-opened, many medical and public health experts believe that COVID-19 could perpetually reoccur for years, such as seasonally in winter, and even if generally ceasing to be fatal for most people, such reoccurrence could increase the possibility of periods of increased restrictions on business operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted global commercial activity and has contributed to significant economic, financial, and other disruptions. Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 continued to be impacted by the global COVID-19 pandemic due in part to a decline in both international and group-related attendance from historical levels. Additionally, our results of operations for 2021 and 2020 were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic due in part to capacity limitations, modified/limited operations and/or temporary park closures which were in place for portions of the respective periods, as well as decreased demand due to public concerns associated with the pandemic, and severe restrictions on international travel. In 2022 and 2021, the global economy, with certain setbacks, began reopening, and wider distribution of vaccines has encouraged greater economic activity. While vaccine availability and uptake has increased, the longer-term macro-economic effects of the pandemic continue to impact the theme park industry and the financial turmoil and other changes associated with the pandemic may have lasting eﬀects on our business and operations. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic, along with other geopolitical and economic factors, continues to disrupt global supply chains, has caused labor shortages and has added broad inflationary pressures. It is impossible to predict the severity and future transmission rates of COVID-19, the impact of any mutations of the virus, the extent and effectiveness of any vaccine or containment actions taken, and the potential impact of these and other factors on travel and consumer behavior. Any continued restrictions on travel, quarantines and other measures imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as ongoing concern regarding the virus’ potential impact and mutations and spikes in the number of infections, have had and will likely continue to have a negative effect on economies, financial markets and our business, including supply chain shortages; staffing challenges for us, our suppliers and those that support the travel industry; and additional business disruptions. Any such impacts could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may face additional costs and obstacles in complying with any new federal, state or local regulations or industry best practices established in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, hiring and retaining employees and attracting guests who may not wish to travel or visit our theme parks for a prolonged period. In addition, any measures we take or may be required to take such as limiting capacity in our theme parks, enforcing social distancing requirements and/or requiring facial coverings or vaccinations may negatively impact attendance at our theme parks. 32 If we do not continue to respond appropriately to the pandemic, or if customers do not perceive our response to be adequate, we could suffer damage to our reputation, which could significantly adversely affect our business. Furthermore, the effects of the pandemic on our business could be long-lasting and could continue to have adverse effects, some of which may be significant, and which may indefinitely impact our ability to operate our business in the traditional, pre-pandemic manner. Our properties are subject to the risk that operations could be halted for a temporary or extended period of time. If there is a prolonged disruption at any of our properties, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects will likely be materially adversely affected. Additionally, if a prolonged downturn of general economic or other conditions in the areas in which our properties are located or from which we draw our guests or prevents guests from easily coming to our properties, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects will be materially adversely affected. Adverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved in the normal course of our business could reduce our profits or limit our ability to operate our business. We are subject to allegations, claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business, which may include claims by third parties, including guests who visit our theme parks, our employees, vendors, stockholders and/or regulators. We are currently subject to securities litigation and other disputes. We are also subject to audits, inspections and investigations by, or receives requests for information from, various federal and state regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”), the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“Cal-OSHA”), state departments of labor, the Florida Fish & Wildlife Commission (“FWC”), the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”), the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS” ), the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). From time to time, various parties may also bring lawsuits against us. For example, on February 11, 2020, we announced that we had entered into a settlement agreement with respect to a previously disclosed class action lawsuit commenced in 2014, captioned Baker v. SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc ., et al., Case No. 14-CV-02129-MMA (AGS) (“Baker”). The settlement required us to pay $65.0 million for claims alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as the costs of administration and legal fees and expenses. The settlement does not include or constitute an admission, concession, or finding of any fault, liability, or wrongdoing by us or any defendant. Also, in September 2018, we reached a settlement with the SEC relating to a previously disclosed SEC investigation. In connection with the settlement, without admitting or denying the substantive allegations in the SEC’s complaint, we agreed to the entry of a final judgment ordering us to pay a civil penalty of $4.0 million and enjoining us from violation of certain provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and certain rules thereunder. We discuss securities litigation and other litigation to which we are subject in greater detail in “ Item 3. Legal Proceedings ” and Note 15–Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any proceedings, audits, inspections or investigations were to be determined adversely against us or resulted in legal actions, claims, regulatory proceedings, enforcement actions, or judgments, fines, or settlements involving a payment of material sums of money, or if injunctive relief were issued against us, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Even the successful defense of legal proceedings may cause us to incur substantial legal costs and may divert management’s attention and resources. Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could adversely affect our business. Our intellectual property, including our trademarks, service marks, domain names, copyrights, patent and other proprietary rights, constitutes a significant part of our value. To protect our intellectual property rights, we rely upon a combination of trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret and unfair competition laws of the United States and other countries, as well as contract provisions and third-party policies and procedures governing internet/domain name registrations. However, there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful in any given case, particularly in those countries where the laws do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. We may be unable to prevent the misappropriation, infringement or violation of our intellectual property rights, breaching any contractual obligations to us, or independently developing intellectual property that is similar to ours, any of which could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed, adversely affect our revenues or otherwise harm our business. We have obtained and applied for numerous U.S. and foreign trademark and service mark registrations and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks and service marks or other intellectual property, as appropriate. We cannot guarantee that any of our pending applications will be approved by the applicable governmental authorities. Moreover, even if the applications are approved, third parties may seek to oppose or otherwise challenge these registrations. A failure to obtain registrations for our intellectual property in the United States and other countries could limit our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and impede our marketing efforts in those jurisdictions. 33 We are actively engaged in enforcement and other activities to protect our intellectual property rights. If it became necessary for us to resort to litigation to protect these rights, any proceedings could be burdensome, costly and divert the attention of our personnel, and we may not prevail. In addition, any repeal or weakening of laws or enforcement in the United States or internationally intended to protect intellectual property rights could make it more difficult for us to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, negatively impacting their value and increasing the cost of enforcing our rights. We may be subject to claims for infringing the intellectual property rights of others, which could be costly and result in the loss of significant intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that we do not and will not infringe the intellectual property rights of others. We have been in the past, and may be in the future, subject to litigation and other claims in the ordinary course of our business based on allegations of infringement or other violations of the intellectual property rights of others. Regardless of their merits, intellectual property claims can divert the efforts of our personnel and are often time-consuming and expensive to litigate or settle. In addition, to the extent claims against us are successful, we may have to pay substantial money damages or discontinue, modify, or rename certain products or services that are found to be in violation of another party’s rights. We may have to seek a license (if available on acceptable terms, or at all) to continue offering products and services, which may significantly increase our operating expenses. If we lose licenses and permits required to exhibit animals and/or violate laws and regulations, our business will be adversely affected. We are required to hold government licenses and permits, some of which are subject to yearly or periodic renewal, for purposes of possessing, exhibiting, and maintaining animals. Although our theme parks’ licenses and permits have always been renewed in the past, in the event that any of our licenses or permits are not renewed or any of our licenses or permits are revoked, portions of the affected theme park might not be able to remain open for purpose of displaying or retaining the animals covered by such license or permit. Such an outcome could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we are subject to periodic inspections by federal and state agencies and the subsequent issuance of inspection reports. While we believe that we comply with, or exceed, requisite care and maintenance standards that apply to our animals, government inspectors can cite us for alleged statutory or regulatory violations. In unusual instances when we are cited for an alleged deficiency, we are most often given the opportunity to correct any purported deficiencies without penalty. It is possible, however, that in some cases a federal or state regulator could seek to impose monetary fines on us. In the past, when we have been subjected to governmental claims for fines, the amounts involved were not material to our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, while unlikely, we cannot predict whether any future fines that regulators might seek to impose would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Moreover, many of the statutes under which we operate allow for the imposition of criminal sanctions. While neither of the foregoing situations are likely to occur, either could negatively affect the business, financial condition or results of operations at our theme parks. Unionization activities or labor disputes may disrupt our operations and affect our profitability. Although none of our employees are currently covered under collective bargaining agreements, we cannot guarantee that our employees will not elect to be represented by labor unions in the future. For example, in the recent past, we have experienced union organizing activities and these activities were resolved favorably. If some or all of our employees were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were significantly different from our current compensation arrangements, however, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, a labor dispute involving some or all of our employees may disrupt our operations and reduce our revenues, and resolution of labor and employment-related disputes may increase our costs. Although we maintain binding policies that require employees to submit to a mandatory alternative dispute resolution procedure in lieu of other remedies, as employers, we may be subject to various employment-related claims, such as individual or class actions or government enforcement actions relating to alleged employment discrimination, employee classification and related withholding, wage-hour, labor standards or healthcare and benefit issues. Such actions, if brought against us and successful in whole or in part, may affect our ability to compete or materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. If we are unable to maintain certain commercial licenses, our business, reputation and brand could be adversely affected. We rely on a license from Sesame to use the Sesame Place trade name and trademark and certain other intellectual property rights, including titles, marks, characters, logos and designs from the Sesame Street television series within our Sesame Place theme park located in Langhorne, Pennsylvania (the “Langhorne Sesame Place”), the Sesame Place theme park located in Chula Vista, California (the ""San Diego Sesame Place"") and any additional future Sesame Place theme parks in the United States (collectively, the “Standalone Parks”) and with respect to Sesame Street themed areas within certain areas of some of our other theme parks, as well as in connection with the sales of certain Sesame Street themed products. The License Agreement with Sesame (the “Sesame License Agreement”) has an initial term through December 31, 2031, with an automatic additional 15-year extension plus a 5-year option added from each new Standalone Park opening. Our use of these intellectual property rights is subject to the approval of Sesame and 34 the parties have certain termination rights under the Sesame License Agreement, including without limitation Sesame’s right to terminate the Sesame License Agreement in whole or in part under certain limited circumstances, including a change of control of SeaWorld (or of SeaWorld Parks and Entertainment, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of SeaWorld), our bankruptcy or uncured breach of the Sesame License Agreement, or the termination of the Sesame License Agreement regarding the Langhorne Sesame Place and San Diego Sesame Place theme parks. If we were to lose or have to renegotiate the Sesame License Agreement, our business may be adversely affected. ABI is the owner of the Busch Gardens trademarks and domain names. ABI has granted us a perpetual, exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use the Busch Gardens trademark and certain related domain names in connection with the operation, marketing, promotion and advertising of certain of our theme parks, as well as in connection with the production, use, distribution and sale of merchandise sold in connection with such theme parks. Under the license, we are required to indemnify ABI against losses related to our use of the marks. If we were to lose or have to renegotiate this license, our business may be adversely affected. Our existing debt agreements contain, and future debt agreements may contain, restrictions that may limit our flexibility in operating our business. Our existing debt agreements contain, and documents governing our future indebtedness may contain, financial and operating covenants that limit the discretion of management with respect to certain business matters. These covenants place restrictions on, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends and other distributions, make capital expenditures, make certain loans, investments and other restricted payments, enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends, engage in certain transactions with stockholders or affiliates, sell certain assets or engage in mergers, acquisitions and other business combinations, amend or otherwise alter the terms of our indebtedness, alter the business that we conduct, guarantee indebtedness or incur other contingent obligations and create liens. Our existing debt agreements also require, and documents governing our future indebtedness may require, us to meet certain financial ratios and tests. Our ability to comply with these and other provisions of the existing debt agreements is dependent on our future performance, which will be subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control. The breach of any of these covenants or non-compliance with any of these financial ratios and tests could result in an event of default under the existing debt agreements, which, if not cured or waived, could result in acceleration of the related debt and the acceleration of debt under other instruments evidencing indebtedness that may contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions. We discuss certain key covenants and financial ratios to which we are subject under our debt agreements in greater detail under the caption “Restrictive Covenants” in Note 11–Long-Term Debt to our accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and under “ Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations―Our Indebtedness―Covenant Compliance ”. Failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds, related margins, liquidity, and access to capital markets. Moody’s Investor Service and Standard & Poor’s Financial Services routinely evaluate our debt and issue ratings on our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. These ratings are based on a number of factors, which included their assessment of our financial strength, liquidity, capital structure, asset quality, and sustainability of cash flow and earnings. Due to changes in these factors, the pandemic and market conditions, we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings, which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins, liquidity and access to capital markets. For example, as of December 31, 2022, our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and Senior Unsecured Credit Facilities were rated by Standard and Poor’s Financial Services (corporate credit rated BB- with a stable outlook, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities rated BB, and the Senior Unsecured Credit Facilities rated B) and Moody’s Investors Service (corporate family rated B1 with a stable outlook, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities rated Ba3, and the Senior Unsecured Credit Facilities rated B3). We disclose these ratings to enhance the understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effects of these ratings on our costs of funds and related margins, liquidity and access to capital markets. Our borrowing costs depend, in part, on our credit ratings and any actions taken by these credit rating agencies to lower our credit ratings, could increase our borrowing costs. Our leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness. As of December 31, 2022, our total indebtedness was approximately $2.138 billion. Our high degree of leverage could have important consequences, including the following: (i) a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations is dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available for operations, capital expenditures, future business opportunities and/or share repurchases of our common stock; (ii) our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate purposes in the future may be limited; (iii) certain of the borrowings are at variable rates of interest, which will increase our vulnerability to increases in interest rates; (iv) we are at a competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors; (v) we may be unable to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions; (vi) the debt service requirements of our other indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations; and (vii) we 35 may be vulnerable in a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business and we may be unable to carry out activities that are important to our growth. During 2021 and 2022, the United States experienced increasing inflation. Increased inflation is likely to cause interest rates (including LIBOR and SOFR) to increase. For example, in 2022, in light of increasing inflation, the Federal Reserve increased interest rates seven times. The Federal Reserve has indicated that it expects continued increases in interest rates in 2023 and 2024. Any further increase could increase our borrowing costs on variable debt and adversely affect our business. We do not currently have any of our debt hedged. A hypothetical increase in LIBOR of 100 bps would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $11.9 million. Increased debt service costs would adversely affect our cash flow and net income. There can be no assurance that if we intend to enter into a hedge, that we will be able to enter into hedging arrangements on favorable terms or at all. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, or to pay interest on, or to refinance indebtedness depends on and is subject to our financial and operating performance, which in turn is affected by general and regional economic, financial, competitive, business and other factors beyond our control, including the availability of financing in the banking and capital markets. If unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs, we will need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity. There can be no assurance that any refinancing of our indebtedness will be possible and any such refinancing could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants that could further restrict our business operations. We from time to time may increase the amount of our indebtedness, modify the terms of our financing arrangements, make capital expenditures, issue dividends and take other actions that may substantially increase our leverage. Despite our significant leverage, we may incur additional amounts of debt, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our significant leverage. Hill Path Capital LP and its affiliates could be able to significantly influence our decisions and their interests may conflict with ours or yours in the future. In 2019, Hill Path Capital LP and certain of its affiliates (“Hill Path”) purchased in the aggregate, 13,214,000 shares of our common stock (the “HP Purchase”). As described more fully in our Form 8-K dated May 27, 2019, we concurrently entered into the Stockholders Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement and the Undertaking Agreement (collectively, the “HP Agreements”) with Hill Path in connection with the HP Purchase. On July 7, 2020, Hill Path filed with the SEC a Schedule 13D/A (the “Schedule 13D/A”) reporting that such persons had accumulated a total of 27,205,306 shares of our common stock, which represents approximately 42.6% of our total outstanding shares of common stock as of December 31, 2022. Also, certain funds affiliated with Hill Path have other economic interests in the Company. Please refer to their most recent Schedule 13D/A filed on November 14, 2022. In addition, the Hill Path Schedule 13D filed on May 1, 2017, as amended states, among other things, that Hill Path may suggest changes in our business, operations, capital structure, capital allocation, corporate governance, and other strategic matters. Under the HP Agreements, we agreed to appoint up to three Hill Path director designees (“Hill Path Designees”) to our Board of Directors of which two directors may be affiliated with Hill Path and, subject to the independence standards of the New York Stock Exchange, there must be one Hill Path Designee on each committee of the Board, as determined by Hill Path and subject to the approval of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Scott Ross, founder of Hill Path and James Chambers, a Partner at Hill Path are the Hill Path Designees. Mr. Ross currently serves as Chairman of the Board and Chairman of the Compensation Committee and also serves on the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Revenue Committee. Mr. Chambers serves as Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and also serves on the Compensation Committee and the Revenue Committee. For so long as Hill Path Designees remain on our Board, Hill Path will have influence with respect to our management, business plans and policies, including the appointment and removal of our officers, and nominees for director. In addition, for so long as Hill Path continues to own a significant percentage of our stock, Hill Path will be able to influence the composition of our Board of Directors and the approval of actions requiring stockholder approval. For example, for so long as Hill Path continues to own a significant percentage of our stock, Hill Path may be able to influence whether or not a change of control of our Company or a change in the composition of our Board of Directors occurs. The concentration of ownership could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of common stock as part of a sale of our Company and ultimately might affect the market price of our common stock. 36 Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that we could suffer, and our insurance costs may increase. Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that we could suffer, and our insurance costs may increase. Although we maintain various safety and loss prevention programs and carry property and casualty insurance to cover certain risks, our insurance policies do not cover all types of losses and liabilities. Additionally, many of our policies are subject to deductibles and/or self-insured retentions and co-insurance. There can be no assurance our insurance will be sufficient to cover the full extent of all losses or liabilities for which we are insured and may be significantly less than the expected and actual replacement cost of rebuilding facilities “as was” if there was a total loss. For example, our losses in 2020 related to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic were not covered by insurance available to us. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew our current insurance policies on favorable terms, or at all. In addition, if we or other theme park operators sustain significant losses or make significant insurance claims, then our ability to obtain future insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates could be materially adversely affected. We may be unable to purchase or contract with third-party manufacturers for our theme park rides and attractions, or construction and/or supply chain delays may occur and impact attraction openings. We may be unable to purchase or contract with third parties to build high quality rides and attractions and to continue to service and maintain those rides and attractions at competitive or beneficial prices, or to provide the replacement parts needed to maintain the operation of such rides. The costs of fuel, construction, repairs and maintenance, labor, freight and utilities are all subject to inflationary pressures that have recently increased the costs of building and maintaining our rides and attractions. Furthermore, global supply chain issues have, and could continue to, cause delays in the receipt of required goods or services which could negatively impact ride availability. In addition, if our third-party suppliers’ financial condition deteriorates or they go out of business, we may not be able to obtain the full benefit of manufacturer warranties or indemnities typically contained in our contracts or may need to incur greater costs for the maintenance, repair, replacement or insurance of these assets. We have incurred and may in the future incur unanticipated construction delays in completing capital projects which could adversely affect ride or attraction opening dates which could impact our attendance or revenues. Further, when rides and/or attractions have downtime and/or closures, our guest experience, attendance or revenue could be adversely affected. Our operations and our ownership of property subject us to environmental requirements, and to environmental expenditures and liabilities. We incur costs to comply with environmental requirements, such as those relating to water use, wastewater and storm water management and disposal, air emissions control, hazardous materials management, solid and hazardous waste disposal, and the clean-up of properties affected by regulated materials. We have been required and continue to investigate and clean-up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases, and other releases, from current or formerly owned or operated facilities. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we generate, use and dispose of large volumes of water, including saltwater, which requires us to comply with a number of federal, state and local regulations and to incur significant expenses. Failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to fines and penalties and/or require us to incur additional expenses. Although we are not now classified as a large quantity generator of hazardous waste, we do store and handle hazardous materials to operate and maintain our equipment and facilities and have done so historically. We cannot assure you that we will not incur substantial costs to comply with new or expanded environmental requirements in the future or to investigate or clean-up new or newly identified environmental conditions, which could also impair our ability to use or transfer the affected properties and to obtain financing. Delays, restrictions, or inability to obtain or maintain permits for capital investments could impair our business. Our capital investments require regulatory permits from one or more governmental agencies in order to improve existing or build new theme parks, rides, attractions and shows. Such permits are typically issued by state agencies, but federal and local governmental permits may also be required. The requirements for such permits vary depending on the location of such capital investments. As with all governmental permitting processes, there is a degree of uncertainty as to whether a permit will be granted, the time it will take for a permit to be issued, and the conditions that may be imposed in connection with the granting of the permit. Therefore, our capital investments in certain areas may be delayed, interrupted, or suspended for varying lengths of time, causing a loss of revenue to us, increasing cost, and/or adversely affecting our results of operations. 37 Financial distress experienced by our strategic partners or other counterparties could have an adverse impact on us. We are party to numerous contracts of varying durations. Certain of our agreements are comprised of a mixture of firm and non-firm commitments, varying tenures, and varying renewal terms, among other terms. There can be no guarantee that, upon the expiration of our contracts, we will be able to renew such contracts on terms as favorable to us, or at all. Although we attempt to assess the creditworthiness of our strategic partners and other contract counterparties, there can be no assurance as to the creditworthiness of any such strategic partner or contract counterparty. Financial distress experienced by our strategic partners or other counterparties could have an adverse impact in the event such parties are unable to pay us for the services we provide or otherwise fulfill their contractual obligations. We are exposed to the risk of loss in the event of non-performance by such strategic partners or other counterparties. Some of these counterparties may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating, market and regulatory risks, and some are experiencing, or may experience in the future, severe financial problems that have had or may have a significant impact on their creditworthiness. In addition, the sale or transfer of our common stock owned by affiliates of Hill Path, or the perception that such sales or transfers could occur, could harm the prevailing market price of shares of our common stock. Any material nonpayment or nonperformance from our contract counterparties due to inability or unwillingness to perform or adhere to contractual arrangements could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to make cash distributions to our stockholders. Furthermore, in the case of financially distressed strategic partners, such events might otherwise force such strategic partners to curtail their commercial relationships with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. Tariffs or other trade restrictions could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We purchase some of our merchandise for resale and other products used in our business from entities which are located in foreign countries. Additionally, some of our ride manufacturers may be located in foreign countries or utilize components manufactured or sourced from foreign countries. These relationships expose us to risks associated with doing business globally, including changes in tariffs, quotas and other restrictions on imports (collectively “Trade Restrictions”) as well as escalating global trade tensions and the potential for international supply chain disruptions due to geopolitical events. The United States has increased tariffs on certain imports from China and other countries. Such Trade Restrictions have resulted in increased costs and could result in lower gross margin on impacted products and/or will likely result in increases in the cost of capital projects, unless we are able to successfully take any one or more of the following mitigating actions: increase our prices, move production to countries with no or lower tariffs or away from domestic vendors who source from China or other tariff impacted countries, or alter or cease offering certain products. Any increase in pricing, alteration of products or reduced product offering could reduce the competitiveness of our products. Furthermore, any retaliatory counter-measures imposed by countries subject to such tariffs could increase our, or our vendors’, import expenses. Additionally, even if the products we import are not directly impacted by tariffs, the imposition and maintenance of such tariffs on goods imported into the United States could cause increased prices for consumer goods, in general, which could have a negative impact on consumer spending for discretionary items reducing attendance or spending at our parks. These direct and indirect impacts of increased tariffs or Trade Restrictions implemented by the United States, both individually and cumulatively, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of future operations. Actions of activist stockholders, and such activism could adversely impact the value of our securities. We value constructive input from our stockholders and the investment community. Our Board and management team are committed to acting in the best interests of all of our stockholders. There is no assurance that the actions taken by our Board and management in seeking to maintain constructive engagement with our stockholders will be successful. Responding to actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management and our employees. Such activities could also interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plan and our long-term growth. The perceived uncertainties as to our future direction caused by activist actions could affect the market price of our securities, result in the loss of potential business opportunities and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, board members and business partners. In addition, any interference with our annual meeting process, including but not limited to a proxy contest for the election of directors at our annual meeting, could require us to incur significant legal and other advisory fees and proxy solicitation expenses and require significant time and attention by management and our Board. 38 The policies of the U.S. President and his administration or any changes to tax laws may result in a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial condition and may impact our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards. While we cannot predict the changes that the current administration will make, certain policy changes regarding increases in minimum wage, limitation or restrictions on travel to the United States, foreign trade barriers, domestic travel rules, changes to labor laws or regulations, and/or changes to environmental or animal welfare regulations could adversely affect our business. Additionally, policies that strengthen the U.S. dollar against a variety of foreign currencies could impact international tourist spending, including at our theme parks. While there is currently a substantial lack of clarity and uncertainty around the likelihood, timing and details of any such policies and reforms, such policies and reforms may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the value of our securities. The President signed an Executive Order with the goal of increasing the minimum wage for federal workers and contractors to $15.00 an hour, which became effective January 30, 2022. Additionally, the current administration is encouraging Congress to increase the federal minimum wage more broadly to $15.00 an hour in the private sector. Separately, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), which was enacted on December 22, 2017, contained a number of changes to U.S. federal tax laws. The Tax Act, among other changes, imposed limitations on the deductibility of interest. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) of 2022 was signed into law. This legislation includes a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax and a 1% excise tax on stock repurchases among its key tax provisions effective for years beginning after December 31, 2022. While we do not anticipate the IRA having a material impact on our operations, there can be no guarantee that this will be the case. The relationship between the United States and foreign countries could impact consumers’ willingness to spend discretionary income, the availability and/or cost of goods, the availability of international flights, and/or the ability or desire of foreign tourists to visit the United States. Additional guidance may be issued by the Internal Revenue Service (""IRS""), the Department of the Treasury, or other governing body that may significantly differ from our interpretation of the law. In addition, our future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by changes in tax rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, the effectiveness of current and future tax planning strategies or changes in tax laws. Such factors may result in a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial conditions . We continue to monitor changes and proposed changes to tax and other laws that may impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition and liquidity. It is currently unclear how the agenda of the current administration will impact our business. Changes to, or the elimination of, LIBOR may adversely affect interest expense related to our indebtedness. Borrowings under our Term B Loan which mature on August 25, 2028, and the Revolving Credit Facility which matures on August 25, 2026 are currently based on LIBOR. In March 2021, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), a regulator of financial services firms and financial markets in the United Kingdom, announced that it will phase out of regulatory oversight of LIBOR interest rates indices. The FCA has indicated it will support the LIBOR indices for USD LIBOR through June 2023, to allow for an orderly transition to an alternative reference rate. The FCA announcement coincides with the March 2021 announcement of LIBOR’s administrator, the ICE Benchmark Administration (“IBA”) , indicating that, as a result of not having access to input data necessary to calculate LIBOR after June 30, 2023, the IBA would have to cease publication of such LIBOR tenors immediately after the last publication on June 30, 2023. Further, in March 2022, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2022, which includes the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act, was signed into law in the U.S. This legislation establishes a uniform benchmark replacement process for financial contracts maturing after June 30, 2023 that do not contain clearly defined or practicable fallback provisions. The legislation also creates a safe harbor that shields lenders from litigation if they choose to utilize a replacement rate recommended by the Federal Reserve. The United States Federal Reserve has also advised banks to cease entering into new contracts that use USD LIBOR as a reference rate. There is no assurance that dates announced by the FCA will not change or that the administrator of LIBOR and/or regulators will not take further action that could impact the availability, composition, or characteristics of LIBOR or the currencies and/or tenors for which LIBOR is published. If LIBOR ceases to exist and the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes ensues, there are no guarantees whether the composition or characteristics of any such alternative, successor or replacement reference rate will be similar to, or produce the same value or economic equivalence of, the LIBOR Rate or have the same volume or liquidity as did the London interbank offered rate prior to its discontinuance or unavailability. Also, if we intend to hedge our LIBOR denominated debt, we cannot predict whether hedging opportunities will exist on acceptable terms. 39 The Alternative Reference Rates Committee, which was charged with determining a replacement for LIBOR, has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), as the recommended risk-free alternative rate for LIBOR. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2018-16, Derivatives and Hedging which includes SOFR as a permitted rate that can be used in the application of hedge accounting pursuant to adoption of the standard. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing SOFR rates in April 2018. SOFR is intended to be a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities. The market transition away from LIBOR is expected to be complicated, and to include the development of term and credit adjustments with a fallback rate to accommodate differences between LIBOR and SOFR. There can be no guarantee that SOFR will become widely used or that alternatives may be developed without additional complications. We are not able to predict whether LIBOR will cease to be available after 2023, whether SOFR will become a widely accepted benchmark in place of LIBOR, or what the impact of such a possible transition from LIBOR may be on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock Our stock price may change significantly, and you may not be able to sell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid or at all, and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result. The trading price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile. Since shares of our common stock were sold in our IPO in April 2013 through December 31, 2022, our common stock close price has ranged from $7.46 to $74.44. In addition to the risk factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the trading price of our common stock may be adversely affected due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: 40 We cannot guarantee that our allocation of capital to various alternatives will enhance long-term stockholder value, and in some cases, our Share Repurchase Program could increase the volatility of the price of our common stock. Our goal is to invest capital to maximize our overall long-term returns. This includes spending on capital projects and expenses, managing debt levels, and periodically returning capital to our stockholders through share repurchases and/or dividends. There can be no assurance that our capital allocation decisions will enhance stockholder value. Our Board has previously authorized a share repurchase of up to $250.0 million of our common stock (the “Share Repurchase Program”), of which approximately $56.4 million remained available under the Share Repurchase Program as of December 31, 2022. The number of shares to be purchased and the timing of purchases will be based on our trading windows and available liquidity, general business and market conditions and other factors, including legal requirements and alternative opportunities. The IRA, which was passed in August 2022, contains a 1% excise tax on share repurchases, which may impact our future decisions on how to return value to shareholders in the most tax efficient manner and would increase the cost of share repurchases. During 2022, we completed share repurchases of 12,423,497 shares for an aggregate total of approximately $693.6 million. Repurchases of our common stock pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. The existence of the Share Repurchase Program could cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. There can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock. Although the Share Repurchase Program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, there is no assurance that it will do so and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce such program’s effectiveness. See Note 19–Stockholders’ Deficit in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Future sales, or the perception of future sales, by us or our existing stockholders in the public market could cause the market price for our common stock to decline. The sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could harm the prevailing market price of shares of our common stock. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. Shares held by Hill Path and certain of our directors, officers and employees are eligible for resale, subject to volume, manner of sale and other limitations under Rule 144. In addition, pursuant to a registration rights agreement entered into in connection with the HP Purchase, we granted Hill Path the right, subject to certain conditions, to require us to register the sale of their shares of common stock under the Securities Act. If Hill Path exercises their registration rights, the market price of our shares of common stock could drop significantly. This factor could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through future offerings of our shares of common stock or other securities. In addition, the shares of our common stock reserved for future issuance under the 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan will become eligible for sale in the public market once those shares are issued, subject to provisions relating to various vesting agreements, any applicable lock-up agreements in effect from time to time and Rule 144, as applicable. A total of 15,000,000 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under the 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan, of which approximately 7,290,000 shares of common stock remain available for future issuance as of December 31, 2022. In the future, we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions. The number of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of our common stock. Any issuance of additional securities in connection with investments or acquisitions may result in additional dilution to you. Our indebtedness could limit our ability to make restricted payments such as share repurchases and/or pay dividends on our common stock in the future. Our ability to make restricted payments such as share repurchases and/or declare dividends is limited by covenants in our senior secured credit facilities pursuant to a credit agreement dated as of August 25, 2021, as the same may be amended, restated, supplemented or modified from time to time (the “Senior Secured Credit Facilities”). We have not paid a dividend since September 2016. Dividends, if any, and the timing of declaration of any such dividends, will be at the discretion of the Board and will depend upon many factors, including, but not limited to, our results of operations, financial condition, level of indebtedness, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, restrictions in our debt agreements and in any preferred stock, business prospects and other factors that the Board deems relevant. See Note 11–Long-Term Debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 41 Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control. Certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, defer or prevent a merger, acquisition, tender offer, takeover attempt or other change of control transaction that a stockholder might consider in its best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by our stockholders. These provisions provide for, among other things: These anti-takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if the third-party’s offer may be considered beneficial by many of our stockholders. As a result, our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares. The concentration of ownership of our capital stock limits your ability to influence corporate matters. Our executive officers, directors, current 5% or greater stockholders and entities affiliated with them beneficially owned (as determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC) approximately 57.5% of our common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2022. This significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with controlling stockholders. Also, these stockholders, acting together, may be able to control our management and affairs and matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions, such as mergers, consolidations or the sale of substantially all of our assets. Consequently, this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, including a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control, even if that change of control would benefit our other stockholders. Non-U.S. holders who own or owned more than a certain ownership threshold may be subject to United States federal income tax on gains realized on the disposition of our common stock. We believe that we are currently a U.S. real property holding corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. So long as our common stock continues to be regularly traded on an established securities market, a non-U.S. stockholder who holds or held (at any time during the shorter of the five-year period preceding the date of disposition or the holder’s holding period) more than 5% of our common stock will be subject to United States federal income tax on the disposition of our common stock. Non-U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the consequences of disposing of shares of our common stock. 42 Item 1B. Unresolv ed Staff Comments None. Item 2. P roperties The following table summarizes our principal properties as of December 31, 2022, which includes approximately 400 acres of land available for future development.

Lease Agreement with City of San Diego Our subsidiary, Sea World LLC (f/k/a Sea World Inc.), leases approximately 190 acres from the City of San Diego, including approximately 17 acres of water in Mission Bay Park, California (the “Premises”). The current lease term commenced on July 1, 1998 and extends for 50 years or the maximum period allowed by law. Under the lease, the Premises must be used as a marine park facility and related uses. In addition, we may not operate another marine park facility within a radius of 560 miles from the City of San Diego. The annual rent under the lease is calculated on the basis of a specified percentage of Sea World LLC’s gross income from the Premises (the “Percentage Rent”), or the minimum yearly rent (the “Minimum Rent”), whichever is greater. The minimum yearly rent which was approximately $10.4 million for the each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, is adjusted every three years to an amount equal to 80% of the average accounting year rent actually paid for the three previous years. The Company is awaiting the City of San Diego’s confirmation of the new adjusted minimum yearly rent, which will be effective as of January 1, 2023. The Company’s gross income from the Premises was significantly impacted during the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the temporary park closures, limited reopenings, modified operations and capacity restrictions resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related government restrictions in San Diego. As a result, the Company deferred approximately $1.6 million of the Percentage Rent related to the year ended December 31, 2020, which was subsequently paid during the first quarter of 2021. The Company continues to defer payment of an additional $8.3 million related to the Minimum Rent for the year ended December 31, 2020, which is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses as of December 31, 2022.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations References to our “theme parks” or “parks” in the discussion that follows includes all of our separately gated parks. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those described in the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. You should carefully read “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Introduction The following discussion and analysis is intended to facilitate an understanding of our business and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto in the “ Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The discussion which follows consists of the following sections: Management’s discussion and analysis relating to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 and the applicable year-to-year comparisons to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K but can be found in “ Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 , which specific discussion is incorporated herein by reference. Business Overview We are a leading theme park and entertainment company providing experiences that matter and inspiring guests to protect animals and the wild wonders of our world. We own or license a portfolio of recognized brands, including SeaWorld, Busch Gardens, Aquatica, Discovery Cove and Sesame Place. Over our more than 60-year history, we have developed a diversified portfolio of 12 differentiated theme parks that are grouped in key markets across the United States. Many of our theme parks showcase our one-of-a-kind zoological collection and feature a diverse array of both thrill and family-friendly rides, educational presentations, shows and/or other attractions with broad demographic appeal which deliver memorable experiences and a strong value proposition for our guests. Recent Developments See the discussion under “ Recent Developments ” in the “ Business ” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which includes a discussion relating to the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic on our business. For other factors concerning the current operating environment and the COVID-19 pandemic, see the “ Risk Factors ” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “ The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our business and could adversely affect our results of operations and/or various other factors beyond our control could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations ”, and “ If we fail to hire and/or retain employees, our business may be adversely affected ”. Regulatory Developments See the discussion of relevant regulatory developments under “ Recent Regulatory Developments ” in the “ Business ” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a discussion of certain risks associated with federal and state regulations governing the treatment of animals, see the “ Risk Factors ” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “ Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry—We are subject to complex federal and state regulations governing the treatment of animals, which can change, and to claims and lawsuits by activist groups before government regulators and in the courts. ” 46 Principal Factors and Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations Revenues Our revenues are driven primarily by attendance in our theme parks and the level of per capita spending for admission and per capita spending for food and beverage, merchandise and other in-park products. We define attendance as the number of guest visits. Attendance drives admissions revenue as well as total in-park spending. Admissions revenue primarily consists of single-day tickets, annual passes (which generally expire after a 12-month term), season passes (including our fun card products and, collectively with annual passes, referred to as “passes” or “season passes”) or other multi-day or multi-park admission products. Revenue from these admissions products are generally recognized based on attendance. Certain pass products are purchased through monthly installment arrangements which allow guests to pay over the product’s initial commitment period. Once the initial commitment period is reached, some of these products transition to a month-to-month basis providing these guests access to specific parks on a monthly basis with related revenue recognized monthly, while others can renew for a full commitment period. Total revenue per capita, defined as total revenue divided by total attendance, consists of admission per capita and in-park per capita spending: Total revenue per capita, admissions per capita and in-park per capita spending are key performance metrics that we use to assess the operating performance of our parks on a per attendee basis and to make strategic operating decisions. We believe the presentation of these performance metrics is useful and relevant for investors as it provides investors the ability to review operating performance in the same manner as our management and provides investors with a consistent methodology to analyze revenue between periods on a per attendee basis. In addition, investors, lenders, financial analysts and rating agencies have historically used similar per-capita related performance metrics to evaluate companies in the industry. See further discussion in the “ Results of Operations ” section which follows and in Note 2–Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For other factors affecting our revenues, see the “ Risk Factors ” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Attendance The level of attendance in our theme parks is generally a function of many factors, including affordability, the opening of new attractions and shows, competitive offerings, weather, marketing and sales efforts, awareness and type of ticket and park offerings, travel patterns of both our domestic and international guests, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and global and regional economic conditions, consumer confidence, the external perceptions of our brands and reputation, industry best practices and perceptions as to safety. The external perceptions of our brands and reputation have at times impacted relationships with some of our business partners, including certain ticket resellers that have terminated relationships with us and other zoological-themed attractions. We believe the level of attendance in our theme parks, including the mix of attendance from certain markets and certain guests has been and/or could be impacted by public concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of reported local cases of COVID-19, domestic and international travel restrictions, federal, state and local regulations related to public places, limits on social gatherings, the availability and/or effectiveness of vaccines, boosters and/or medications for adults and children, and overall public safety sentiment. We continuously monitor factors impacting our attendance, making strategic operations, marketing and sales adjustments as necessary. 47 As approved vaccines and/or boosters continue to be distributed, the operating environment has improved and COVID-19 related capacity limitations have been eliminated; however, there can be no certainty of the extent and effectiveness of the vaccines and/or boosters or how they will impact these factors and others, including domestic or international travel, group events and group-related attendance, public opinion concerning social gatherings, consumer behavior or federal, state and local regulations related to health protocols, capacity limitations and social gatherings. See the “ Risk Factors ” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. See discussion on seasonality of our attendance in the “ Seasonality ” section which follows. Costs and Expenses Historically, the principal costs of our operations are employee wages and benefits, driven partly by staffing levels, advertising, maintenance, animal care, utilities, property taxes and insurance. Factors that affect our costs and expenses include fixed operating costs, competitive wage pressures including minimum wage legislation, commodity prices, costs for construction, repairs and maintenance, park operating hours, new parks and/or incremental operating days, new and/or enhanced events, attendance levels, supply chain issues, and inflationary pressures, among other factors. The mix of products sold compared to the prior year period can also impact our costs as retail products generally have a higher cost of sales component than our food and beverage or other in-park offerings. We have a dedicated team of employees and consultants focused on reducing costs and improving operating margins and streamlining our labor structure to better align with our strategic business objectives. We have spent significant time reviewing our operations and have identified meaningful cost savings opportunities, including technology initiatives, which we believe will further strengthen our business and, in some instances, improve guest experiences. For other factors affecting our costs and expenses, see “ Current Operating Environment ” in the “Business” section and the “ Risk Factors ” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We make annual investments to support and improve our existing theme park facilities and attractions. Maintaining and improving our theme parks, as well as opening new attractions, is critical to remain competitive, grow revenue, and increase our guests’ length of stay. For further discussion of our new and planned attractions, see “ Capital Improvements ” in the “Business” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Seasonality The theme park industry is seasonal in nature. Historically, we generate the highest revenues in the second and third quarters of each year, in part because seven of our theme parks were historically only open for a portion of the year. As a result, approximately two-thirds of our attendance and revenues were historically generated in the second and third quarters of the year and we generally incurred a net loss in the first and fourth quarters. The percent mix of revenues by quarter is relatively constant each year, but revenues can shift between the first and second quarters due to the timing of Easter and spring break holidays and between the first and fourth quarters due to the timing of holiday breaks around Christmas and New Year. Even for our theme parks which have historically been open year-round, attendance patterns have significant seasonality, driven by holidays, school vacations and weather conditions. Changes in school calendars that impact traditional school vacation breaks and/or start dates could also impact attendance patterns. Any changes to the operating schedule of a park such as increasing operating days for our historically seasonal parks, could change the impact of seasonality in the future. In the year ended December 31, 2022, we opened our Sesame Place San Diego park which has been, and is expected to continue to be, open more operating days than the Aquatica San Diego park it replaced, particularly in the first and fourth quarters of the year. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2021, we began year-round operations at our SeaWorld park in Texas and began to strategically add additional operating days at both our Busch Gardens park in Virginia and our Sesame Place park in Pennsylvania. Incremental operating days generally are expected to drive incremental attendance and revenue. See “ Risk Factors” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial performance. 48 Results of Operations The following discussion provides an analysis of our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Our results for the year ended December 31, 2022 are not directly comparable to the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to COVID-19 related impacts including a temporary park closure and capacity limitations at some of our parks in 2021. See "" Business "", "" Risk Factors "" and “ Attendance ” sections included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 The following data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following table presents key operating and financial information for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: For the Year Ended December 31, Variance 2022 2021 # % Selected Statements of Comprehensive Net Income Data: (In thousands, except per capita data and %) Net revenues: Admissions $ 965,232 $ 851,891 $ 113,341 13.3 % Food, merchandise and other 766,005 651,839 114,166 17.5 % Total revenues 1,731,237 1,503,730 227,507 15.1 % Costs and expenses: Cost of food, merchandise and other revenues 135,217 114,287 20,930 18.3 % Operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below) 735,687 622,419 113,268 18.2 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 200,074 184,871 15,203 8.2 % Severance and other separation costs 108 1,531 (1,423 ) (92.9 %) Depreciation and amortization 152,620 148,660 3,960 2.7 % Total costs and expenses 1,223,706 1,071,768 151,938 14.2 % Operating income 507,531 431,962 75,569 17.5 % Other expense, net (43 ) 144 (187 ) NM Interest expense 117,501 116,642 859 0.7 % Loss on early extinguishment of debt and write-off of discounts and debt issuance costs — 58,827 (58,827 ) NM Income before income taxes 390,073 256,349 133,724 52.2 % Provision for (benefit from) income taxes 98,883 (164 ) 99,047 NM Net income $ 291,190 $ 256,513 $ 34,677 13.5 % Other data: Attendance 21,939 20,203 1,736 8.6 % Total revenue per capita $ 78.91 $ 74.43 $ 4.48 6.0 % Admission per capita $ 44.00 $ 42.17 $ 1.83 4.3 % In-park per capita spending $ 34.91 $ 32.26 $ 2.65 8.2 % NM-Not meaningful Admissions revenue . Admissions revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased $113.3 million, or 13.3%, to $965.2 million as compared to $851.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The improvement was a result of an increase in attendance of 1.7 million guests, or 8.6%, and an increase in admission per capita. Attendance benefitted primarily from an increase in demand predominantly resulting from a return to more normalized operations when compared to 2021, which included COVID-19 related impacts including limited operating days, a temporary park closure, capacity limitations at some of our parks and more severe restrictions on international travel. Attendance during 2022 was also unfavorably impacted by adverse weather. We estimate that adverse weather, including the impact of Hurricanes Ian and Nicole, contributed to a decline of approximately 655,000 guests during the year. Admission per capita increased by 4.3% to $44.00 in 2022 compared to $42.17 in 2021. Admission per capita increased primarily due to the realization of higher prices in our admission products resulting from our strategic pricing efforts, which was partially offset by the net impact of the admissions product mix when compared to 2021. 49 Food, merchandise and other revenue . Food, merchandise and other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased $114.2 million, or 17.5% to $766.0 million as compared to $651.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase results from improved in-park per capita spending along with the increase in attendance discussed above. In-park per capita spending increased by 8.2%, to $34.91 in 2022 from $32.26 in 2021. In park per capita spending improved due to a combination of factors including, pricing initiatives, improved product quality and mix and the impact of new, enhanced and/or expanded in-park offerings when compared to 2021. In-park per capita spending was also unfavorably impacted by less than optimal staffing during certain times of the year, which impacted our ability to fully operate and/or open some of our food and beverage and retail outlets. Costs of food, merchandise and other revenues. Costs of food, merchandise and other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased $20.9 million, or 18.3%, to $135.2 million as compared to $114.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase primarily relates to inflationary pressures along with the increase in attendance as discussed above. These costs represent 17.7% and 17.5% of related revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase as a percent of related revenue partly relates to the impact of inflationary pressures which were partially offset by higher realized prices on some of our in-park products and the impact of sourcing cost savings initiatives. Operating expenses . Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased by $113.3 million, or 18.2% to $735.7 million as compared to $622.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Operating expenses in 2021 were impacted by limited operating days, a temporary park closure and capacity limitations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, the increase in operating expenses in 2022 primarily results from an increase in labor-related costs and other operating costs due to a return to more normalized operations and an increase in attendance. Operating expenses were also impacted by inflationary pressures, partially offset by the impact of structural cost savings initiatives when compared to 2021. Operating expenses as a percent of revenue were 42.5% for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 41.4% for the year ended December 31, 2021. Selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased by $15.2 million, or 8.2% to $200.1 million as compared to $184.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase is primarily due to increased marketing-related costs and increased third-party consulting costs, partially offset by a decrease in non-cash equity compensation expense and the impact of cost savings and efficiency initiatives. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue were 11.6% for the year ended December 31, 2022 and 12.3% for the year ended December 31, 2021. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased by $4.0 million, or 2.7% to $152.6 million as compared to $148.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase primarily relates to new asset additions partially offset by the impact of asset retirements and fully depreciated assets. Interest expense. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased $0.9 million, or 0.7% to $117.5 million as compared to $116.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase primarily relates to increased interest rates on variable rate debt, partially offset by the net impact of a lower average outstanding balance on our variable debt and lower interest on fixed debt as a result of the Refinancing Transactions. See Note 11–Long-Term Debt to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the “ Our Indebtedness ” section which follows for further details. Loss on early extinguishment of debt and write-off of discounts and debt issuance costs. Loss on early extinguishment of debt and write-off of discounts and debt issuance costs for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily relate to a write-off of discounts and debt issuance costs resulting from the Refinancing Transactions during the year ended December 31, 2021. See Note 11–Long-Term Debt to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K and the “ Our Indebtedness” section which follows for further details. Provision for (benefit from) income taxes. Provision for income taxes was $98.9 million compared to a benefit from income taxes of $0.2 million in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our consolidated effective tax rate was 25.3% for 2022 compared to -0.1% for 2021. The effective tax rate increased primarily due to non-cash valuation allowance adjustments on federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and federal tax credits during 2021, along with changes in state tax rates and impacts from equity-based compensation. See Note 13–Income Taxes in our notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. 50 Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Generally, our principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations, funds from borrowings and existing cash on hand. Our principal uses of cash typically include the funding of working capital obligations, debt service, investments in theme parks (including capital projects), share repurchases and/or other return of capital to stockholders, when permitted. As of December 31, 2022, we had a working capital ratio (defined as current assets divided by current liabilities) of 0.6. We typically have operated with a working capital ratio of less than 1 due to significant deferred revenue balance from revenues paid in advance for our theme park admissions products and high turnover of in-park products that result in limited inventory balances. Our cash flow from operations, along with our revolving credit facilities, have historically allowed us to meet our liquidity needs. As market conditions warrant and subject to our contractual restrictions and liquidity position, we or our affiliates may from time to time purchase our outstanding equity and/or debt securities, including our outstanding bank loans in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Any such purchases may be funded by incurring new debt, including additional borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Any new debt may also be secured debt. We may also use available cash on our balance sheet. The amounts involved in any such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. Further, since some of our debt may trade at a discount to the face amount among current or future syndicate members, any such purchases may result in our acquiring and retiring a substantial amount of any particular series, with the attendant reduction in the trading liquidity of any such series. Depending on conditions in the credit and capital markets and other factors, we will, from time to time, consider other financing transactions, the proceeds of which could be used to refinance our indebtedness or for other purposes. Share Repurchases See Note 19–Stockholders’ Deficit in our notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on the Company's share repurchase programs. Other We believe that existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet the capital expenditures, debt service obligations, and working capital requirements of our operations for at least the next 12 months. The following table presents a summary of our cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 564,588 $ 503,012 $ (120,729 ) Net cash used in investing activities (200,705 ) (128,854 ) (109,175 ) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (726,049 ) (364,897 ) 624,204 Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash $ (362,166 ) $ 9,261 $ 394,300 Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $564.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to $503.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. Net cash provided by operating activities was primarily impacted by improved operating performance, including increased sales of admission and other products. Net cash provided by operating activities was $503.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to net cash used in operating activities of $120.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities was primarily impacted by improved operating performance, including increased sales of admission and other products, partially offset by the impact of increased interest payments in the year ended December 31, 2021 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, which was impacted by the temporary park closures. 51 Cash Flows from Investing Activities Investing activities consist principally of capital investments we make in our theme parks for future attractions and infrastructure. Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2022 consisted of capital expenditures of $200.7 million largely related to future attractions (see further breakdown of capital expenditures in the table below). Net cash used in investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 consisted of capital expenditures of $128.9 million and $109.2 million, respectively. The following table presents detail of our capital expenditures for the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Capital Expenditures: (Unaudited, in thousands) Core (a) $ 137,370 $ 69,402 $ 94,671 Expansion/ROI projects (b) 63,335 59,452 14,504 Capital expenditures, total $ 200,705 $ 128,854 $ 109,175 The amount of our capital expenditures may be affected by general economic and financial conditions, among other things, including restrictions imposed by our borrowing arrangements. We generally expect to fund our capital expenditures through our operating cash flow. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which materially impacted our operating cash flow in 2020, we took proactive measures starting in March 2020 relating to our capital expenditures including delaying the opening of certain new rides to 2022 which were originally scheduled to open in 2020. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2022 results primarily from $693.6 million used to repurchase shares and the payment of tax withholdings on equity-based compensation through shares withheld of $22.5 million. Net cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 results primarily from $215.7 million used to repurchase shares, net debt repayments of $133.8 million, which includes the Refinancing Transactions and payments on the Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes, and the payment of tax withholdings on equity-based compensation through shares withheld of $14.5 million. The Refinancing Transactions primarily consisted of $1,934.6 million in repayments of our then outstanding Term B-5 Loans and Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes, approximately $34.3 million related to a premium paid for redemption of our Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes, and approximately $23.3 million in debt issuance costs partially offset by net proceeds from our Term B Loans and the Senior Notes of $1,922.2 million. Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 results primarily from net proceeds from our First-Priority Senior Secured Notes and our Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes offering of $713.7 million, partially offset by net repayments on our revolving credit facility of $50.0 million, repayments of $15.5 million on our long-term debt, $12.4 million used to repurchase shares early in the first quarter of 2020 and $7.5 million of debt issuance costs paid in connection with the issuance of the First-Priority Senior Secured Notes and Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes, and as a result of amendments to our senior secured credit facilities. See Note 11–Long-Term Debt and Note 19–Stockholders' Deficit to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. Our Indebtedness We are a holding company and conduct our operations through our subsidiaries, which have incurred or guaranteed indebtedness as described below. As of December 31, 2022, our indebtedness consisted of senior secured credit facilities, 8.75% first-priority senior secured notes (the “First-Priority Senior Secured Notes”) and 5.25% senior notes due 2029 (the “Senior Notes”). See discussion which follows and Note 11–Long-Term Debt to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details related to our indebtedness and related debt transactions. Senior Secured Credit Facilities SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc. (“SEA”) is the borrower under the senior secured credit facilities, as amended and restated pursuant to a credit agreement (the “Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”) dated August 25, 2021 (the “Senior Secured Credit Facilities”). 52 As of December 31, 2022, our Senior Secured Credit Facilities consisted of $1.185 billion in Term B Loans, which will mature in August 2028, along with a $390.0 million Revolving Credit Facility, which had no amounts outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and will mature in August 2026. As of December 31, 2022, SEA had approximately $18.4 million of outstanding letters of credit, leaving approximately $371.6 million available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, SEA borrowed $20.0 million on the Revolving Credit Facility for general working capital purposes. Senior Notes and First-Priority Senior Secured Notes As of December 31, 2022, SEA had outstanding $725.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due on August 15, 2029 and $227.5 million in aggregate principal amount of First-Priority Senior Secured Notes, due on May 1, 2025. Covenant Compliance As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all covenants in the credit agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indentures governing our Senior Notes and First-Priority Senior Secured Notes. See Note 11–Long-Term Debt to our consolidated financial statements for further details relating to our restrictive covenants. Adjusted EBITDA We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus (i) income tax provision (benefit), (ii) loss on extinguishment of debt, (iii) interest expense, consent fees and similar financing costs, (iv) depreciation and amortization, (v) equity-based compensation expense, (vi) certain non-cash charges/credits including those related to asset disposals and self-insurance reserve adjustments, (vii) certain business optimization, development and strategic initiative costs, (viii) merger, acquisition, integration and certain investment costs, and (ix) other nonrecurring costs including incremental costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic or similar unusual events. Under the credit agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indentures governing our Senior Notes and First-Priority Senior Secured Notes (collectively, the “Debt Agreements”), our ability to engage in activities such as incurring additional indebtedness, making investments, refinancing certain indebtedness, paying dividends and entering into certain merger transactions is governed, in part, by our ability to satisfy tests based on Covenant Adjusted EBITDA as defined in the Debt Agreements (“Covenant Adjusted EBITDA”). Covenant Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Adjusted EBITDA plus certain other items as defined in the Debt Agreements, including estimated cost savings among other adjustments. Cost savings represent annualized estimated savings expected to be realized over the following 24 month period related to certain specified actions including restructurings and cost savings initiatives, net of actual benefits realized during the last twelve months. Other adjustments include (i) recruiting and retention costs, (ii) public company compliance costs, (iii) litigation and arbitration costs, and (iv) other costs and adjustments as permitted by the Debt Agreements. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate as it eliminates the effect of certain non-cash and other items not necessarily indicative of a company’s underlying operating performance. We use Adjusted EBITDA in connection with certain components of our executive compensation program. In addition, investors, lenders, financial analysts and rating agencies have historically used EBITDA related measures in our industry, along with other measures, to estimate the value of a company, to make informed investment decisions and to evaluate companies in the industry. In addition, we believe the presentation of Covenant Adjusted EBITDA for the last twelve months is appropriate as it provides additional information to investors about the calculation of, and compliance with, certain financial covenants in the Debt Agreements. See Note 11–Long-Term Debt to our consolidated financial statements for further details relating to our restrictive covenants. Adjusted EBITDA and Covenant Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for a measure of our financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and are not indicative of income or loss from operations as determined under GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA, Covenant Adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP financial measures have limitations which should be considered before using these measures to evaluate our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA and Covenant Adjusted EBITDA as presented by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to varying methods of calculation. 53 The following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA and Covenant Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) for the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (In thousands) Net income (loss) $ 291,190 $ 256,513 $ (312,321 ) Provision for (benefit from) income taxes 98,883 (164 ) (30,525 ) Loss on early extinguishment of debt and write-off of discounts and debt issuance costs (a) — 58,827 — Interest expense 117,501 116,642 100,907 Depreciation and amortization 152,620 148,660 150,546 Equity-based compensation expense (b) 19,757 41,018 7,467 Loss on impairment or disposal of assets and certain non-cash expenses (c) 14,218 7,099 7,187 Business optimization, development and strategic initiative costs (d) 19,846 8,759 7,268 Certain investment costs and other taxes 1,128 830 1,044 COVID-19 related incremental costs (e) 6,689 22,562 8,808 Other adjusting items (f) 6,413 1,302 (13,567 ) Adjusted EBITDA (g) 728,245 662,048 (73,186 ) Items added back to Covenant Adjusted EBITDA as defined in the Debt Agreements: Estimated cost savings (h) 1,600 7,100 — Other adjustments as defined in the Debt Agreements (i) 10,877 19,990 (i) Covenant Adjusted EBITDA (j) $ 740,722 $ 689,138 $ (73,186 ) For the year ended December 31, 2021, reflects business optimization, development and other strategic initiative costs primarily related to: (i) $4.2 million of third-party consulting costs; (ii) $3.1 million of other business optimization costs and strategic initiative costs and (iii) $1.5 million of severance and other separation costs associated with positions eliminated. For the year ended December 31, 2020, reflects business optimization, development and other strategic initiative costs primarily related to: (i) $3.1 million of third party consulting costs and (ii) $2.8 million of severance and other separation costs primarily related to a restructuring program in 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2021, includes approximately $11.9 million of nonrecurring contractual liabilities and legal costs impacted by the temporary COVID-19 park closures and approximately $9.0 million of incremental temporary labor-related costs incurred to prepare and staff the parks and other incremental, nonrecurring, temporary incentives paid to attract employees to return to or remain in the workforce during the COVID-19 related environment. 54 For the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily includes incremental labor-related costs to prepare and operate the parks with enhanced safety measures, incremental third-party consulting costs primarily related to our COVID-19 response and safety communication strategies, contract termination or modification costs related to impacts from the temporary COVID-19 park closures, legal costs related to COVID-19 related matters, and temporary or initial purchases of safety monitoring and personal protective equipment. These costs were included with other adjusting items in the Adjusted EBITDA calculation previously reported for the year ended December 31, 2020 and have been reclassified to COVID-19 related incremental costs above to conform with the current year presentation. For the year ended December 31, 2020, includes approximately $16.9 million of legal settlement proceeds partially offset by approximately $3.3 million in other legal fees. The legal settlement proceeds received in 2020 relate to the following: (i) $12.5 million of insurance proceeds related to a legal settlement gain as previously disclosed and (ii) $4.4 million related to the return of funds previously paid for a legal settlement. See Note 15–Commitments and Contingencies in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the estimated cost savings calculation was based on annualized estimated savings we expected to realize over the following 18-month period related to certain specified actions, including restructurings and cost savings initiatives. These estimated savings were calculated net of the amount of actual benefits realized during such period and were limited to 25% of Adjusted EBITDA, calculated for the last twelve months before the impact of these estimated cost savings. Contractual Obligations We had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2022. The following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations as of December 31, 2022: Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years (In thousands) Long-term debt (including current portion) (a) $ 2,137,500 $ 12,000 $ 251,500 $ 24,000 $ 1,850,000 Interest on long-term debt (b) 805,781 149,947 285,629 250,190 120,015 Operating and finance leases (c) 287,399 23,994 24,458 22,881 216,066 Purchase obligations, license commitments and other (d) 232,845 154,995 70,650 2,400 4,800 Total contractual obligations $ 3,463,525 $ 340,936 $ 632,237 $ 299,471 $ 2,190,881 55 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingencies during the reporting period. Significant estimates and assumptions include the valuation and useful lives of long-lived assets, the accounting for income taxes, the accounting for self-insurance and revenue recognition. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies which require management’s most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. For more discussion of these and other significant accounting policies, refer to Note 2–Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets All long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Assets are grouped and tested at the lowest level for which identifiable, independent cash flows are available. An impairment loss may be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset, including disposition, are less than the carrying value of the asset. The measurement of the impairment loss to be recognized is based upon the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying amounts of the assets. Fair value is generally determined based upon a discounted cash flow analysis. If significant, certain impairment indicators may trigger an impairment review. Accounting for Income Taxes We are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation periods for property and equipment and deferred revenue, for tax and financial accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets. We must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets (primarily net operating loss and charitable contribution carryforwards) will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent that we believe that recovery is not more likely than not, a valuation allowance against those amounts is recorded. To the extent that we record a valuation allowance or a change in the valuation allowance during a period, we recognize these amounts as income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), contains rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change, which is generally any change in ownership of more than 50% of its stock over a rolling three-year period, to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards in years after the ownership change. These rules generally operate by focusing on ownership shifts among stockholders owning directly or indirectly 5% or more of the stock of a company and any change in ownership arising from shares of stock sold by these same stockholders. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision or benefit for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets. Management has analyzed all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard in assessing the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred income tax assets. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of the statutory carryback and carryforward periods and tax planning alternatives. Forecasted financial performance is not used as evidence until such time as the Company has cumulative pretax income for a rolling 36-month period. The assumptions about future taxable income require the use of significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying business. 56 Through December 31, 2020, approximately $65.6 million of valuation allowances were established for some of our deferred tax assets, which, based on our analysis at the time, we believed did not meet the “more likely than not” criteria and would expire before being realized in future periods. Based on our assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets during the year ended December 31, 2021, which included a review of current and forecasted financial performance as the Company was in a cumulative pretax income position, we believed that some of these deferred tax assets met the “more likely than not” criteria and will be realized in future periods before they expire. As a result, we reversed our valuation allowances by approximately $60.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, we had a valuation allowance of approximately $4.8 million, net of federal tax benefit, on our deferred tax assets relating to state net operating losses, which we believed did not meet the “more likely than not” criteria and would expire before being realized in future periods. As of December 31, 2022, we have a valuation allowance of approximately $4.6 million, net of federal tax benefit, on our deferred tax assets related to state net operating loss carryforwards. Our valuation allowances, in part, rely on estimates and assumptions related to our future financial performance. Given the macroeconomic environment related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the uncertainties regarding the related impact on financial performance, our valuation allowances may need to be adjusted in the future. For further details, also refer to Note 13–Income Taxes, in our notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Self-Insurance Reserves Reserves are recorded for the estimated amounts of guest and employee claims and expenses incurred each period that are not covered by insurance. Reserves are established for both identified claims and incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) claims. Such amounts are accrued for when claim amounts become probable and estimable. Reserves for identified claims are based upon our own historical claims experience and third-party estimates of settlement costs. Reserves for IBNR claims are based upon our own claims data history, actuarially determined loss development factors and qualitative considerations such as claims management activities. All reserves are periodically reviewed for changes in facts and circumstances and adjustments are made as necessary. Revenue Recognition Admissions revenue primarily consists of single-day tickets, annual or season passes or other multi-day or multi-park admission products. Food, merchandise and other revenue primarily consists of food and beverage, retail, merchandise and other in-park products and also includes other miscellaneous revenue, which is not significant in the periods presented. For single-day tickets, we recognize revenue at a point in time, upon admission to the park, and for food and beverage, retail, merchandise and other in-park products we recognize revenue when the related products or services are received by our guests. For annual or season passes and multi-use admission products, revenue is deferred and recognized over the terms of the admission product based on estimated redemption rates for similar products and is adjusted periodically. We estimate redemption rates using historical and forecasted attendance trends by park for similar products. Attendance trends factor in seasonality and are adjusted based on actual trends periodically. These estimated redemption rates impact the timing of when revenue is recognized on these products. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates based on actual attendance patterns. Revenue is recognized on a pro-rata basis based on the estimated allocated selling price of the admission product. For pass products purchased on an installment plan that have met their initial commitment period and have transitioned to a month to month basis, monthly charges are recognized as revenue when payments are received each month, with the exception of payments received during the temporary park closures in 2020. For multi-day admission products, revenue is allocated based on the number of visits included in the pass and recognized ratably based on each admission into the theme park. Certain admission products may also include bundled products at the time of purchase, such as food and beverage or merchandise items. We conduct an analysis of bundled products to identify separate distinct performance obligations that are material in the context of the contract. For those products that are determined to be distinct performance obligations and material in the context of the contract, we allocate a portion of the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation using each performance obligation’s standalone price. If the bundled product is related to a pass product and offered over time, revenue will be recognized over time accordingly. For further details, also refer to Note 4–Revenues, in our notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 57 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualita tive Disclosures about Market Risk Inflation The impact of inflation has affected, and will continue to affect, our operations significantly. Our costs of food, merchandise and other revenues are influenced by inflation and fluctuations in global commodity prices. In addition, other costs such as costs of fuel, construction, repairs and maintenance, labor, freight, utilities and insurance are all subject to inflationary pressures. For further discussion, see the “ Risk Factors ” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates, and to a lesser extent on currency exchange rates, from time to time, on imported rides and equipment. The objective of our financial risk management is to reduce the potential negative impact of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to acceptable levels. We do not acquire market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes. Prior to 2021, we previously managed interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed-rate long-term debt and interest rate swaps that fixed a portion of our variable-rate long-term debt. In May 2020, our interest rate swap agreements expired, as such, we did not have any derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2022, 2021 or 2020. We presently manage interest rate risk primarily by managing the amount, sources and duration of our debt funding. At December 31, 2022, approximately $1.2 billion of our outstanding long-term debt represents variable-rate debt. Assuming an average balance on our revolving credit borrowings of approximately $390.0 million, a hypothetical 100 bps increase in LIBOR would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $15.8 million. Assuming no revolving credit borrowings, a hypothetical 100 bps increase in LIBOR would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $11.9 million. Item 8. Financial Stateme nts and Supplementary Data Our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto are provided in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Acco untants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Control s and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), require public companies, including us, to maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” which are defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act to mean a company’s controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required or necessary disclosures. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. The design of any controls and procedures also is based on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022. Based upon this evaluation, our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K due to a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which was initially disclosed as of September 30, 2021 and described below. Notwithstanding the above, the control deficiency did not result in a material misstatement of any of the Company’s annual or interim consolidated financial statements. Further, management believes and has concluded that the consolidated financial statements for the prior periods and included in this report fairly present, in all material respects, the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 58 Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting As required by the SEC’s rules and regulations for the implementation of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company, (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors, and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements in our consolidated financial statements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making these assessments, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessments and those criteria, management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, have concluded that a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, which was initially disclosed as of September 30, 2021, still exists as of December 31, 2022. The Company does not have sufficient policies and procedures related to certain Board oversight responsibilities of Board engagement within the Company’s control environment including delegation of authority. Accordingly, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Regulations under the Exchange Act require public companies, including our Company, to evaluate any change in our “internal control over financial reporting” as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent quarter covered by this Annual Report that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting, other than those disclosed in the status update section. Status Update Management and our Board of Directors are committed to remediating the above noted material weakness to address the deficiency within the control environment which resulted from a lack of sufficient policies and procedures surrounding the frequency, manner and extent in which Board members engage with management, resulting, in part, from increased Board engagement with management, as disclosed in Part I, Item 1, “ Current Operating Environment ” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As a result, management and the Board determined that it should establish and/or enhance additional policies and procedures relating to Board engagement and establish a process to evaluate adherence to these policies and procedures. Based upon a recommendation of the Audit Committee, the Board formed a committee (the “Committee”) and engaged independent consultants to advise the Committee and management as it relates to this deficiency to develop and execute on a remediation plan. Management continues to perform ongoing risk assessments. As a result of these assessments, management and the Committee continue to identify actions to remediate the material weakness, including the following actions: 59 Management will continue to perform ongoing risk assessment procedures, including continued enhancement, design and implementation of relevant controls, and will assess and test the effectiveness of these remediation efforts. As we continue to evaluate the effectiveness of the above remediation efforts, management may determine to take additional measures or to modify the remediation plan described above, which may require additional implementation time. The material weakness cannot be considered remediated until remediation efforts have operated for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, that the material weakness has been resolved. We will continue to assess the effectiveness of our remediation efforts in connection with our evaluations of internal control over financial reporting.

Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders’ equity (deficit), and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 1, 2023, expressed an adverse opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Revenue Recognition—Deferred Revenue Related to Annual and Season Admission Pass Products—Refer to Note 2 and Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company’s annual and seasonal admission pass products allow guests access to specific parks over a specified time period. Such revenue is deferred and recognized over the terms of the admission pass products based on estimated redemption rates for similar products and is adjusted periodically. The Company estimates redemption rates using historical and forecasted attendance trends by park. Attendance trends factor in seasonality and are adjusted based on actual trends periodically. Revenue is recognized on a pro rata basis based on the estimated allocated selling price of the admission product. The Company tracks and recognizes deferred revenue utilizing internally developed models. Auditing the attendance projections by park, which is the primary input used in the deferred revenue models, and the redemption rates calculated through the models, required extensive audit effort due to the complexity and manual nature of the models. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the attendance projections by park and the recognition of revenue from the deferred revenue related to annual and seasonal admission pass products included the following, among others: F- 2 /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Tampa, Florida March 1, 2023 We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2009. F- 3 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness identified below on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 of the Company and our report dated March 1, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Material Weakness A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weakness has been identified and included in management's assessment: The Company does not have sufficient policies and procedures related to certain Board oversight responsibilities of Board engagement within the Company’s control environment including delegation of authority. This material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, of the Company, and this report does not affect our report on such financial statements. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Tampa, Florida March 1, 2023 F- 4 SEAWORLD ENTERTAINMENT, INC.

F- 8 SEAWORLD ENTERTAINMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NO TES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc., through its wholly-owned subsidiary, SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc. (“SEA”) (collectively, the “Company”), owns and operates twelve theme parks within the United States. Prior to December 1, 2009, the Company did not have any operations. On December 1, 2009, the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity interest of Busch Entertainment LLC and affiliates from Anheuser Busch Companies, Inc. and Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (“ABI”). The Company completed an initial public offering in April 2013. As of December 31, 2022 , Hill Path Capital LP (""Hill Path"") owned approximately 42.6 % of the Company's total outstanding common stock. The Company operates SeaWorld theme parks in Orlando, Florida; San Antonio, Texas; and San Diego, California, and Busch Gardens theme parks in Tampa, Florida, and Williamsburg, Virginia. The Company operates water park attractions in Orlando, Florida (Aquatica); San Antonio, Texas (Aquatica); Tampa, Florida (Adventure Island); and Williamsburg, Virginia (Water Country USA). The Company also operates a reservations-only theme park in Orlando, Florida (Discovery Cove), a theme park in Langhorne, Pennsylvania (Sesame Place Philadelphia) and a theme park in Chula Vista, California (Sesame Place San Diego). During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, approximately 57 % and 58 % of the Company’s revenues were generated in the State of Florida which exposes the Company to risks affecting the Florida market, such as natural disasters, severe weather or other incidents. During the year ended December 31, 2020, more than 70 % of the Company’s revenues were generated in the State of Florida, due in part to the temporary park closures and limited operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. See Impact of Global COVID-19 Pandemic section which follows for further discussion. Impact of Global COVID-19 Pandemic The Company’s results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 continued to be impacted by the global COVID-19 pandemic due in part to a decline in both international and group-related attendance from historical levels. Additionally, the Company's results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were impacted by the following factors: (i) capacity limitations, modified/limited operations and/or temporary park closures which were in place for portions of the respective periods; (ii) decreased demand due to public concerns and government restrictions associated with the pandemic; and (iii) severe restrictions on international travel. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and in compliance with government restrictions, the Company temporarily closed all of its theme parks effective March 16, 2020. Beginning in June 2020, the Company began the phased reopening of some of its parks with enhanced health, safety and cleaning measures, capacity limitations and/or modified/limited operations, which at times included reduced hours and/or reduced operating days. By the end of August 2020, the Company had reopened 10 of its 12 parks on a limited basis and by the end of the second quarter of 2021, all of the Company’s 12 parks were open, and operating without COVID-19 related capacity limitations. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company took a number of proactive measures in 2020 for the safety of its guests, employees and animals, to manage costs and expenditures, and to maximize liquidity in response to the temporary park closures and limited reopenings related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of the measures to manage costs and expenditures taken in 2020 included, but were not limited to: (i) furloughed approximately 95% of its employees in 2020 upon closing all of its parks; (ii) temporarily reduced executive officers’ base salary by 20% through November 2020; (iii) eliminated and/or deferred all non-essential operating expenses at all of its parks and corporate headquarters while the parks were closed and actively managed operating expenses as parks reopened; (iv) eliminated substantially all advertising and marketing spend while the parks were closed and strategically managed marketing spend as parks reopened; and (v) substantially reduced or deferred all capital expenditures starting in March 2020 (other than minimal essential capital expenditures) when the parks were closed and postponed the opening of rides that were still under construction and scheduled to open in 2020. The Company continuously monitors guidance from federal, state and local authorities and engages with governmental authorities as well as medical/scientific consultants. The Company may adjust its plans accordingly as laws change and new information and guidance becomes available. The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a material impact on the Company’s financial results. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including SEA. All intercompany accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. F- 9 Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, the accounting for self-insurance, deferred tax assets and liabilities, deferred revenue, equity compensation, the valuation of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets and reviews for potential impairment of long-lived assets. Estimates are based on various factors including current and historical trends, as well as other pertinent company and industry data. The Company regularly evaluates this information to determine if it is necessary to update the basis for its estimates and to adjust for known changes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Based on the uncertainty relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, the emergence of new variants, and the current operating environment, including but not limited to the impact or timing of government restrictions, any future capacity limitations due to social distancing guidelines, public sentiment on social gatherings, travel and attendance patterns, travel restrictions, effectiveness and adoption of vaccines, boosters and/or medications, the impact of new variants, supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressures, foreign exchange rates and/or additional actions which could be taken by government authorities to manage the pandemic or other macroeconomic issues, the Company is not certain of the ultimate impact these factors could have on its estimates, business or results of operations. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash held at financial institutions as well as operating cash onsite at each theme park to fund daily operations and amounts due from third-party credit card companies with settlement terms of less than four days . The amounts due from third-party credit card companies totaled $ 18.6 million and $ 11.5 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021 , respectively. The cash balances in all accounts held at financial institutions are insured up to $ 250,000 by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) through December 31, 2022. At times, cash balances may exceed federally insured amounts and potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk. Management believes that no significant concentration of credit risk exists with respect to these cash balances because of its assessment of the creditworthiness and financial viability of the respective financial institutions. From time to time, the Company may invest in certain highly liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less. These instruments may include money market mutual funds, certificates of deposit or time deposits, among others, which may or may not qualify for FDIC insurance. The Company classifies any such instruments as cash and cash equivalents based on their short-term maturities. Restricted Cash Restricted cash is recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Restricted cash as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 consists primarily of advanced funds for which costs have yet to be incurred related to the Company’s international services agreements. See further discussion in Note 4–Revenues. December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 (In thousands) Cash and cash equivalents $ 79,196 $ 443,707 Restricted cash, included in prepaid expenses and other current assets 3,124 779 Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 82,320 $ 444,486 Accounts Receivable—Net Accounts receivable are reported at net realizable value and consist primarily of amounts due from customers for the sale of admission products, including amounts due for admissions products purchased on monthly installment arrangements. The Company is not exposed to a significant concentration of credit risk. The Company records an allowance on trade accounts receivable with an offset to the provision for bad debt for estimated credit losses expected based on its history of uncollectable accounts. For all periods presented, the provision for bad debt was immaterial. The Company also records an allowance for estimated credit losses on amounts due from monthly installment arrangements based on historical default rates. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded $ 13.8 million and $ 17.7 million, respectively, as an allowance on its installment arrangements, which is included in accounts receivable, net, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, with a corresponding reduction to deferred revenue. F- 10 Inventories Inventories are accounted for using the weighted average cost method and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventories consist primarily of products for resale, including merchandise, culinary items and miscellaneous supplies. Obsolete or excess inventories are recorded at their estimated realizable value. Property and Equipment—Net Property and equipment are recorded at cost. The cost of ordinary or routine maintenance, repairs, spare parts and minor renewals is expensed as incurred. Development costs associated with new attractions and products are generally capitalized after necessary feasibility studies have been completed and final concept or contracts have been approved. The cost of assets is depreciated using the straight-line method based on the following estimated useful lives: Land improvements 10 - 40 years Buildings 5 - 40 years Rides, attractions and equipment 3 - 20 years Animals 1 - 50 years Certain costs related to animals exhibited in the theme parks are capitalized and amortized over their estimated lives ( 1 - 50 years ). All costs to care for animals are expensed as incurred. Construction in progress assets consist primarily of new rides, attractions and infrastructure improvements that have not yet been placed in service. These assets are stated at cost and are not depreciated. Once construction of the assets is completed and placed into service, assets are reclassified to the appropriate asset class based on their nature and depreciated in accordance with the useful lives above. Debt interest is capitalized on all active construction projects. Total interest capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 6.3 million, $ 7.3 million and $ 6.3 million, respectively. Computer System Development Costs The Company capitalizes computer system development costs that meet established criteria and, once placed in service, amortizes those costs to expense on a straight-line basis over five years . Total capitalized costs related to computer system development costs, net of accumulated amortization, were $ 2.0 million and $ 1.5 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 , respectively, and are recorded in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Accumulated amortization was $ 12.9 million and $ 12.4 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Amortization expense of capitalized computer system development costs during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 0.7 million, $ 1.4 million and $ 1.7 million, respectively, and is recorded in depreciation and amortization in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Systems reengineering costs do not meet the proper criteria for capitalization and are expensed as incurred. Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but instead reviewed for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter, and as of an interim date should factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim test, with ongoing recoverability based on applicable reporting unit overall financial performance and consideration of significant events or changes in the overall business environment or macroeconomic conditions. Such events or changes in the overall business environment could include, but are not limited to, significant negative trends or unanticipated changes in the competitive or macroeconomic environment. In assessing goodwill for impairment, the Company may choose to initially evaluate qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The Company considers several factors, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance of the reporting unit, changes in management, strategy or customers, and relevant reporting unit specific events such as a change in the carrying amount of net assets, a more likely than not expectation of selling or disposing all, or a portion, of a reporting unit, and the testing of recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment is not conclusive, then a quantitative impairment analysis for goodwill is performed at the reporting unit level. The Company may also choose to perform this quantitative impairment analysis instead of the qualitative analysis. The quantitative impairment analysis compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, determined using the income and/or market approach, to its recorded amount. If the recorded amount exceeds the fair value, then a goodwill impairment charge is recorded for the difference up to the recorded amount of goodwill. The determination of fair value in the Company’s goodwill impairment analysis is based on an estimate of fair value for the relevant reporting unit utilizing known and estimated inputs at the evaluation date. Some of those inputs include, but are not limited to, estimates of future revenue and expense growth, estimated market multiples, expected capital expenditures, income tax rates and cost of invested capital. F- 11 The Company’s other indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of certain trade names/trademarks and other intangible assets which, after considering legal, regulatory, contractual, and other competitive and economic factors, are determined to have indefinite lives and are valued using the relief from royalty method. Trade names/trademarks are combined by brand as a unit of accounting when testing for impairment as the brand represents the highest and best use of the asset and drives the Company’s marketing strategy and international license agreements. Estimates required in this valuation method include estimated future revenues impacted by the trade names/trademarks, royalty rates, and appropriate discount rates. Projections are based on management’s best estimates given recent financial performance, market trends, strategic plans, brand awareness, operating characteristics by park, and other available information. See Note 9–Goodwill and Trade Names/Trademarks, Net, for further details. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets All long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. An impairment loss may be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset, including disposition, are less than the carrying value of the asset. The measurement of the impairment loss to be recognized is based upon the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying amounts of the assets. Fair value is generally determined based upon a discounted cash flow analysis. In order to determine if an asset has been impaired, assets are grouped and tested at the lowest level for which identifiable independent cash flows are available (generally a theme park). See further discussion in Note 8–Property and Equipment, Net. Self-Insurance Reserves Reserves are recorded for the estimated amounts of guest and employee claims and expenses incurred each period that are not covered by insurance. Reserves are established for both identified claims and incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) claims. Such amounts are accrued for when claim amounts become probable and estimable. Reserves for identified claims are based upon the Company’s historical claims experience and third-party estimates of settlement costs. Reserves for IBNR claims are based upon the Company’s claims data history, actuarially determined loss development factors and qualitative considerations such as claims management activities. The Company maintains self-insurance reserves for healthcare, auto, general liability and workers’ compensation claims. Total claims reserves were $ 37.0 million at December 31, 2022 , of which $ 1.8 million is recorded in accrued salaries, wages and benefits, $ 8.6 million is recorded in other accrued liabilities and the remaining long-term portion is recorded in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Total claims reserves were $ 30.5 million at December 31, 2021 , of which $ 1.7 million is recorded in accrued salaries, wages and benefits, $ 8.2 million is recorded in other accrued liabilities and the remaining long-term portion is recorded in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. All reserves are periodically reviewed for changes in facts and circumstances and adjustments are made as necessary. Debt Issuance Costs Debt issuance costs are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the related debt and are included in long-term debt, net, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. See further discussion in Note 11–Long-Term Debt. Share Repurchase Program and Treasury Stock From time to time, the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) may authorize share repurchases of common stock. Shares repurchased under Board authorizations are currently held in treasury for general corporate purposes. The Company accounts for treasury stock on the trade date under the cost method. Treasury stock at December 31, 2022 and 2021 is reflected within stockholders’ deficit. See further discussion of the Company’s share repurchase program in Note 19–Stockholders’ Deficit. Revenue Recognition The Company records revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”), Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements within the scope of ASC 606, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contracts with customers; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies the performance obligations. ASC 606 also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts. Revenue is recorded net of sales-related taxes collected from guests and remitted or payable to government taxing authorities. F- 12 Admissions Revenue Admissions revenue primarily consists of single-day tickets, annual or season passes or other multi-day or multi-park admission products. Admission products with similar characteristics are analyzed using a portfolio approach for each separate park as the Company expects that the effects on the consolidated financial statements of applying ASC 606 to the portfolio does not differ materially from applying the guidance to individual contracts within the portfolio. For single-day tickets, the Company recognizes revenue at a point in time, upon admission to the park. Annual passes, season passes or other multi-day or multi-park passes allow guests access to specific parks over a specified time period. For these pass and multi-use products, revenue is deferred and recognized over the terms of the admission product based on estimated redemption rates for similar products and is adjusted periodically. The Company estimates redemption rates using historical and forecasted attendance trends by park for similar products. Attendance trends factor in seasonality and are adjusted based on actual trends periodically. These estimated redemption rates impact the timing of when revenue is recognized on these products. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates based on actual attendance patterns. Revenue is recognized on a pro-rata basis based on the estimated allocated selling price of the admission product. For pass products purchased on an installment plan that have met their initial commitment period and have transitioned to a month to month basis, monthly charges are recognized as revenue as payments are received each month, with the exception of payments received during the temporary park closures in 2020 (see further discussion which follows). For multi-day admission products, revenue is allocated based on the number of visits included in the pass and recognized ratably based on each admission into the theme park. In 2020, as a result of the temporary park closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company upgraded some of its pass products and extended pass expiration dates for at least the equivalent period the related parks were closed. As a result, the Company adjusted its estimated redemption and recognition patterns on these products to reflect the fact that there was no attendance during the park closures and accordingly the Company did not recognize revenue from these admission products while the parks were temporarily closed in 2020. For passes under installment plans that had transitioned to a month to month basis, the Company temporarily paused monthly charges when the related parks reopened for the equivalent period the respective parks were closed. Accordingly, payments received during the closure period were recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue once the respective parks reopened in 2020, which may not have necessarily reflected attendance patterns for these guests. The Company has entered into agreements with certain external theme park, zoo and other attraction operators to jointly market and sell single and multi-use admission products. These joint products allow admission to both a Company park(s) and an external park, zoo or other attraction. The agreements with the external partners specify the allocation of revenue to Company parks from any jointly sold products. Whether the Company or the external partner sells the product, the Company’s portion of revenue is deferred until the first time the product is redeemed at one of the Company’s parks and recognized over its related use in a manner consistent with the Company’s other admission products. Additionally, the Company barters theme park admission products and sponsorship opportunities for advertising, employee recognition awards, and various other services. The fair value of the products or services is recognized into admissions revenue and related expenses at the time of the exchange and approximates the estimated fair value of the goods or services provided or received, whichever is more readily determinable. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, amounts included within admissions revenue with an offset to either selling, general and administrative expenses or operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) related to bartered ticket transactions were $ 14.8 million, $ 13.6 million and $ 4.7 million, respectively. Food, Merchandise and Other Revenue Food, merchandise and other revenue primarily consists of food and beverage, retail, merchandise, parking and other in-park products and also includes other miscellaneous revenue which is not significant in the periods presented. The Company recognizes revenue for food and beverage, merchandise and other in-park products when the related products or services are received by the guests. Certain admission products may also include bundled products at the time of purchase, such as food and beverage or merchandise items. The Company conducts an analysis of bundled products to identify separate distinct performance obligations that are material in the context of the contract. For those products that are determined to be distinct performance obligations and material in the context of the contract, the Company allocates a portion of the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation using each performance obligation’s standalone price. If the bundled product is related to a pass product and offered over time, revenue will be recognized over time accordingly. See further discussion in Note 4–Revenues. Advertising and Promotional Costs Advertising production costs are deferred and expensed the first time the advertisement is shown. Other advertising and media costs are expensed as incurred and, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 , totaled approximately $ 104.3 million, $ 81.4 million and $ 48.1 million, respectively, and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). F- 13 Equity-Based Compensation In accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation , the Company measures the cost of employee services rendered in exchange for equity-based compensation based upon the grant date fair market value. The cost is recognized over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period unless service or performance conditions require otherwise. The Company recognizes equity compensation expense for its performance-vesting restricted awards ratably over the related performance period if the performance condition is probable of being achieved. If the probability of vesting related to these awards changes in a subsequent period, all equity compensation expense related to those awards that would have been recorded over the requisite service period had the awards been considered probable at the new percentage from inception, is recorded as a cumulative catch-up at such subsequent date. The Company recognizes the impact of forfeitures as they occur. The Company grants time-vesting restricted shares and units, time-vesting deferred stock units, performance-vesting restricted shares and units, and stock options. The Company uses the closing stock price on the date of grant to value its time-vesting and performance-vesting restricted share awards. The Company uses the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model to value stock options at the date of grant. On occasion, the Company may modify the terms or conditions of an equity award for its employees. If an award is modified, the Company evaluates the type of modification in accordance with ASC 718 to determine the appropriate accounting. See further discussion in Note 18–Equity-Based Compensation. Leases The Company leases land, warehouse and office space, and equipment, which are classified as either operating or finance leases. Under the provisions of ASC 842, Leases, lease liabilities and right of use assets are recognized at the lease commencement date on the basis of the present value of the future lease payments, with the right of use being adjusted by any prepaid or accrued rent, lease incentives, and initial direct costs. The lease term for each lease includes the noncancelable period plus any periods subject to an option for renewal when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. The subsequent measurement of a lease is dependent on whether the lease is classified as an operating or finance lease. Operating leases have a straight-line expense pattern that is recognized as either operating expenses or selling, general, and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Finance leases have a front-loaded expense recognition pattern that is comprised of amortization expense and interest expense that is included in depreciation and amortization and interest expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). The Company initially evaluates the classification of its leases as of the lease commencement date and reevaluates the classification of its leases upon the occurrence of certain lease remeasurement events and when there is a lease modification that is not accounted for as a separate contract. The present value of future lease payments is calculated using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Company’s incremental borrowing rate, which reflects the rate of interest it would pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments under similar terms. As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses incremental borrowing rates based on the information available at the lease commencement date, liability remeasurement date, or lease modification date in determining the present value of the lease payments. In calculating the incremental borrowing rates, the Company considered recent ratings from credit agencies, recent trading prices on the Company’s debt, and current lease demographic information. The Company applies the incremental borrowing rates at a portfolio level based on lease terms. In accordance with the short-term lease recognition exemption of ASC 842, the Company does not recognize on its balance sheet leases with an initial lease term of 12 months or less. Lease expense for these short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Some of the Company’s leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from one to ten years or more. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Company’s sole discretion and the inclusion of the renewal options in the lease term would only occur when the Company concludes it is reasonably certain of exercising the option(s). Certain leases also include options to purchase the leased property. Certain of the Company’s lease agreements include rental payments based on a percentage of sales over contractual levels and others include rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation. These variable lease payments are typically recognized when the underlying event occurs and are included in operating expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) in the same line item as the expense arising from fixed lease payments. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees, material restrictive covenants or material variable lease costs other than those described in Note 14–Leases related to the Company’s land lease. All long-lived assets, including right of use assets associated with leases, are reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. The measurement of an impairment loss to be recognized is based upon the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying amounts of the assets. Fair value is generally determined based upon a discounted cash flow analysis. See further discussion in Note 14–Leases. F- 14 Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Realization is dependent on generating sufficient future taxable income or the reversal of deferred tax liabilities during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Forecasted financial performance is not used as evidence until such time as the Company has cumulative pretax income for a rolling 36-month period. The Company evaluates its tax positions by determining if it is more likely than not a tax position is sustainable upon examination, based upon the technical merits of the position, before any of the benefit is recorded for financial statement purposes. The benefit is measured as the largest dollar amount of the position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon settlement. Previously recorded benefits that no longer meet the more likely than not threshold are charged to earnings in the period that the determination is made. Interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits are charged to the provision for (benefit from) income taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). See further discussion in Note 13–Income Taxes. Contingencies The Company accounts for contingencies in accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies . For loss contingencies, such as potential legal settlements, the Company records an estimated loss when payment is considered probable and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company, the Company evaluates the perceived merits of the legal proceedings as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein. If a loss is considered probable but the best estimate of the loss can only be identified within a range and no specific amount within that range is more likely, then the minimum of the range is accrued. Legal and related professional services costs to defend litigation are expensed as incurred. Insurance recoveries related to potential claims are recognized up to the amount of the recorded liability when coverage is confirmed and the estimated recoveries are probable of payment. These recoveries are not netted against the related liabilities for financial statement presentation. Additionally, for any potential gain contingencies, the Company does not recognize the gain until the period that all contingencies have been resolved and the amounts are realizable. See further discussion in Note 15–Commitments and Contingencies. F air Value Measurements Fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement and is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. An entity is permitted to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each period. The Company has not elected to use the fair value option for any of its financial assets and financial liabilities that are not already recorded at fair value. Carrying values of financial instruments classified as current assets and current liabilities approximate fair value, due to their short-term nature. Fair Value Hierarchy —As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, fair value accounting standards establish a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity. Fair value is determined for assets and liabilities, based upon significant levels of observable or unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s market assumptions. This hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. These two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy: Level 1 —Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Level 2 —Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets. Level 3 —Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. Determination of Fair Value —If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed valuation techniques that use, where possible, current market-based or independently sourced market parameters, such as interest and currency rates. Assets or liabilities valued using such internally generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation. Thus, an item may be classified in Level 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that are readily observable. See further discussion in Note 16–Fair Value Measurements. F- 15 Segment Reporting The Company maintains discrete financial information for each of its twelve theme parks, which is used by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”), as a basis for allocating resources and assessing performance. Each theme park has been identified as an operating segment and meets the criteria for aggregation due to similar economic characteristics. In addition, all of the theme parks provide similar products and services and share similar processes for delivering services. The theme parks have a high degree of similarity in the workforces and target similar consumer groups. Accordingly, based on these economic and operational similarities and the way the CODM monitors and makes decisions affecting the operations, the Company has concluded that its operating segments may be aggregated and that it has one reportable segment. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging , provides the disclosure requirements for derivatives and hedging activities with the intent to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of: (i) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (ii) how the entity accounts for derivative instruments and related hedged items, and (iii) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Further, qualitative disclosures are required that explain the Company’s objectives and strategies for using derivatives, as well as quantitative disclosures about the fair value of, and gains and losses on, derivative instruments, and disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative instruments. As required by ASC 815, the Company records all derivatives, if any, on the balance sheet at fair value as either assets or liabilities. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. For derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk, the changes in fair value of the derivative contract are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, and subsequently reclassified into interest expense in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge. The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of its risk, even though hedge accounting does not apply or the Company elects not to apply hedge accounting. See further discussion in Note 12–Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. 3. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS The Company reviews new accounting pronouncements as they are issued or proposed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). There are no recent accounting pronouncements or recently implemented accounting standards that are expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements or disclosures. 4. REVENUES Deferred revenue primarily includes revenue associated with pass products, admission or in-park products or services with a future intended use date and contract liability balances related to licensing and international agreements collected in advance of the Company satisfying its performance obligations and is expected to be recognized in future periods. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, $ 14.2 million and $ 14.5 million, respectively, is included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets related to the long-term portion of deferred revenue, which primarily relates to the Company’s international agreement, as discussed in the following section. The following table reflects the Company’s deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2022 and 2021: 2022 2021 (In thousands) Deferred revenue, including long-term portion $ 183,772 $ 169,333 Less: Deferred revenue, long-term portion, included in other liabilities 14,237 14,540 Deferred revenue, short-term portion $ 169,535 $ 154,793 The Company estimates substantially all of the deferred revenue, short term portion, balance outstanding as of December 31, 2021 was recognized as revenue during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. For certain admission products, the Company estimated timing of redemption using average historical redemption rates. F- 16 International Agreements The Company has previously received $ 10.0 million in deferred revenue which is recorded in other liabilities related to a nonrefundable payment received from a partner in connection with a project in the Middle East to provide certain services pertaining to the planning and design of SeaWorld Abu Dhabi, a marine life theme park on Yas Island (the “Middle East Project”), with funding received expected to offset internal expenses. The Middle East Project is on track with the park expected to open in 2023. The Company also receives additional funds from its partner related to agreed-upon services and reimbursements of costs incurred by the Company on behalf of the Middle East Project (the “Middle East Services Agreements”). Revenue and expenses associated with the Middle East Project will begin to be recognized when substantially all the services have been performed which is anticipated to occur in 2023, when SeaWorld Abu Dhabi is expected to open. Revenue and expenses associated with the Middle East Services Agreements will be recognized upon completion of the respective performance obligations. As a result of the Middle East Project, approximately $ 0.5 million of costs incurred by the Company are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets as of December 31, 2022 and approximately $ 11.2 million, $ 8.4 million and $ 5.9 million of other related costs incurred are recorded in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Separately, deferred revenue of approximately $ 0.6 million is recorded in deferred revenue as of December 31, 2022 and approximately $ 14.2 million, $ 12.5 million and $ 11.9 million of long-term deferred revenue is recorded in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, related to the Middle East Project, which includes the $ 10.0 million nonrefundable payment previously discussed for each period. As a result of the Middle East Services Agreements, approximately $ 2.0 million of costs incurred by the Company are recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets as of December 31, 2022 and approximately $ 1.2 million of costs are recorded in other assets as of December 31, 2021 in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Separately, deferred revenue of approximately $ 5.1 million is recorded in deferred revenue as of December 31, 2022 and approximately $ 2.0 million is recorded in other liabilities as of December 31, 2021 in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 5. EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE Earnings (loss) per share is computed as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Net Income Shares Per Share Amount Net Income Shares Per Share Amount Net Loss Shares Per Share Amount (In thousands, except per share amounts) Basic earnings (loss) per share $ 291,190 69,607 $ 4.18 $ 256,513 78,302 $ 3.28 $ ( 312,321 ) 78,194 $ ( 3.99 ) Effect of dilutive incentive-based awards 673 1,273 — Diluted earnings (loss) per share $ 291,190 70,280 $ 4.14 $ 256,513 79,575 $ 3.22 $ ( 312,321 ) 78,194 $ ( 3.99 ) In accordance with ASC 260, Earnings Per Share , basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period (excluding treasury stock and unvested restricted stock awards). Unvested restricted stock awards are eligible to receive dividends, if any; however, dividend rights will be forfeited if the award does not vest. Accordingly, only vested shares of formerly restricted stock are included in the calculation of basic earnings (loss) per share. The weighted average number of repurchased shares during the period, if any, which are held as treasury stock, are excluded from shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is determined using the treasury stock method based on the dilutive effect of certain unvested restricted stock awards and certain shares of common stock that are issuable upon exercise of stock options. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were approximately 277,000 and 146,000 anti-dilutive shares of common stock excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2020, there were approximately 2,253,000 potentially dilutive shares of common stock excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share as their effect would have been anti-dilutive due to the Company’s net loss in the period. The Company’s outstanding performance-vesting restricted stock awards are considered contingently issuable shares and are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share until the performance measure criteria is met as of the end of the reporting period. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately 236,000 and 352,000 performance-vesting restricted stock awards had met their performance criteria for their respective performance years as of the end of the reporting periods, respectively, and are therefore included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share. See further discussion in Note 18–Equity-Based Compensation. F- 17 6. INVENTORIES Inventories as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 consisted of the following: 2022 2021 (In thousands) Merchandise $ 49,422 $ 23,960 Food and beverage 5,768 5,518 Total inventories $ 55,190 $ 29,478 As of December 31, 2022, the increase in merchandise inventory was primarily due to a combination of significant inflationary pressures and increased freight costs along with increased volume purchases and the timing of order deliveries as compared to December 31, 2021. 7.

For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded approximately $ 7.2 million, $ 6.6 million and $ 6.7 million, respectively, in fixed asset write-offs, which is included in operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss). See Note 1–Description of the Business, Impact of Global COVID-19 Pandemic , for further details regarding proactive measures the Company took starting in March 2020 relating to its capital expenditures including delaying the opening of certain new rides. F- 18 9. GOODWILL AND TRADE NAMES/TRADEMARKS, NET Goodwill, Net Goodwill, net, at December 31, 2022 and 2021 relates to the Company’s Discovery Cove reporting unit. The Company performed an annual qualitative assessment in the fourth quarter of 2022 and 2021 and concluded that further evaluation was unnecessary. Trade Names/Trademarks, Net During the fourth quarter of 2022 and 2021, the Company performed a qualitative assessment for its indefinite-lived intangible assets and concluded that further evaluation was unnecessary.

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, accrued interest above primarily relates to interest associated with the Company’s senior notes issued in August 2021, for which interest is paid bi-annually in February and August and the first-priority senior secured notes issued in April 2020, for which interest is paid bi-annually in November and May. See further discussion in Note 11–Long-Term Debt. 11. LONG-TERM DEBT Long-term debt, net, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 consisted of the following: 2022 2021 (In thousands) Term B Loans (effective interest rate of 7.44 % and 3.50 % at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively) $ 1,185,000 $ 1,197,000 Senior Notes due 2029 (interest rate of 5.25 %) 725,000 725,000 First-Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2025 (interest rate of 8.75 %) 227,500 227,500 Total long-term debt 2,137,500 2,149,500 Less: unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs ( 26,441 ) ( 32,665 ) Less: current maturities ( 12,000 ) ( 12,000 ) Total long-term debt, net $ 2,099,059 $ 2,104,835 Refinancing Transactions On August 25, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), SEA entered into a Restatement Agreement (the “Restatement Agreement”) pursuant to which SEA amended and restated its then existing senior secured credit agreement dated as of December 1, 2009 (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, and the senior secured credit facilities thereunder (the “Existing Secured Credit Facilities”), and, as amended and restated by the Restatement Agreement (the “Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”). F- 19 The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provides for senior secured financing of up to $ 1,585.0 million, consisting of: Also on the Closing Date, SEA completed a private offering of $ 725.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.250 % unsecured senior notes due 2029 (the “Senior Notes”). See Senior Notes section which follows for more details. The Company used proceeds of the Term B Loans drawn on the Closing Date, together with the proceeds from the offering of the Senior Notes and cash on hand, to fully redeem the remaining $ 400.0 million of SEA’s then outstanding 9.500 % second-priority senior secured notes due 2025 (the “Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes”) (the ""Full Redemption""), to refinance the SEA’s Existing Secured Credit Facilities, and to pay related expenses of the offering and refinancing (collectively, the “Refinancing Transactions”). As a result of the Refinancing Transactions, on the Closing Date, SEA terminated its Existing Secured Credit Facilities and associated Term B-5 Loans and repaid all of its related outstanding obligations in respect of principal, interest and fees. Prior to the Refinancing Transactions, on July 14, 2021, SEA completed a redemption of $ 50.0 million of its then outstanding Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes and separately on August 25, 2021, SEA completed another redemption of $ 50.0 million of its then outstanding Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes (collectively, the “Partial Redemptions”). Pursuant to the Partial Redemptions, the aggregate principal amount of the Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes were redeemed at a price equal to 103.000 % of the respective principal amounts thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the respective redemption dates. In connection with the Refinancing Transactions, SEA also redeemed the remaining $ 400.0 million of its Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes (the “Full Redemption”). Pursuant to the Full Redemption, all of the aggregate principal amount of the Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes were redeemed at a price equal to the sum of (a) 100.000 % of the outstanding principal amount of the Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes redeemed pursuant to the Full Redemption plus (b) approximately $ 34.3 million related to the Applicable Premium (as defined in the respective indenture), which is included in loss on early extinguishment of debt and write-off of discounts and debt issuance costs for the year ended December 31, 2021, plus (c) accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date. Discounts and Debt Issuance Costs In connection with the Refinancing Transactions, SEA recorded a discount of $ 12.0 million and debt issuance costs of $ 12.7 million, of which $ 2.8 million were paid directly to lenders, during the year ended December 31, 2021. Additionally, SEA wrote-off debt issuance costs and discounts of $ 21.5 million which is included in loss on early extinguishment of debt and write-off of discounts and debt issuance costs in the accompanying consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2021. In connection with the issuance of the First-Priority Senior Secured Notes and Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes, and as a result of certain amendments in 2020 to SEA’s then existing senior secured credit agreement, as previously disclosed, SEA recorded discounts and fees of approximately $ 21.9 million, of which approximately $ 13.8 million were paid directly to lenders, during the year ended December 31, 2020. Senior Secured Credit Facilities Borrowings under the Term B Loans bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to, at the Company’s option, (i) a base rate equal to the higher of (a) the federal funds rate plus 1/2 of 1%, (b) the rate of interest quoted in the print edition of the Wall Street Journal, Money Rates Section as the prime rate as in effect from time to time and (c) one-month Adjusted LIBOR plus 1% per annum (provided that in no event shall such ABR rate with respect to the Term B Loans be less than 1.50% per annum) (“ ABR ”), in each case, plus an applicable margin of 2.00% or (ii) a LIBOR rate for the applicable interest period (provided that in no event shall such LIBOR rate with respect to the Term B Loans be less than 0.50% per annum) (“ LIBOR ”) plus an applicable margin of 3.00%. Borrowings of the Revolving Loans bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to, at the Company’s option, (i) ABR (provided that in no event shall such ABR rate with respect to the Revolving Loans be less than 1.00% per annum) plus an applicable margin equal to 1.75% or (ii) LIBOR (provided that in no event shall such LIBOR rate with respect to the Revolving Loans be less than 0.00%) plus an applicable margin of 2.75%. The applicable margin for borrowings of Revolving Loans are subject to one 25 basis point step-down upon achievement by the Company of certain corporate credit ratings, which was achieved during 2022. F- 20 In addition to paying interest on the outstanding principal under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee equal to 0.50 % per annum to the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder. The Company will also be required to pay customary agency fees as well as letter of credit participation fees computed at a rate per annum equal to the applicable margin for LIBOR rate borrowings on the dollar equivalent of the daily stated amount of outstanding letters of credit, plus such letter of credit issuer’s customary documentary and processing fees and charges and a fronting fee computed at a rate equal to 0.125 % per annum on the daily stated amount of each letter of credit. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities require scheduled amortization payments on the term loans in quarterly amounts equal to 0.25 % of the original principal amount of the Term B Loans, payable quarterly, with the balance to be paid at maturity. In addition, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities require the Company to prepay outstanding term loan borrowings, subject to certain exceptions, with: The Company may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities at any time, without prepayment premium or penalty, except in connection with a repricing event in respect of the term loans as described below, subject to customary “breakage” costs with respect to LIBOR rate loans. All borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including the absence of a default or event of default and the accuracy of representations and warranties in all material respects. All obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities are unconditionally guaranteed by the Company on a limited-recourse basis and each of SEA’s existing and future direct and indirect wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The obligations are secured by a pledge of SEA’s capital stock directly held by the Company and substantially all of SEA’s assets and those of each guarantor (other than the Company), including a pledge of the capital stock of all entities directly held by SEA or the guarantors, in each case subject to exceptions. Such security interests consist of a first-priority lien with respect to the collateral. As of December 31, 2022, SEA had approximately $ 18.4 million of outstanding letters of credit, leaving approximately $ 371.6 million available under the Revolving Credit Facility, which was not drawn upon as of December 31, 2022. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, SEA borrowed $ 20.0 million on the Revolving Credit Facility for general working capital purposes. Senior Notes The Senior Notes will mature on August 15, 2029 . Interest on the Senior Notes will accrue at 5.250 % per annum and will be paid semi-annually, in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year. On or after August 15, 2024, SEA may redeem the Senior Notes, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, if redeemed during the 12-month period commencing on August 15 of the years as follows: (i) in 2024 at 102.625 %; (ii) in 2025 at 101.313 %; and (iii) in 2026 and thereafter at 100 %. In addition, prior to August 15, 2024, SEA may redeem the Senior Notes at its option, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at a redemption price equal to 100 % of the principal amount of the Senior Notes redeemed, plus the “Applicable Premium” and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to the provisions set forth in the Indenture, at any time and from time to time on or prior to August 15, 2024, SEA may redeem in the aggregate up to 40 % of the original aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes (calculated after giving effect to any issuance of additional Senior Notes) in an aggregate amount equal to the net cash proceeds of one or more equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 105.250 %, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. Additionally, upon the occurrence of specified change of control events, each holder will have the right to require SEA to repurchase all or any part of such holder’s notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101 %. SEA’s obligations under the Senior Notes and related indenture are guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior secured basis, by the Guarantors, as defined, in accordance with the provisions of the indenture. F- 21 First-Priority Senior Secured Notes On April 30, 2020, SEA closed on a private offering of $ 227.5 million aggregate principal amount of 8.750 % first-priority senior secured notes (the “First-Priority Senior Secured Notes”) which mature on May 1, 2025 and have interest payment dates of May 1 and November 1. SEA may redeem the First-Priority Senior Secured Notes at its option, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date, if redeemed during the 12-month period commencing on May 1 of the years as follows: (i) in 2022 at 104.375 %; (ii) in 2023 at 102.188 %; and (iii) in 2024 and thereafter at 100 %. SEA may also redeem in the aggregate (at a redemption price expressed as a percentage of principal amount thereof): (i) 100 % of the First-Priority Senior Secured Notes after certain events constituting a change of control at a redemption price of 101 %, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date and (ii) up to 40% of the original aggregate principal amount of the First-Priority Senior Secured Notes with amounts equal to the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price of 108.750 %, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. The First-Priority Senior Secured Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company, any subsidiary of the Company that directly or indirectly owns 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of SEA, and subject to certain exceptions, each of SEA’s subsidiaries that guarantees SEA’s existing senior secured credit facilities. Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes On August 5, 2020, SEA closed on a private offering of $ 500.0 million aggregate principal amount of Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes. Net of expenses related to the offering of the Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes and an amendment to its then existing senior secured credit agreement, the Company used a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes to repay the then outstanding borrowings of $ 311.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes were scheduled to mature on August 1, 2025 and had interest payment dates of February 1 and August 1. See additional discussion in the preceding Refinancing Transactions section regarding the full redemption of the Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes in 2021. Restrictive Covenants The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indentures governing the Senior Notes and First-Priority Senior Secured Notes (collectively, the “Debt Agreements”), contain covenants that limit the ability of the Company, SEA and its restricted subsidiaries to, among other things: (i) incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares; (ii) make dividend payments on or make other distributions in respect of their capital stock or make other restricted payments; (iii) make certain investments; (iv) sell certain assets; (v) create or permit to exist dividend and/or payment restrictions affecting their restricted subsidiaries; (vi) create liens on assets; (vii) consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of their assets; and (viii) enter into certain transactions with their affiliates. These covenants are subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions and are based, in part on the Company’s ability to satisfy certain tests and engage in certain transactions based on Covenant Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the related Debt Agreements. Covenant Adjusted EBITDA includes certain adjustments permitted under the relevant agreements, including but not limited to estimated cost savings, recruiting and retention costs, public company compliance costs, litigation and arbitration costs and other costs and adjustments as permitted under the Debt Agreements. The Debt Agreements contain certain customary events of default, including relating to a change of control. If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the Debt Agreements will be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the Debt Agreements and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor in respect of the collateral securing the Debt Agreements. The Revolving Credit Facility requires that the Company, commencing as of the last day of the first full fiscal quarter after the Closing Date and subject to a testing threshold, comply on a quarterly basis with a maximum net first lien senior secured leverage ratio of 6.25 to 1.00 . The testing threshold will be satisfied (and therefore the covenant must be complied with at the end of such quarter) if the aggregate amount of funded loans and issued letters of credit (excluding up to $ 30.0 million of undrawn letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility and letters of credit that are cash collateralized) under the Revolving Credit Facility on such date exceeds an amount equal to 35 % of the then-outstanding commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Debt Agreements permit an unlimited capacity for restricted payments if the net total leverage ratio on a pro forma basis does not exceed 4.25 to 1.00 after giving effect to the payment of any such restricted payment. As of December 31, 2022, the net total leverage ratio as calculated under the Debt Agreements was 2.78 to 1.00. As of December 31, 2022, SEA was in compliance with all covenants contained in the documents governing the Debt Agreements. F- 22 Long-term debt at December 31, 2022, is repayable as follows and does not include the impact of any future voluntary prepayments: Years Ending December 31, (In thousands) 2023 $ 12,000 2024 12,000 2025 239,500 2026 12,000 2027 12,000 Thereafter 1,850,000 Total $ 2,137,500 Interest Rate Swap Agreements The Company previously had five interest rate swap agreements (the “Interest Rate Swap Agreements”) which effectively fixed the interest rate on the LIBOR-indexed interest payments associated with $ 1.0 billion of SEA’s outstanding long-term debt. The Interest Rate Swap Agreements expired on May 14, 2020 . SEA designated the Interest Rate Swap Agreements above as qualifying cash flow hedge accounting relationships as further discussed in Note 12–Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities which follows. Cash paid for interest relating to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Senior Notes, the First-Priority Senior Secured Notes, the Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes and the Interest Rate Swap Agreements, net of amounts capitalized, as applicable, was $ 110.9 million, $ 116.1 million and $ 73.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 , respectively. See Note 10–Other Accrued Liabilities for accrued interest included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. 12. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Risk Management Objective of Using Derivatives The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources and duration of its debt funding and at times through the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the Company has previously entered into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. The Company’s derivative financial instruments, if any, are used to manage differences in the amount, timing and duration of the Company’s known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to the Company’s borrowings. The Company does not speculate using derivative instruments. In May 2020, the Company’s Interest Rate Swap Agreements expired. As such, the Company did no t have any derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk The Company’s objectives in using interest rate derivatives were to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily used interest rate swaps at times as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. During the year ended December 31, 2020, such derivatives were used to hedge a portion of the variable cash flows associated with existing variable-rate debt. The Interest Rate Swap Agreements were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk. The changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and were subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affected earnings. Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to derivatives were reclassified to interest expense as interest payments were made on the Company’s variable-rate debt. F- 23 Tabular Disclosure of the Effect of Derivative Instruments on the Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) The table below presents the pre-tax effect of the Company’s derivative financial instruments in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2020: Year Ended December 31, 2020 (In thousands) Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships: Loss recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) $ ( 370 ) Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to interest expense $ 2,501 Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) The following table reflects the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, for the year ended December 31, 2020: Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (In thousands): (Losses) Gains on Cash Flow Hedges Accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31, 2019 ( 1,559 ) Other comprehensive loss before reclassifications ( 271 ) Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense 1,830 Change in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax 1,559 Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at December 31, 2020 $ — 13. INCOME TAXES For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the provision for (benefit from) income taxes is comprised of the following: 2022 2021 2020 Current income tax provision (In thousands) Federal $ ( 31 ) $ ( 31 ) $ ( 136 ) State 3,427 3,984 1,020 Foreign — — 5 Total current income tax provision 3,396 3,953 889 Deferred income tax provision (benefit): Federal 71,642 345 ( 19,718 ) State 23,845 ( 4,462 ) ( 11,696 ) Total deferred income tax provision (benefit) 95,487 ( 4,117 ) ( 31,414 ) Total income tax provision (benefit) $ 98,883 $ ( 164 ) $ ( 30,525 ) The deferred income tax provision (benefit) represents the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Cash paid for income taxes totaled $ 1.6 million, $ 5.9 million and $ 0.5 million, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. F- 24 The components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows: 2022 2021 Deferred income tax assets: (In thousands) Acquisition and debt related costs $ 3,270 $ 4,292 Net operating losses 156,176 199,656 Goodwill impairment 53,684 53,677 Self-insurance 8,816 7,220 Deferred revenue 2,520 2,878 Restricted stock 7,911 9,509 Tax credits 11,847 10,718 Legal settlements — 855 Lease obligations 29,117 29,410 Interest limitation 10,120 562 Charitable contributions 2,122 3,243 Other 5,220 6,115 Total deferred income tax assets 290,803 328,135 Valuation allowance ( 4,601 ) ( 4,775 ) Net deferred tax assets 286,202 323,360 Deferred income tax liabilities: Property and equipment ( 245,396 ) ( 194,739 ) Amortization - Goodwill ( 60,230 ) ( 55,827 ) Amortization - Other intangibles ( 35,666 ) ( 29,482 ) Right of use assets ( 28,568 ) ( 29,004 ) Other ( 637 ) ( 3,116 ) Total deferred income tax liabilities ( 370,497 ) ( 312,168 ) Net deferred income tax (liabilities) assets $ ( 84,295 ) $ 11,192 The Company files federal, state and provincial income tax returns in various jurisdictions with varying statute of limitation expiration dates. Under the tax statute of limitations applicable to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations by the Internal Revenue Service for years before 2018. However, because the Company is carrying forward income tax attributes, such as net operating losses and tax credits from 2009 and subsequent years, these attributes can still be audited when utilized on returns filed in the future. The Company has determined that there are no positions currently taken that would rise to a level requiring an amount to be recorded or disclosed as an unrecognized tax benefit. If such positions do arise, it is the Company’s intent that any interest or penalty amount related to such positions will be recorded as a component of the income tax provision in the applicable period. The Company has federal tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $ 627.5 million as of December 31, 2022 and state net operating loss carryforwards spread across various jurisdictions with a combined total of approximately $ 634.5 million as of December 31, 2022. These net operating loss carryforwards, if not used to reduce taxable income in future periods, will begin to expire in 2030 and 2029 , for federal and state tax purposes, respectively. Realization of the deferred income tax assets, primarily arising from these net operating loss carryforwards and charitable contribution carryforwards, is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the carryforwards, which may include the reversal of deferred tax liability components. Through December 31, 2020, approximately $ 65.6 million of valuation allowances were established for some of the Company's deferred tax assets, which, based on its analysis at the time, the Company believed did not meet the “more likely than not” criteria and would expire before being realized in future periods. Based on the Company's assessment of the realizability of its deferred tax assets during the year ended December 31, 2021, which included a review of current and forecasted financial performance as the Company was in a cumulative pretax income position, the Company believed that some of these deferred tax assets met the “more likely than not” criteria and will be realized in future periods before they expire. As a result, the Company reversed its valuation allowances by approximately $ 60.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had a valuation allowance of approximately $ 4.8 million, net of federal tax benefit, on the Company’s deferred tax assets relating to state net operating losses, which, the Company believed did not meet the “more likely than not” criteria and would expire before being realized in future periods. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has a valuation allowance of approximately $ 4.6 million, net of federal tax benefit, on the deferred tax assets related to state net operating loss carryforwards. The Company’s valuation allowances, in part, rely on estimates and assumptions related to future financial performance. Given the macroeconomic environment related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the uncertainties regarding the related impact on financial performance, the Company’s valuation allowances may need to be adjusted in the future. F- 25 The Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) of 2022 was signed into law on August 16, 2022. This legislation includes a 15 % corporate alternative minimum tax and a 1 % excise tax on stock repurchases among its key tax provisions effective for years beginning after December 31, 2022. The Company is continuing to evaluate the existing guidance but does not anticipate a material impact for either of these provisions. The Company will continue to evaluate the impact of the IRA as additional information becomes available. The reconciliation between the statutory income tax rate and the Company’s effective income tax provision (benefit) rate for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, is as follows: 2022 2021 2020 Amount % Amount % Amount % (In thousands) Income tax at federal statutory rates $ 81,915 21.00 % $ 53,833 21.00 % $ ( 71,998 ) 21.00 % State taxes, net of federal benefit 17,103 4.38 12,070 4.71 ( 15,816 ) 4.61 Equity-based compensation ( 9,839 ) ( 2.52 ) ( 8,051 ) ( 3.14 ) ( 485 ) 0.14 Tax credits ( 205 ) ( 0.05 ) ( 137 ) ( 0.05 ) ( 304 ) 0.09 Impact of state rate changes 4,460 1.14 ( 753 ) ( 0.29 ) ( 3,906 ) 1.14 Officer's compensation limitation 4,612 1.18 3,437 1.34 95 ( 0.03 ) Valuation allowance - state — — ( 13,756 ) ( 5.37 ) 10,450 ( 3.05 ) Valuation allowance - federal — — ( 47,061 ) ( 18.36 ) 49,951 ( 14.57 ) Other 837 0.22 254 0.10 1,488 ( 0.43 ) Income tax provision (benefit) $ 98,883 25.35 % $ ( 164 ) ( 0.06 ) % $ ( 30,525 ) 8.90 % 14. LEASES The Company leases land, warehouse and office space, and equipment, which are classified as either operating or finance leases. The Company’s most significant lease is a long-term land lease with the City of San Diego covering approximately 190 acres, including approximately 17 acres of water in Mission Bay Park, California (the “Premises”). While there are no financial restrictions or covenants imposed by the Premises lease, there are certain operational restrictions in that the Premises must be used as a marine park facility and the Company may not operate another marine park facility within 560 miles of the City of San Diego. The lease term for the Premises ends in June 2048 and the annual rent under the lease is variable and calculated on the basis of a specified percentage of the Company’s gross income from the Premises (the “Percentage Rent”), or the minimum yearly rent (the “Minimum Rent”), whichever is greater. The required annual rent payments for the Premises is adjusted every three years to an amount equal to 80 % of the average accounting year rent actually paid for the three previous years, with the annual minimum rent calculated as approximately $ 10.4 million through each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. The Company is awaiting the City of San Diego’s confirmation of the new adjusted minimum yearly rent, which will be effective as of January 1, 2023. The annual rent payments may vary from the base rent due to a shift of seasonal performance results. Rent payments related to the Premises for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were approximately $ 13.6 million (including approximately $ 1.0 million remitted in 2022 related to 2021 and certain other fees), $ 11.1 million (including approximately $ 1.6 million remitted in 2021 related to 2020 Percentage Rent) and $ 0.5 million, respectively. The Company’s gross income from the Premises was significantly impacted during the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the temporary park closures, limited reopenings, modified operations and capacity restrictions resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related government restrictions in San Diego. Due to these factors, the Company deferred a payment of $ 8.3 million related to the Minimum Rent for the year ended December 31, 2020 (the “2020 Minimum Rent Payment”). As such, approximately $ 10.9 million and $ 10.8 million is included primarily in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, primarily related to the 2020 Minimum Rent Payment, the timing of the respective December rent payments, and certain accrued fees. Operating lease liabilities and long-term operating lease liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the lease maturities as of December 31, 2022 are not adjusted for these deferred payments.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company has commenced construction of certain new theme park attractions and other projects under contracts with various third parties. As of December 31, 2022 , excluding certain amounts related to the License Agreement with Sesame Workshop as described below, additional capital payments of approximately $ 219.6 million are necessary to complete these projects. The majority of these projects are expected to be completed in 2023 or 2024. License Agreements Pursuant to a license agreement (“License Agreement”) with Sesame Workshop, the Company pays a specified annual license fee, as well as a specified royalty based on revenues earned in connection with sales of licensed products, all food and beverage items utilizing the licensed elements and any events utilizing such elements if a separate fee is paid for such event. The Company’s principal commitments pursuant to the License Agreement include, among other items, the opening of a second standalone park (“Standalone Park”) (the Company opened the Standalone Park in San Diego on March 26, 2022) and minimum annual capital and marketing thresholds. After the opening of the second Standalone Park (counting the existing Sesame Place Standalone Park in Langhorne, Pennsylvania), SEA has the option to build additional Standalone Parks in the Sesame Territory within agreed upon timelines. The License Agreement has an initial term through December 31, 2031, with an automatic additional 15-year extension plus a five-year option added to the term of the License Agreement from December 31st of the year of each new Standalone Park opening. As of December 31, 2022, the Company estimates the combined remaining liabilities and obligations for the License Agreement commitments could be up to approximately $25.0 million over the remaining term of the agreement. See further discussion concerning royalty payments for the year 2021 in the Sesame Workshop Arbitration section which follows. ABI has granted the Company a perpetual, exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use the Busch Gardens trademark and certain related domain names in connection with the operation, marketing, promotion and advertising of certain of the Company’s theme parks, as well as in connection with the production, use, distribution and sale of merchandise sold in connection with such theme parks. Under the license, the Company is required to indemnify ABI against losses related to the use of the marks. Legal Proceedings Securities Class Action Lawsuit On June 14, 2018, a lawsuit captioned Highfields Capital I LP et al v. SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. et al, was filed in the United States District Court in the Southern District of California against the Company and certain of the Company’s former and present executive officers. The plaintiffs allege, among other things, that the Defendants made false and misleading statements in violation of the federal securities laws and Florida common law, regarding the impact of the film Blackfish on SeaWorld’s business. The complaint further alleges that such statements were made to induce Plaintiffs to purchase common stock of the Company at artificially-inflated prices and that Plaintiffs suffered investment losses as a result. In May 2022, the parties reached a resolution of F- 28 the matter, and the case has now been dismissed with prejudice. The full settlement amount is not considered material and was paid in the second quarter of 2022. Sesame Workshop Arbitration On February 4, 2022, Sesame Workshop delivered notice asserting that the Company failed to pay an additional royalty payment for 2021 under the License Agreement. The Company had previously recorded the additional amount claimed but disputes the application and calculation of the additional payment. The amount accrued is the Company’s best estimate and, at this time, the Company does not anticipate any exposure to loss in excess of amounts accrued to be material. On June 27, 2022, Sesame Workshop initiated arbitration pursuant to the License Agreement. The Company intends to vigorously defend its position. Other Lawsuits In October 2018, the Company received a demand letter from attorneys representing certain former employees who claim that the terms of their respective separation agreements entitle them to certain favorable modifications made to certain performance-vesting restricted shares (the “Tranche 3 Shares”) issued under the Company’s 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Plan”). In November 2020, the Company filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware an action for declaratory judgment seeking a determination that the threatened claims of the former employees are time-barred and without merit. In response, the defendant former employees filed a motion to dismiss or in the alternative to stay and compel arbitration. The parties agreed to arbitrate whether the former employees’ claims are subject to arbitration. On October 21, 2021, the arbitrator determined that disputes related to the former employees’ claims for the vesting of the Tranche 3 Shares are governed by the forum selection clauses of the equity award amendments rather than the Company’s dispute resolution process and notice of the arbitrator’s decision was filed with the Court of Chancery. On August 10, 2022, the defendant former employees filed answers, affirmative defenses and counterclaims. On October 10, 2022, the Company filed motions for judgment on the pleadings and to dismiss the counterclaims. The defendant former employees opposed the motions, on November 17, 2022, and the Company filed its reply brief on December 22, 2022. In terms of potential exposure, the value of the total shares at issue for these certain former employees depends largely upon the Company’s current share price, which fluctuates daily. Approximately 300,000 shares are at issue. The Company believes that the former employees’ claims are without merit and intends to defend vigorously its positions. While there can be no assurance regarding the ultimate outcome of this matter, the Company believes that any potential loss would not be material. On July 27, 2022, a purported class action was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against the Company captioned Quinton Burns individually and Next Friend of K.B., a minor v. SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc. and SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment LLC, Civil Case No. 2:22-cv-09941. The complaint states the putative class consists of Quinton Burns and K.B. Burns and similarly situated Black people. Plaintiffs then filed an amended complaint adding an additional seven adult and seven minor class representative plaintiffs in which they allege the class consists of themselves and similarly situated minority persons and also disclosed an additional 89 families and 125 children represented by Plaintiffs’ counsel who are allegedly members of the purported class (the ""First Amended Complaint""). The First Amended Complaint alleges the Company engaged in disparate treatment of Class members based on their race and in so doing violated the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and Pennsylvania common law. The First Amended Complaint seeks compensatory and punitive damages and attorneys’ fees and costs as well declarative and injunctive relief. The parties are engaged in discovery. The Company has filed a motion to dismiss all counts. The Company believes that the lawsuit is without merit and intends to defend the lawsuit vigorously. While there can be no assurance regarding the ultimate outcome of the litigation, the Company believes a potential loss, if any, would not be material. Other Matters The Company is a party to various other claims and legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business. In addition, from time to time the Company is subject to audits, inspections and investigations by, or receives requests for information from, various federal and state regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”), the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“Cal-OSHA”), the Florida Fish & Wildlife Commission (“FWC”), the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”), the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Other than those matters discussed above, from time to time, various parties also bring other lawsuits against the Company. Matters where an unfavorable outcome to the Company is probable and which can be reasonably estimated are accrued. Such accruals, which are not material for any period presented, are based on information known about the matters, the Company’s estimate of the outcomes of such matters, and the Company’s experience in contesting, litigating and settling similar matters. Matters that are considered reasonably possible to result in a material loss are not accrued for, but an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss is disclosed, if such amount or range can be determined. At this time, management does not expect any such known claims, legal proceedings or regulatory matters to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. F- 29 2020 Settled Matters In 2020, the Company received final court approval of a settlement for a previously disclosed stockholder class action lawsuit, captioned Baker v. SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc., et al. The settlement required the Company to pay $ 65.0 million for claims alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as the costs of administration and legal fees and expenses. The settlement does not include or constitute an admission, concession, or finding of any fault, liability, or wrongdoing by the Company or any defendant. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded $ 32.1 million of legal settlement charges, net of insurance recoveries, related to this case, in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). The full settlement amount was funded during the year ended December 31, 2020. In 2020, the Company received final court approval of a settlement for a previously disclosed putative derivative lawsuit captioned Kistenmacher v. Atchison, et al. The Company was a “Nominal Defendant” in the lawsuit. Pursuant to the settlement, the Company received $ 12.5 million of insurance proceeds from its insurers and adopted certain corporate governance modifications. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a legal settlement gain of $ 12.5 million related to insurance proceeds received in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). 16. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Of the Company’s long-term obligations as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Term B Loans are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and the First-Priority Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes are classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the Term B Loans approximates their carrying value, excluding unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts, due to the variable nature of the underlying interest rates and the frequent intervals at which such interest rates are reset. The fair value of the First-Priority Senior Secured Notes and Senior Notes was determined using quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments. See Note 11–Long-Term Debt for further details. The Company did no t have any assets measured on a recurring basis at fair value as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Company maintains its long-term liabilities at carrying value, net of unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts, in the consolidated balance sheet. The following table presents the Company’s estimated fair value measurements and related classifications for liabilities measured on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2022: Quoted Prices in Active Markets Significant for Identical Other Significant Assets and Observable Unobservable Balance at Liabilities Inputs Inputs December 31, (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) 2022 Liabilities: (In thousands) Long-term obligations (a) $ 873,675 $ 1,185,000 $ — $ 2,058,675 The following table presents the Company’s estimated fair value measurements and related classifications for liabilities measured on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2021: Quoted Prices in Active Markets Significant for Identical Other Significant Assets and Observable Unobservable Balance at Liabilities Inputs Inputs December 31, (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) 2021 Liabilities: (In thousands) Long-term obligations (a) $ 977,594 $ 1,197,000 $ — $ 2,174,594 F- 30 17. RETIREMENT PLAN The Company sponsors a defined contribution plan, under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company makes matching cash contributions, subject to certain restrictions, structured as a 50 % match on the first 4 % of eligible pay contributed by the employee. In April 2020, the Company matching contribution was temporarily suspended in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and remained suspended through 2021. During 2022, the Company reinstated the matching contribution effective January 1, 2022. The contribution will be made on an annual basis prior to March 31 of the following plan year for eligible employees. Employer matching contributions, net of forfeitures applied, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2020, totaled $ 0.4 million and $ 1.3 million, respectively, and is included in selling, general and administrative expenses and in operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). 18. EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION Equity compensation expense is included in operating expenses and in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) as follows: For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (In thousands) Equity compensation expense included in operating expenses $ 4,427 $ 9,578 $ 522 Equity compensation expense included in selling, general and administrative expenses 13,731 30,144 6,945 Total equity compensation expense $ 18,158 $ 39,722 $ 7,467 Equity compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2021, includes the impact of certain prior year performance vesting restricted awards which were previously not considered probable of vesting. Equity compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2020, includes the reversal of expense related to certain performance vesting restricted awards which at the time were no longer considered probable of vesting and also includes the reversal of expense related to outstanding unvested equity awards previously held by the Company’s former chief executive officer which were forfeited in connection with his departure. Total unrecognized equity compensation expense for all equity compensation awards probable of vesting as of December 31, 2022 was approximately $ 25.7 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years. The total fair value of shares which vested during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was approximately $ 21.8 million, $ 13.6 million and $ 12.7 million, respectively. The weighted average grant date fair value per share of time-vesting and performance-vesting restricted awards granted during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $ 58.08 , $ 52.12 and $ 15.85 per share, respectively. The activity related to the Company’s time-vesting and performance-vesting restricted awards during the year ended December 31, 2022 was as follows: Performance-Vesting Restricted Awards Time-Vesting Restricted Awards Bonus Performance Restricted Awards Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Awards Shares/Units Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value per Award Shares/Units Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value per Award Shares/Units Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value per Award Outstanding at December 31, 2021 938,020 $ 21.94 111,255 $ 51.78 990,003 $ 31.90 Granted 294,901 $ 53.53 134,063 $ 64.02 235,671 $ 60.40 Vested ( 666,294 ) $ 16.37 ( 119,867 ) $ 51.84 ( 160,008 ) $ 29.13 Forfeited ( 33,467 ) $ 45.40 ( 26,401 ) $ 63.44 ( 206,183 ) $ 36.26 Outstanding at December 31, 2022 533,160 $ 44.90 99,050 $ 65.16 859,483 $ 39.19 F- 31 The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was approximately $ 4.2 million, $ 9.5 million and $ 1.3 million, respectively. The activity related to the Company’s stock option awards during the year ended December 31, 2022 was as follows: Options Weighted Average Exercise Price Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Life (in years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in thousands) Outstanding at December 31, 2021 488,434 $ 30.59 Granted 192,078 $ 55.43 Forfeited ( 43,712 ) $ 47.37 Expired ( 2,007 ) $ 35.10 Exercised ( 121,081 ) $ 25.01 Outstanding at December 31, 2022 513,712 $ 39.75 7.24 $ 7,965 Exercisable at December 31, 2022 229,441 $ 24.85 5.06 $ 6,598 The weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted during the year ended December 31, 2022 was $ 33.13 . Key weighted-average assumptions utilized in the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model for stock options granted during the year ended December 31, 2022 were: Risk-free interest rate 2.81 % Expected volatility 61.90 % Expected dividend yield 0.00 % Expected life (years) (a) 6.12 Omnibus Incentive Plan The Company has reserved 15,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the Company’s Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Omnibus Incentive Plan”), of which approximately 7,290,000 are available for future issuance as of December 31, 2022. Bonus Performance Restricted Units During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company granted approximately 120,000 performance-vesting restricted units (the “Bonus Performance Restricted Units”) in accordance with its annual bonus plan for 2022 (the “2022 Bonus Plan”). The 2022 Bonus Plan provides for bonus awards payable 50 % in cash and 50 % in performance-vesting restricted units (the “Bonus Performance Restricted Units”) and is based upon the Company’s achievement of specified performance goals, including the achievement of certain cost targets, as defined by the 2022 Bonus Plan, with respect to the year ended December 31, 2022 (the “Fiscal 2022”). The total number of units eligible to vest into shares of stock is based on the level of achievement of the targets for Fiscal 2022 which ranges from 0 % (if below threshold performance), to 100 % (if at target performance) with opportunities to earn above 100% when achievement is above the target performance for certain metrics. In accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation , equity compensation expense is recorded on shares probable of vesting. Based on the Company’s actual Fiscal 2022 results with respect to specific performance goals, a portion of the outstanding performance-vesting restricted awards related to the Fiscal 2022 performance goals were considered probable of vesting as of December 31, 2022; therefore, equity compensation expense has been recorded related to these awards. These awards are expected to vest in accordance with their terms, at which time any unearned units will forfeit. The Company had previously granted performance-vesting restricted units which were eligible to vest based on the Company’s actual results for the year ended December 31, 2021. A portion of these units vested in 2022, and the remainder forfeited in accordance with their terms. Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company did not have an annual bonus plan for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020; however, based on a discretionary review of performance in light of the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business, the Compensation Committee determined to make discretionary equity awards to the Company’s bonus eligible employees during the year ended December 31, 2021. These awards were paid entirely in restricted stock units that vest 50 % each on the first and second anniversaries of the date of grant. The Company also had previously granted performance-vesting restricted units which were eligible to vest based on the Company’s actual results for the year ended December 31, 2019. A portion of these units vested in 2020, and the remaining portion vested in 2021 based on the employee’s continued employment on such vesting date and the remainder forfeited in accordance with their terms. F- 32 2022 Long-Term Incentive Awards During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company granted long-term incentive plan awards for 2022 (the “2022 Long-Term Incentive Grant”) which were comprised of approximately 55,000 nonqualified stock options (the “Long-Term Incentive Options”) and approximately 180,000 performance-vesting restricted units (the “Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Units”) (collectively, the “Long-Term Incentive Awards”). Long-Term Incentive Options The Long-Term Incentive Options vest over three years , with one-third vesting on each anniversary of the date of grant , subject to continued service through the applicable vesting date. Equity compensation expense for these options is recognized for each tranche over the vesting period using the straight-line method. Upon stock option exercises, authorized but unissued shares are issued by the Company. Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Units The Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Units are eligible to vest during the three-year performance period beginning on January 1, 2022 and ending on December 31, 2024 (or, extended through December 31, 2025, as applicable) (the “Performance Period”) based upon the Company’s achievement of specified performance goals during the Performance Period. The total number of Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Units eligible to vest will be based on the level of achievement of the performance goals and ranges from 0 % (if below threshold performance) up to 150 % (for maximum performance). Upon achievement of at least the threshold performance goals, 50% of the award for a given level of performance will vest, with the remaining 50% subject to a one-year performance test period. Performance for the test period must meet or exceed the prior year’s performance before up to the remaining 50 % of the units can be earned. The Company recognizes equity compensation expense for its performance-vesting restricted awards ratably over the related performance period, if the performance condition is probable of being achieved. If the probability of vesting changes for performance-vesting restricted awards in a subsequent period, all equity compensation expense related to those awards that would have been recorded, if any, over the requisite service period had the new percentage been applied from inception, will be recorded as a cumulative catch-up or reduction at such subsequent date. Other Long-Term Incentive Awards During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company also granted time-vesting restricted units and options to certain employees which generally vest over three years , with one-third vesting on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date. Previous Long-Term Incentive Awards The Company also has outstanding time-vesting restricted awards (the “Long-Term Incentive Time Restricted Awards”), performance-vesting restricted awards (the “Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Awards”) and nonqualified stock options granted under previous long-term incentive plan grants. During the year ended December 31, 2022, a portion of the previously granted Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Awards related to completed performance periods vested, with the remainder forfeiting in accordance with their terms. The remaining outstanding Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Awards related to future performance periods are eligible to vest based upon the Company’s achievement of pre-established performance goals for the respective performance period, as defined. A portion of the outstanding Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Awards relate to performance restricted units (the “2019 LTIP Performance Awards”) which contain a four-year performance period consisting of the 2019-2022 calendar years (or, extended through the end of the 2023 calendar year, as applicable) and are eligible to vest based upon the Company’s achievement of specific performance goals for the performance period, as defined, with an opportunity to vest up to 50% of the award earlier if certain goals are achieved in any fiscal year during the performance period. The total number of 2019 LTIP Performance Awards eligible to vest will be based on the level of achievement of the performance goals and ranges from 0 % (if below threshold performance) up to 100 % (for target or above performance). Upon achievement of the performance goals, up to 50% of the award for a given level of performance will vest, with the remaining 50% subject to a one-year extended performance test period. The goal achieved must be met again or exceeded for the extended performance period before the remaining units are earned. Based on the Company’s results for fiscal year 2021, the Company vested a portion of the 2019 LTIP Performance Awards in the first quarter of 2022. Additionally, based on the Company’s results for fiscal year 2022, the Company expects to vest another portion of the 2019 LTIP Performance Awards in the first quarter of 2023. F- 33 Other During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company granted equity awards to its non-employee members of its Board which will vest on the day before the Company’s next annual meeting. Each eligible Board member elected the form of their equity award as either deferred stock units (“DSUs”) or restricted stock units (“RSUs”). Each DSU granted represents the right to receive one share of the Company’s common stock three months after the respective director leaves the Board. Upon vesting, each RSU will be converted into one share of the Company’s common stock. Additionally, during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company granted equity awards in the form of RSUs or DSUs which vested immediately to each eligible Board member in lieu of quarterly cash payments related to the director’s annual retainers. 19.

F- 37 SEAWORLD ENTERTAINMENT, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED PARENT COMPANY ONLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. DESCRIPTION OF SEAWORLD ENTERTAINMENT, INC. SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. (the “Parent”) was incorporated in Delaware on October 2, 2009. See further discussion in Note 1–Description of the Business in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The Parent has no operations or significant assets or liabilities other than its investment in SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc. (“SEA”), which owns and operates twelve theme parks within the United States. Accordingly, the Parent is dependent upon distributions from SEA to fund its obligations. However, under the terms of SEA’s various debt agreements, SEA’s ability to pay dividends or lend to the Parent is restricted, except that SEA may pay specified amounts to the Parent to fund the payment of the Parent’s tax obligations. The COVID-19 pandemic materially impacted operations for SEA for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. See further discussion relating to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Note 1–Description of the Business in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION The accompanying condensed financial statements (the “parent company only financial statements”) include the accounts of the Parent and its investment in SEA accounted for in accordance with the equity method and do not present the financial statements of the Parent and its subsidiary on a consolidated basis. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted since this information is included with the SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “consolidated financial statements”). These parent company only financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements. 3. GUARANTEES SEA is the borrower under the senior secured credit facilities, (the “Senior Secured Credit Facilities”) under a credit agreement dated as of December 1, 2009 which was amended and restated on August 25, 2021 (the “Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”). On August 25, 2021, SEA completed a private offering of $ 725.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.250 % senior notes due 2029 (the “Senior Notes”). On April 30, 2020, SEA closed on a private offering of $ 227.5 million aggregate principal amount of 8.750 % first-priority senior secured notes due 2025 (the “First-Priority Senior Secured Notes”). On August 5, 2020, SEA closed on a private offering of $ 500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9.500 % second-priority senior secured notes due 2025 (the “Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes”), which were fully redeemed during the year ended December 31, 2021. Under the terms of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the obligations of SEA are fully, unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by Parent, any subsidiary of Parent that directly or indirectly owns 100 % of the issued and outstanding equity interest of SEA, and subject to certain exceptions, each of SEA’s existing and future material domestic wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the “Guarantors”). SEA’s obligations under the Senior Notes and related indenture are guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior secured basis, by the Guarantors, as defined, in accordance with the provisions of the indenture. The First-Priority Senior Secured Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent, any subsidiary of the Parent that directly or indirectly owns 100 % of the issued and outstanding equity interests of SEA, and subject to certain exceptions, each of SEA’s subsidiaries that guarantees SEA’s existing senior secured credit facilities. See Note 11–Long-Term Debt of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further details. 4. DIVIDENDS FROM SUBSIDIARY During the year ended December 31, 2022, SEA paid dividends to the Parent of approximately $ 693.6 million. The dividends were in the form of 12,423,497 shares of common stock repurchased by SEA. During the year ended December 31, 2021, SEA paid dividends to the Parent of approximately $ 215.7 million. The dividends were in the form of 3,692,794 shares of common stock repurchased by SEA (see Note 5–Stockholders’ Deficit which follows). During the year ended December 31, 2020, SEA paid dividends to the Parent of approximately $ 12.4 million. The dividends were in the form of payments that SEA made for share repurchases at the Parent level (see Note 5–Stockholders’ Deficit which follows). During the year ended December 31, 2020, Parent paid accumulated dividends, net of forfeitures, related to shares that carried dividend rights from previous dividend declarations which vested during the year. F- 38 5. STOCKHOLDERS’ DEFICIT Omnibus Incentive Plan The Parent has reserved 15,000,000 shares of common stock for future issuance under the Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Omnibus Incentive Plan”), of which approximately 7,290,000 are available for future issuance as of December 31, 2022. The Omnibus Incentive Plan is administered by the compensation committee of the Parent’s Board, and provides that the Parent may grant equity incentive awards to eligible employees, directors, consultants or advisors of the Parent or its subsidiary, SEA, in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other stock-based and performance compensation awards. If an award under the Omnibus Incentive Plan expires or is canceled, forfeited, or terminated, without issuance to the participant, the unissued shares may be granted again under the Omnibus Incentive Plan. See further discussion in Note 18–Equity-Based Compensation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, Parent transferred approximately $ 3.4 million, $ 6.0 million and $ 2.6 million in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options to SEA as a capital contribution and increased its investment in SEA.

In March 2022, the Parent's Board approved a replenishment to the Former Share Repurchase Program of $ 228.2 million, bringing the total amount authorized back up to $ 250.0 million at that time. Under the Former Share Repurchase Program, during the year ended December 31, 2022, the Parent repurchased 3,563,086 shares for an aggregate total of approximately $ 250.0 million, leaving no amount remaining under the Former Share Repurchase Program. In May 2022, the Parent's Board approved a $ 250.0 million share repurchase program (the “May Share Repurchase Program”). Under the May Share Repurchase Program, during the year ended December 31, 2022, the Parent repurchased 5,085,752 shares for an aggregate total of approximately $ 250.0 million, leaving no amount remaining under the May Share Repurchase Program. In August 2022, the Parent's Board approved a new $ 250.0 million share repurchase program (the “Share Repurchase Program”). Under the Share Repurchase Program, during the year ended December 31, 2022, the Parent repurchased 3,774,659 shares for an aggregate total of approximately $ 193.6 million, leaving approximately $ 56.4 million available under the Share Repurchase Program as of December 31, 2022. Collectively, as a result of the repurchase programs disclosed above, the Parent has repurchased a combined total of 12,423,497 shares for an aggregate combined total of approximately $ 693.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Parent repurchased 3,692,794 shares for an aggregate total of approximately $ 215.7 million leaving approximately $ 21.8 million available under the Former Share Repurchase Program as of December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2020, prior to the COVID-19 temporary park closures, the Parent repurchased 469,785 shares for an aggregate total of approximately $ 12.4 million under the Former Share Repurchase Program. Under the Share Repurchase Program, the Parent is authorized to repurchase shares through open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans and under Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. The Share Repurchase Program has no time limits and could be suspended or discontinued completely at any time. All shares repurchased pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program, along with shares repurchased directly from selling stockholders concurrently with previous secondary offerings, are recorded as treasury stock at a total cost of $ 1,324.7 million and $ 631.1 million as of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 , respectively, and are reflected within stockholders’ deficit in the accompanying condensed balance sheets.

Business Company Overview We are a leading theme park and entertainment company providing experiences that matter and inspiring guests to protect animals and the wild wonders of our world. We own or license a portfolio of recognized brands including SeaWorld, Busch Gardens, Aquatica, Discovery Cove and Sesame Place. Over our more than 60-year history, we have developed a diversified portfolio of 12 differentiated theme parks that are grouped in key markets across the United States. Many of our theme parks showcase our one-of-a-kind zoological collection and feature a diverse array of both thrill and family-friendly rides, educational presentations, shows and/or other attractions with broad demographic appeal which deliver memorable experiences and a strong value proposition for our guests. We generate revenue primarily from selling admission to our theme parks and from purchases of food, merchandise and other items, primarily within our theme parks. For more information concerning our results from operations, see the “ Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As one of the world’s foremost zoological organizations and a global leader in animal welfare, training, husbandry, veterinary care and marine animal rescue, we are committed to helping protect and preserve the oceans, environment and the natural world. For more information, see the “—Our Culture and Social Responsibility” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Recent Developments Impact of Global COVID-19 Pandemic Our results of operations for 2020 and 2021 were impacted by the global COVID-19 pandemic due in part to the following factors: (i) capacity limitations, modified/limited operations and/or temporary park closures which were in place for portions of the respective periods; (ii) decreased demand due to public concerns associated with the pandemic; (iii) restrictions on international travel; and (iv) a decline in both international and group-related attendance. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and in compliance with government restrictions, we temporarily closed all of our theme parks effective March 16, 2020. Beginning in June 2020, we began the phased reopening of some of our parks with enhanced health, safety and cleaning measures, capacity limitations and/or modified/limited operations, which at times included reduced hours and/or reduced operating days. By the end of August 2020, we had reopened 10 of our 12 parks on a limited basis. We did not open our Aquatica water park in California or our Water Country USA water park in Virginia for the 2020 operating season but opened both parks for their 2021 operating season. At the start of 2021, seven of our 12 parks were open but were operating with capacity limitations or modified/limited operations. By the end of the second quarter of 2021, all of our 12 parks were open, and operating without COVID-19 related capacity limitations. We continue to monitor guidance from, and engage with, federal, state and local authorities and may adjust our plans accordingly. The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a material impact on our financial results. See further discussion in the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and the “ Risk Factors” sections included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Current Operating Environment Our Board has formed a number of committees designed to provide further assistance from Board members with expertise in certain areas by providing enhanced oversight over the operations of the Company. As a result, in the current operating environment, certain members of our Board, including our Chairman of the Board, are actively involved in overseeing certain key operating activities. The current condition of the overall labor market, the challenging current operating environment and COVID-19 related factors has led to increased turnover and challenges in meeting our staffing goals. These staffing challenges have also led to wage pressures in 2021. Staffing challenges and inflationary pressures in general could continue in this environment; however, we continue our efforts to recruit and retain talent and identify cost reduction and efficiency opportunities as well as incremental revenue opportunities to help offset cost pressures. For further discussion relating to strategic measures we have taken to operate in the current environment, see Note 1–Description of the Business in the notes in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For other factors concerning the current operating environment and the COVID-19 pandemic, see the “ Risk Factors ” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “ The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our business and could adversely affect our results of operations and/or various other factors beyond our control could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations ” and “ If we fail to hire and/or retain employees, our business may be adversely affected ”. 3 During 2021, we began year-round operations at SeaWorld San Antonio and began to operate on select days on a year round basis at both Busch Gardens Williamsburg and Sesame Place in Pennsylvania. These parks are open primarily on weekend s and holidays during the winter season, weather permitting . Our Competitive Strengths • Brands That Consumers Know and Love. We believe our brands attract and appeal to guests from around the world. We use our brands, intellectual property and the work we do to care for animals to increase awareness of our theme parks, drive attendance to our theme parks and create “out-of-park” experiences for our guests as a way to connect with them before they visit our theme parks and to stay connected with them after their visit. Such experiences include various consumer product offerings, including toys, books, apparel, educational tools and technology accessories as well as our websites and advertisements. • Differentiated Theme Parks. We own and operate 12 theme parks which deliver high-quality educational experiences, entertainment offerings, aesthetic appeal, and shopping and dining experiences. Our portfolio includes theme parks ranked among the most highly attended in the industry, including three of the top 20 theme parks and four of the top 10 water parks in North America, as measured by attendance ( TEA/AECOM 2019 Report ). Our combined theme park portfolio has over 650 attractions that appeal to guests of all ages, including 79 animal habitats, 121 programs and 190 rides. In addition, we have over 350 restaurants, photo and specialty retail shops. Our theme parks appeal to the entire family and offer a broad range of experiences, ranging from educational animal encounters and presentations, to thrilling rides and exciting shows. In fact, we have won numerous awards and recognition. See further details in our theme park portfolio table located in the Our Theme Parks section which follows. • Diversified Business Portfolio. Our portfolio of theme parks is diversified in a number of important respects. Our theme parks are located in geographic clusters across the United States, which at times can help protect us from the impact of localized events. Many of our theme parks showcase a different mix of thrill-oriented and family friendly attractions including rides, educational presentations and/or shows. This varied portfolio of offerings attracts guests from a broad range of demographics and geographies. Our portfolio of theme parks appeal to both regional and destination guests, which provide us with a diversified attendance base. • One of the World’s Largest Zoological Collections. We provide care for what we believe is one of the world’s largest zoological collections. We believe we are attractively positioned in the industry due to our highly unique zoological collection and ability to present our animals in a differentiated, interactive and educational manner. Through opportunities to explore and interact with these amazing animals in our parks, each year we educate millions of guests with the goal of inspiring them to care and protect animals and their habitats in the wild. Our commitment to these animals includes applying world-class standards of care while striving to provide habitats that promote their health. We also lead, partner with and/or sponsor research efforts that have provided and will continue to provide essential information and tools to help protect and sustain species in their natural habitats around the world. See the “— Conservation & Community Relations ” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. • Strong Competitive Position. Our competitive position is enhanced by the combination of our powerful brands, extensive zoological collection and expertise and attractive in-park assets located on valuable real estate. Our zoological collection and expertise, which have evolved over our six decades of caring for animals, would be extremely difficult and expensive to replicate. We have made extensive investments in new attractions and infrastructure and we believe that our theme parks are well capitalized (see the “— Capital Improvements” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of our new rides and attractions). We believe that the limited supply of real estate suitable for theme park development in the United States coupled with high initial capital investment, long development lead-times and zoning and other land use restrictions constrain the number of large theme parks that can be constructed. • Proven and Experienced Management Team and Employees with Specialized Animal Expertise. Our senior management team, led by Marc Swanson, our Chief Executive Officer, has an average tenure of approximately 14 years in relevant industries. The management team is comprised of highly skilled and dedicated professionals with wide ranging experience in theme park operations, zoological operations, product and business development, hospitality, finance and accounting. Additionally, our animal care team is among the most experienced and qualified in the world, making us a global leader in animal welfare, husbandry, enrichment, and veterinary care. 4 • Proximity of Complementary Theme Parks. Our theme parks are grouped in key locations near large population centers and/or tourism destinations across the United States, which allows us to realize revenue and operating expense efficiencies. Having complementary theme parks located within close proximity to each other also enables us to cross market and offer bundled ticket and vacation packages. In addition, closely located theme parks provide operating efficiencies including sales, marketing, procurement and administrative synergies as overhead expenses are shared among the theme parks within each region. • Significant Cash Flow Generation. We believe that our disciplined approach to capital expenditures, cost management and working capital management historically has enabled us to generate significant annual operating cash flow, even in years of declining performance. In addition, some of our parks are open year-round, which has helped reduce seasonal cash flow volatility. Due to the temporary park closures and limited reopenings, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our cash flow in 2020 was materially impacted. See the seasonality discussion in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. • Care for Our Community and the Natural World. We are committed to the communities in which our theme parks are located and focus our philanthropic efforts in three areas: animal preservation and stewardship; youth development and education; and community initiatives that address environmental sustainability. Our theme parks inspire and educate children and guests of all ages through experiences that are educational, fun and meaningful. Additionally, our Sesame Place park was the first theme park in the world to have achieved the designation of Certified Autism Center from the International Board of Credentialing and Continuing Education Standards (the “IBCCES”). In 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we provided complimentary distance learning resources for students, teachers and parents to use as schools shifted to virtual classrooms. These resources included standards-aligned classroom activities, teacher’s guides, videos, and animal information books. By providing these distance learning resources, we were able to help families explore, discover, and stay connected virtually in a fun and inspiring environment even while our parks were temporarily closed. We also partner with charities across the country whose values and missions are aligned with our own by providing financial support, in-kind resources, strategic guidance, and/or hands-on volunteer work. For example, we are one of the primary supporters and a corporate member of the SeaWorld & Busch Gardens Conservation Fund, a non-profit conservation foundation, which makes grants to wildlife research and conservation projects that protect wildlife and wild places worldwide. In addition, we operate one of the world’s most respected rescue programs for ill and injured marine animals, in collaboration with federal, state and local governments, and other members of accredited stranding networks, among others, with the goal of rehabilitating and returning them to the wild. Over our history, our animal experts have helped almost 39,900 ill, injured, orphaned and abandoned wild animals. We are committed to animal rescue, conservation research and education and invest millions annually in these efforts. Our Theme Parks Our legacy started in 1959 with the opening of our first Busch Gardens theme park in Tampa, Florida. Since then, we have grown our portfolio of strong brands and strategically expanded across five states on approximately 2,000 acres of owned land and 190 acres of leased property in San Diego. Our theme parks offer guests a variety of exhilarating experiences, from animal encounters that invite exploration and appreciation of the natural world, to both thrilling and family-friendly rides, educational presentations and spectacular shows. Our theme parks also provide guests special events and concerts throughout the year, including our Seven Seas Food Festivals, Food & Wine Festivals, Sesame Street Kids’ Weekends, Viva La Musica music celebration, and Craft Beer Festivals as well as special seasonal events such as our Halloween Spooktacular, Howl-O-Scream and Christmas events. Our theme parks are consistently recognized among the top theme parks in the world and rank among the most highly attended in the industry. See further discussion of our recent awards and recognition in the theme park portfolio table which follows. Also see a discussion of our new rides and attractions under the Capital Improvements section. We generally locate our theme parks in geographic clusters, which we believe improves our ability to serve guests by providing them with a varied, comprehensive vacation experience and valuable multi-park pricing packages, as well as improving our operating efficiency through shared overhead costs. Our portfolio of branded theme parks includes the following names (see the theme park portfolio table which follows for more details on each of these parks): • SeaWorld. SeaWorld is widely recognized as the leading marine-life theme park brand in the world. Our SeaWorld theme parks rank among the most highly attended theme parks in the industry and offer up-close interactive experiences, educational presentations, special dining experiences, thrilling attractions and a variety of educational and entertainment offerings that immerse guests in the marine-life theme. We also offer our guests numerous animal encounters, including the opportunity to work with trainers and feed marine animals, as well as themed thrill and family-friendly rides and entertainment that creatively incorporate our one-of-a-kind zoological collection. We currently own and operate the following SeaWorld-branded theme parks: 5 • SeaWorld San Diego is the original SeaWorld theme park and was founded in 1964 by four graduates from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).

We currently own and operate the following Busch Gardens theme parks: • Busch Gardens Tampa Bay is open year-round and features exotic animals, shows and both thrill and family-friendly rides on 306 acres of lush natural landscape. The zoological collection is a popular attraction for families, and the portfolio of rides broaden the theme park’s appeal to teens and thrill seekers of all ages. In 2019, Busch Gardens Tampa Bay opened Tigris , a triple launch steel coaster that catapults riders forward and backward. Busch Gardens Tampa Bay is ranked among the top 20 theme parks in North America, as measured by attendance ( TEA/AECOM 2019 Report ). • Busch Gardens Williamsburg, a 422-acre theme park, is regularly recognized as one of the highest quality theme parks in the world, capturing dozens of awards over its history for attraction and show quality, design, landscaping, culinary operations and theming. Busch Gardens Williamsburg is home to a number of thrilling roller coasters and attractions including Finnegan’s Flyer which opened in 2019. • Aquatica. Our Aquatica-branded water parks are premium, family-oriented destinations in a South Seas-themed tropical setting. Aquatica water parks build on the aquatic theme of our SeaWorld brand and feature high-energy rides, water attractions, white-sand beaches and an innovative presentation of marine animals. We position our Aquatica water parks as companions to our SeaWorld theme parks and currently own and operate the following separately gated Aquatica branded theme parks: • Aquatica Orlando is an 81-acre South Seas-themed water park adjacent to SeaWorld Orlando that is open year-round. The water park features state-of-the-art attractions for guests of all ages and swimming abilities, including some that pass by or through animal habitats.

In 2020, prior to the temporary park closure, Aquatica San Antonio opened Tonga Twister, a high energy body slide, and in 2019, the park opened Ihu’s Breakaway Falls, a multi-drop tower slide. Aquatica San Antonio is ranked #8 most attended water park in North America ( TEA/AECOM 2019 Report ). • Aquatica San Diego is a 66-acre water park located in Chula Vista, California, near our SeaWorld San Diego theme park. The water park features a variety of waterslides, a lazy river, a wave pool with a large beach area and private cabanas. We are converting Aquatica San Diego into a Sesame Place standalone park which we expect to open in March 2022. Sesame Place San Diego will be the second Sesame Place in the country and the first located on the West Coast. The park will feature an interactive Sesame Street Neighborhood, where kids can play with immersive physical and digital character experiences. Guests will also have exciting ways to engage with Sesame Street characters, including a live character show, a daily parade and one-of-a-kind photo opportunities. In addition to ongoing park offerings, the park will open with a full lineup of exciting family-friendly events and seasonal celebrations throughout the year. 6 • Discovery Cove. Located next to SeaWorld Orlando, Discovery Cove is a 58-acre, reservations only, all-inclusive marine life theme park that is open year-round and features premium culinary offerings. The theme park restricts its attendance in order to assure a more intimate experience. Discovery Cove provides guests with a full day of activities, including the opportunity to interact with dolphins and sharks, snorkel with thousands of tropical fish, wade in a lush lagoon with stingrays and hand-feed birds in a free flight aviary.

( h ) The total number of animal habitats, rides, shows, presentations, events, distinctive experiences and play areas in our theme park portfolio varies seasonally. Capital Improvements We make annual targeted investments to support our existing theme park facilities and attractions, as well as enable the development of new theme park attractions and infrastructure. Maintaining and improving our theme parks, as well as opening new attractions, is critical to remain competitive, grow revenue and increase our guests’ length of stay. In order to manage costs and expenditures and to maximize liquidity in response to the temporary park closures and limited reopenings related to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, we substantially reduced or deferred all capital expenditures starting in March 2020 (other than minimal essential capital expenditures) when the parks were closed and postponed the opening of certain rides that were still under construction and originally scheduled to open in 2020. We were able to open certain new attractions in 2020 prior to the park closures including our award-winning Texas Stingray coaster at SeaWorld San Antonio . In 2021, we opened Riptide Race at Aquatica Orlando. Our strong lineup of attractions scheduled to open in 2022 includes 4 of the 9 most anticipated roller coasters of 2022 (USA Today, 2021). We expect to open the following new rides and attractions in our parks in 2022: • Ice Breaker (SeaWorld Orlando): A quadruple launch coaster, featuring four airtime filled launches, both backwards and forwards, culminating in a reverse launch up a 93-foot vertical spike leading to the steepest beyond vertical drop in Florida. • Iron Gwazi (Busch Gardens Tampa Bay): The tallest hybrid coaster in North America and the world’s fastest and steepest hybrid coaster, with the world’s tallest drop. Riders will climb more than 200 feet before plunging into a beyond vertical drop, reaching speeds of 76 miles per hour, and experiencing a dozen airtime moments. • Emperor (SeaWorld San Diego): The tallest, fastest, longest and first floorless dive coaster on the West Coast. After climbing more than 150 feet, riders will dangle at a 90-degree angle before plunging into a 143-foot vertical drop that will accelerate riders to more than 60 miles per hour. • Tidal Surge (SeaWorld San Antonio): The world’s tallest and fastest Screaming Swing will take riders up 135 feet at speeds reaching 68 miles per hour. • Pantheon (Busch Gardens Williamsburg): The world’s fastest multi-launch coaster, will accelerate riders to a speed of 73 miles per hour and will include a 180-foot drop at 95-degrees, four launches, two inversions, and 15 air-time moments. • Reef Plunge (Aquatica Orlando): A new water slide experience that will take riders through over 330 feet of translucent cutouts and rings all while sliding past a dynamic new underwater habitat home to Commerson’s dolphins and leopard sharks. • Riptide Race (Aquatica San Antonio): A dueling pipeline slide that will send riders through over 500 feet of slide all while navigating high-speed tunnels and tight turns alongside their opponents. 9 • Rapids Racer and Wahoo Remix (Adventure Island): Rapids Racer is a dueling pipeline slide that will send riders racing through nearly 600 feet of slide all while navigating tight turns and accelerations alongside their opponents. Wahoo Remix (formerly Wahoo Run ) will re-open as a family raft ride sending riders along a more than 600 -foot slide complete with synchronized light and sound elements and a glow-light tunnel. • Aquazoid Amped (Water Country USA): This new water slide experience includes an all-new special effects show, music and dynamic lighting effects. Riders will plunge down over 800 feet of fully enclosed twisting tube at speeds of around 20 feet per second. • Big Bird’s Tour Bus (Sesame Place): The whole family will enjoy a ride on this oversized, red double-decker bus with Big Bird and some of his furry friends. The bus goes around and around with a Sesame Street-inspired cityscape as the backdrop. • Sesame Place San Diego (formerly Aquatica San Diego): The 17-acre theme park is expected to open in March 2022 at the former site of Aquatica San Diego . It will boast seven themed dry rides and an interactive musical play area. This is in addition to 11 water attractions including a 500,000-gallon wave pool, as well as an interactive Sesame Street Neighborhood. Ride Conservation Partnerships We are pleased to announce partnerships with the following conservation organizations in conjunction with our new and planned rides, including: the Alaska SeaLife Center on our new Ice Breaker ride which will highlight animal rescue and climate change in the Arctic region; Penguins International on our new Emperor ride which will focus on penguin awareness and conservation; and the Wilderness Foundation Africa on our new Iron Gwazi ride which will highlight the plight of endangered African wildlife. Safety, Maintenance and Inspection Safety is of utmost importance to us. Maintenance at our theme parks is a key component of safety and guest service and includes two areas of focus: (i) facilities and infrastructure and (ii) rides and attractions. Facilities and infrastructure maintenance consists of all functions associated with upkeep, repair, preventative maintenance, code compliance and improvement of theme park infrastructure. This area is staffed with a combination of external contractors/suppliers and our employees. Rides and attractions maintenance represents all functions dedicated to the inspection, upkeep, repair and testing of guest experiences, particularly rides. Rides and attractions maintenance is also staffed with a combination of external suppliers, inspectors, and our employees, who work to assure that ride experiences are operating within, and that maintenance is conducted according to, the manufacturer’s criteria, internal standards, industry best practice and standards (such as ASTM International, formerly known as the American Society for Testing and Materials), state or jurisdictional requirements, as well as the ride designer or manufacturer’s specifications. All ride maintenance personnel are trained to perform their duties according to internal training processes, in addition to recognized industry certification programs for maintenance leadership. Every ride at our theme parks is inspected regularly, according to daily, weekly, monthly, and annual schedules, by both park maintenance experts and external consultants. Additionally, all rides are inspected daily by maintenance personnel before use by guests to ensure proper and safe operation. A networked enterprise software system is used to plan and track various maintenance activities, in order to schedule and request work, track completion progress and manage costs of parts and materials. In addition to our day-to-day maintenance and inspection practices for the existing rides in our parks, before new rides are introduced to our guests, an extensive review of the ride, from design through installation, is conducted by the ride manufacturer, internal technical and operational experts, local authorities, as well as competent third party inspectors and engineers. Additionally, all new rides are analyzed according to a standardized, internal evaluation and acceptance process, which reviews, among other things, that the new ride operates safely and as intended, that the associated site and facility requirements for the ride operation are met, that the appropriate training of our employees is conducted, and that operational and maintenance procedures are documented. Environmental and Social Responsibility As a purpose-driven company, our culture is built on our mission to provide experiences that matter for our guests and, in many of our parks, inspiring our guests to protect animals and the wild wonders of our world. Our management team and our employees, often referred to as ambassadors, are committed to social responsibility and strive to connect people to nature and animals and to do so in a socially responsible manner. We create an environment in our theme parks, where each guest can explore a diverse range of experiences meant to inspire and motivate them to join us in protecting animals and our planet. Our purpose and focus on creating experiences that matter for our guests are integral to our organization and the cornerstone of our success. 10 Animal Care and Rescue We provide care for one of the largest zoological collections in the world. Our commitment to these animals includes applying world-class standards of care, while striving to provide habitats that promote the health of the animals. During our temporary park closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, essential personnel, including our animal care experts, continued to provide for the health, safety, and nutritional needs of all of the animals in our care. Our animal care team is among the most experienced and qualified in the world, making SeaWorld a global leader in animal welfare, husbandry, enrichment, and veterinary care. The zoological programs of all three SeaWorld parks, Discovery Cove and Busch Gardens Tampa Bay are validated by several professional zoological assessing organizations. Our parks are accredited members of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (“AZA”), one of the foremost professional zoological organizations in the world. In addition, our three SeaWorld parks and Discovery Cove are accredited by the Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums (“AMMPA”), an association specifically focused on the care of marine mammals. SeaWorld’s facilities have also received accreditation from the International Marine Animal Trainers’ Association (“IMATA”), whose Animal Trainer Development Program was developed to recognize those facilities that have exceptional systems for training animal care givers in the science and art of animal training, while utilizing positive reinforcement. And lastly, all three SeaWorld parks, Aquatica Orlando, Discovery Cove and Busch Gardens Tampa Bay are Certified Humane by Humane Conservation, an animal welfare certification standard developed by the independent third-party organization American Humane. We take a comprehensive approach to ensuring the health and welfare of the animals in our care that focuses on physical, behavioral and population health. Our animal care team includes board-certified veterinarians, technicians, and animal care experts, and we have onsite animal hospitals at each SeaWorld park and a guest-facing, state-of-the-art Animal Care Center at our Busch Gardens park in Tampa, Florida. We have also been at the forefront of advancing understanding and best practice-related behavioral health in animals. We are committed to caring for each individual animal, and to being responsible stewards of our animal populations, including ensuring that we maintain the genetic diversity needed for healthy and self-sustaining populations. We have invested significantly in developing leading-edge reproductive health expertise, technologies, and capabilities. Our focus on population health is also driven by our goal of helping to support, and our participation in, Species Survival Plans, which are ultimately aimed at preserving species in the wild. We apply high quality and comprehensive animal care standards, and actively work to advance knowledge and improve standards. We do this by contributing to research and sharing our insights with other zoological organizations around the world. For example, our continued work to define the clinically normal, healthy ranges for key measures in marine animals in our parks has helped to establish and refine the standards used by many veterinarians to assess both wild and managed marine species. This ongoing research also includes defining the basic biology and physiology of animals in our population. The combined results of these continued research efforts have provided and will continue to provide essential information and tools to help formulate plans to protect species in their natural habitats. We are also a leader in animal rescue. Working in partnership with state, local and federal agencies, our rescue teams are on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year, including during our temporary park closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Consistent with our mission to protect animals and their ecosystems, our rescue teams mobilize and often travel hundreds of miles to help ill, injured, orphaned or abandoned wild animals in need of our expert care, with the goal of returning then to their natural habitat. Over our history, we have helped almost 39,900 animals across a number of species including bottlenose dolphins, manatees, sea lions, seals, sea turtles, sharks, birds and more. For example, we work closely with Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission (the “FWC”) and in the past five years have helped over 250 manatees as human caused pressures increase. We have one of the largest manatee rescue operations in the world and operate one of only five manatee critical care facilities in the U.S. Our commitment to animals also extends beyond our theme parks and throughout the world. We actively participate in species conservation and rescue efforts as discussed in the “— Conservation & Community Relations ” section which follows. Conservation and Community Relations Our purpose is to inspire people to protect animals and the wild wonders of the world, and a critical way we deliver on this is by providing our guests opportunities to explore and interact with the animals in our parks. Through our up-close animal encounters, educational exhibits, “Inside Look” events, educational presentations, and innovative entertainment, we strive to inspire each guest to take action to care for and conserve the natural world. Some of the animals in our care serve as ambassadors for their species through public appearances that educate the public and raise awareness for issues facing wildlife and wild places. We also partner with and support leading research, education and conservation organizations that help protect species of animals at risk in the wild, as well as the habitats that are home to many vulnerable species. For example, we are working alongside various resource management agencies, including the FWC, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries, the Fish and Wildlife Foundation of Florida, and other zoological facilities, to save Florida's endangered coral reef by contributing resources and expertise to the Florida Coral Rescue Center (the “FCRC”). The FCRC is an environmental conservation effort located in Orlando, Florida that aims to provide a safe and 11 stable home for coral colonies to receive world-class care from a team of experts, including experts from SeaWorld. The FCRC was established for gene banking and care of corals rescued from reefs not yet affected by disease impacting corals in the wild. We have supported conservation efforts such as the Killer Whale Research and Conservation Program, in partnership with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, to study and protect endangered killer whales in the wild, with a particular focus on the Southern Resident killer whale population found off the coast of Washington. Another example is a partnership with marine wildlife artist and conservationist Guy Harvey focused on ocean health and the plight of sharks in the wild. We also continue to support the Hubbs-SeaWorld Research Institute, which was started over 55 years ago by one of SeaWorld’s founders and remains a world-renowned scientific research organization committed to conserving and renewing marine life to ensure a healthier planet. Alongside our conservation work, we are committed to giving back to the communities in which our theme parks are located. We focus our philanthropic efforts in three areas: animal preservation and stewardship; youth development and education; and community initiatives that address environmental sustainability. We partner with charities across the country whose values and missions are aligned with our own by providing financial support, in-kind resources, strategic guidance and/or hands-on volunteer work. Additionally, our ambassadors are actively involved in volunteer activities, such as beach and river cleanup efforts, fun run charity fundraisers, local food bank distributions and more. We also provide complimentary tickets and discounts to educators as well as active and former military and their families. Sustainable Operations Environmental conservation is implicit in our purpose. To thrive, animals need vibrant ecosystems and healthy habitats. We understand the adverse effects of human behavior and climate change on ecosystems and the animals who call them home; therefore, we are constantly working to minimize the footprint of our operations. As a part of our commitment to conservation, we have invested in numerous projects to reduce our energy and water use and the amount of waste we generate. For example, in 2019, the first full year of the elevated solar panel project at Aquatica San Diego, the panels generated nearly 100% of the park’s annual energy use. We believe our parks have some of the most advanced and efficient water purification systems in the world, which provide the optimum environment for our marine life. We leverage this knowledge to reclaim and recycle wastewater for reuse, thereby decreasing our consumption of fresh water. We have also implemented a range of other water conservation efforts across our parks, including a natural biofiltration system in 2019 at SeaWorld San Antonio, which is the first of its kind in a zoological setting. Many of our water conservation efforts incorporate lessons from our facilities in San Diego and San Antonio, which, driven in part by drought conditions, have found innovative opportunities to harvest rainwater, reuse water for cooling buildings, and adapt landscaping to require less water. We continually look for new ways to reduce water use in our parks and to support water conservation projects elsewhere. We see the impacts of marine debris and litter along shorelines and in coastal waters, estuaries, and oceans – a visible reminder of the need to reduce waste. We have implemented programs to generate less waste in our parks and to increase our recycling efforts. For example, in 2019, we replaced polystyrene foam dinnerware products with products made from 100% recycled materials at all of our parks. We also have removed all single use plastic drinking straws and shopping bags, have an extensive recycling infrastructure in place in all our parks and actively encourage our guests to recycle. Several of our parks have been externally recognized for their recycling programs. For example, SeaWorld San Diego has received the City of San Diego’s Environmental Services Department as a “Recycler of the Year” 20 times over the award’s history. We raise awareness with our employees and guests about the need for all of us to do our part to address this global challenge. Responsible Sourcing Corporate responsibility extends to how we source the goods and services needed to operate our parks and to serve our guests. We have established a Responsible Food Sourcing Policy, which outlines our commitment to partner with food suppliers that deliver products that meet or exceed sustainable, healthy and humane food standards. For example, our parks have converted to 100% cage-free eggs. We have also made a variety of commitments related to the sourcing of particular products. We have also set a goal of purchasing from suppliers that have announced a commitment and published targets to convert to group-housed humane farming. In response to growing guest demand, we have also taken steps to expand the number of plant-based food offerings on our menus across our parks. As part of these efforts, in 2019, we added a sustainable, plant-based burger to our menus at all of our parks. We have also taken additional steps, where possible, to identify and partner with brands and products in our parks which share our commitment to giving back to communities, animals, and/or our broader environment. Human Capital Management We have a diverse and mission-driven team of employee ambassadors. Our team makes it possible each day to provide our guests with experiences that matter and to inspire them to protect animals and the wild wonders of our world. As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 2,800 full-time employees and approximately 11,400 part-time and seasonal employees. During our peak operating season in 2021, we employed additional part-time and seasonal employees, including high school and college students. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. 12 Our focus on recruiting and developing diverse talent has resulted in a management team that is approximately 49 % female and 4 2 % of a minority ethnicity. Similarly, our overall workforce is 5 2 % women and 5 4 % of a minority ethnicity. We don’t simply view diversity as a target, but rather a continual commitment to focus on creating the best and most inclusive workplace possible by recognizing and celebrating our unique backgrounds. We strive to provide our ambassadors with a competitive compensation package using market data including comprehensive benefits. We provide benefits including health, dental, vision, disability, life insurance, retirement, paid time-off, complimentary tickets and various other benefits. In response to the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic and for the safety of our ambassadors, we implemented new procedures which included remote work places when possible, social distancing, COVID-19 specific training and contact tracing to help protect our employees from the spread of the virus. Safety is not just important as it relates to the COVID-19 pandemic. We provide training and require certifications for certain positions. We routinely review all procedures and safety requirements to promote a safe working environment for our ambassadors, guests and animals. We believe that working for our Company is more than a job – it is a commitment to the protection of animals and the wild wonders of our world, while also providing a fun and meaningful experience for our guests that will be remembered long after they leave our parks. We create memories that matter. Our human capital programs, policies, and initiatives will continue to reinforce this belief in the years ahead. Our Products and Services Admission Tickets We generate most of our revenue from selling admission to our theme parks. We engage with travel agents, ticket resellers and travel agencies, and directly with our guests through our websites and social media, to promote advanced ticket sales and provide guest convenience and ease of entry. Guests who visit our theme parks have the option of purchasing multiple types of admission tickets, from single and multi-day tickets to season or annual passes. In addition, visitors can purchase vacation packages with preferred hotels, behind-the-scenes tours and educational animal encounters, specialty dining packages, and front of the line “Quick Queue” access to enhance their experience. We actively use pricing and promotions to manage capacity and maximize revenue. We utilize demand-based pricing for select peak time periods at some of our parks, advance purchase discounts to encourage early commitment, and seasonal pricing models to drive demand in non-peak time periods. In-Park Offerings We generate revenue from the sale of in-park products and services, primarily consisting of food, beverage and merchandise items. Food and Beverage Offerings We strive to deliver a variety of high quality, creative and memorable food and beverage experiences for our guests. Our culinary team focuses on providing creative menu offerings and ways to deliver those offerings that appeal to our diverse guest base. We also offer a variety of dining programs that provide quality food and great value to our guests and drive incremental revenues. While our menu offerings have broad appeal, they also cater to guests who desire healthy options and those with special allergy-related needs. Our all-day-dining program delivers convenience and value to our guests with numerous restaurant choices for one price for the entirety of their day visit to the park. We also offer creative immersive dining experiences that allow guests to dine up-close with our animals and characters. Our commitment to care for the natural world extends to the food that we serve. Some of our menus feature sustainable, organic, seasonal, and locally grown ingredients that aim to minimize environmental impacts to animals and their habitats. In addition, through our ongoing culinary supply chain management initiatives, we believe we are well-positioned to take advantage of changing economic and market conditions. Merchandise and Other In-Park Service Offerings We offer guests the opportunity to capture memories through our products and services, including through traditional retail shops, game venues and customized photos. We make a focused effort to leverage the emotional connection of the theme park experiences, capitalize on trends, and optimize brand alignment with our merchandise product offerings. In-park games are designed with the goal of creating positive family experiences for guests of every age. Our merchandise teams also focus on making a visit to our theme parks easy, convenient, and comfortable. This includes offering quick queue passes for front of the line access to popular attraction, reserved seating, cabana rentals and other guest conveniences like lockers or service vehicle rentals such as strollers, electric personal carts and wheelchairs. 13 Consumer Products and Licensing To capitalize on our popular brands, we leverage content through licensing and consumer product arrangements. We developed licensed consumer products to drive consumer sales through retail channels beyond our theme parks and continue to look for this channel to grow. While currently these licensed consumer products do not represent a significant percentage of our total revenue, we believe by leveraging our brands and our intellectual property through consumer products, we will create new revenue streams and enhance the value of our brands through greater brand visibility, consumer awareness and increased consumer loyalty. In addition, we have expanded our brand appeal through strategic alliances with well-known external brands, including Sesame Street and Build-A-Bear. We have also incorporated Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer™ and other well-known characters into five of our park holiday programs under a license agreement with Character Arts, LLC, which currently runs through January 2024. Group Events At times we host a variety of different group events and meetings at our theme parks, both during the day and at night. Our parks provide a wide variety of unique venues, backdrops and products for groups and include venues such as the icy walls of Antarctica, concert ready stadiums, outdoor pavilions, animal habitats and fully air-conditioned ballrooms. Our special group ticket packages and offerings appeal to specialty markets such as youth, sports, social (e.g. family reunions) and fraternal groups, as well as corporate groups seeking to recognize and reward their employees. Park buy-outs have historically allowed groups to enjoy exclusive itineraries, including meetings, educational presentations and shows, up-close encounters with animals and behind-the-scenes tours. Our group facilities are available year-round and fully customizable as they can be built around any of the park’s special events, educational presentations, inspirational shows, or one-of-a-kind attractions. Each of our theme parks offers attractive venues, such as SeaWorld Orlando’s Ports of Call, a 70,000 square foot dedicated special events complex and banquet facility that includes a ballroom, a collection of four outdoor pavilions and a courtyard in Orlando, or a fully enclosed and air-conditioned pavilion in Tampa. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related impacts on the travel industry, group events in 2021 and 2020 were impacted. See the “— Impact of Global COVID-19 Pandemic ” and “Risk Factors ” sections included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial performance. Corporate Sponsorships and Strategic Alliances We seek to secure long-term corporate sponsorships and strategic alliances with leading companies and brands that share our core values, deliver significant brand value, and influence and drive mutual business gains. We identify prospective corporate sponsors based on their industry and industry-leading position, and we select them based on their ability to deliver impactful value to our theme parks and our brands, as well as to consumer products and various entertainment platforms. Our corporate sponsors contribute to us in a multitude of ways, such as through direct marketing, advertising, media exposure and licensing opportunities. Some of our corporate sponsors, such as our partners at Coca-Cola, also join us in making an impact on conservation efforts through contributions to the non-profit SeaWorld & Busch Gardens Conservation Fund. Also see additional discussion concerning our conservation partnerships, such as Guy Harvey, in the “ —Conservation and Community Relations” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Seasonality See the seasonality discussion in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our Markets, Guests and Customers Our theme parks are entertainment venues with broad demographic appeal and are located near a number of large metropolitan areas, including 6 of the 10 most populous metropolitan areas in the United States and 7 of the top 25 Best Destinations in the United States (U.S. Census, 2021; TripAdvisor, 2021) . Additionally, because our theme parks are divided between regional and destination theme parks, historically our guests have included local visitors, non-local domestic visitors and international visitors. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related impacts, travel from domestic and international markets were impacted in 2020 and 2021. See the “— Impact of Global COVID-19 Pandemic ” and “Risk Factors ” sections included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. Intellectual Property Our business is affected by our ability to protect against infringement of our intellectual property, including our trademarks, service marks, domain names, copyrights, and other proprietary rights. Important intellectual property includes rights in names, logos, character likenesses, theme park attractions and systems related to the study and care of certain of our animals. In addition, we are party to key license agreements as licensee, including our agreements with Anheuser-Busch, Incorporated (“ABI”) and Sesame Workshop (“Sesame”) as discussed below. 14 Busch Gardens License Agreement Our subsidiary, SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment LLC, is a party to a trademark license agreement with ABI, which governs our use of the Busch Gardens name and logo. Under the license agreement, ABI granted to us a perpetual, exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use the Busch Gardens trademark and certain related domain names in connection with the operation, marketing, promotion and advertising of our theme parks, as well as in connection with the production, use, distribution and sale of merchandise sold in connection with such theme parks. The license extends to our Busch Gardens theme parks located in Williamsburg, Virginia and Tampa, Florida, and may also include any amusement or theme park anywhere in the world that we acquire, build or rebrand with the Busch Gardens name in the future, subject to certain conditions. ABI may not assign, transfer or sell the Busch Gardens mark without first granting us a reasonable right of first refusal to purchase such mark. We have agreed to indemnify ABI from and against third party claims and losses arising out of or in connection with the operation of the theme parks and the related marketing or promotion thereof, any merchandise branded with the licensed marks and the infringement of a third party’s intellectual property. We are required to carry certain insurance coverage throughout the term of the license. The license agreement can be terminated by ABI under certain limited circumstances, including in connection with certain types of change of control of SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment LLC. Sesame License Agreement Our wholly-owned subsidiary, SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc. (“SEA”), is a party to a license agreement with Sesame, a New York not-for-profit corporation. The License Agreement extends SEA’s status as Sesame’s exclusive theme park partner in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands (the “Sesame Territory”), with a second Sesame Place ® theme park scheduled to open in 2022. We plan to open our second Sesame Place theme park at the site of the current Aquatica San Diego in March 2022. After the opening of Sesame Place San Diego, we will have the option to build additional Sesame Place theme parks in the Sesame Territory. Under the terms of the license agreement, including the requirement for certain subsequent approvals from Sesame, Sesame granted SEA the right to use the Sesame Street Elements (as defined below) (a) in connection with the design, building, installation, theming, promotion, and operation of SEA’s existing Sesame Place theme park, located in Langhorne, Pennsylvania (the “Langhorne Sesame Place”) and additional Sesame Place theme parks in the United States, including Sesame Place San Diego (collectively, the “Standalone Parks”); (b) in connection with the design, building, installation, theming, promotion, and operation of SEA’s existing Sesame Lands (currently known as Sesame Street ® Land at SeaWorld Orlando, which opened in spring of 2019, Sesame Street Bay of Play at SeaWorld San Antonio, Sesame Street Bay of Play at SeaWorld San Diego, Sesame Street Safari of Fun at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay, and Sesame Street Forest of Fun at Busch Gardens Williamsburg) and additional Sesame Lands, (collectively, the “Sesame Lands”); (c) in connection with the Licensed Products (as defined below); (d) in marketing and promotional activities related to the Standalone Parks and Sesame Lands, including without limitation, marketing, advertising and promotion, character appearances and live presentations (both in park and in off-site promotional activities such as schools, parades, conventions, etc.), and the Licensed Products; and/or (e) to seek and to enter into sponsorship agreements for specific sponsorships of Sesame Street -themed attractions. In addition, SEA has been granted a license to (i) develop and manufacture or have developed and manufactured products that utilize the Sesame Street Elements or to purchase products that utilize the Sesame Street Elements from Sesame’s third party licensees (collectively, the “Licensed Products”), (ii) to market, promote, advertise, distribute and sell the Licensed Products within each of SEA’s theme parks and through online stores on SEA’s websites and targeted primarily to consumers in the United States and (iii) to contract with third party vendors to promote, distribute and sell the Licensed Products within the United States. The term “Sesame Street Elements” means all current and hereafter developed or owned titles, marks, names, characters (including any new Sesame Street characters shown on Sesame Street and owned in whole or controlled by Sesame), images, likenesses, audio, video, audiovisual, logos, themes, symbols, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, visual representations and designs, and other intellectual property (whether in two- or three-dimensional form and including animated and mechanical representations) owned or controlled by Sesame (or its affiliates), and associated with the “ Sesame Street ” television property, whether previously (unless retired) or currently on “ Sesame Street ” or whether hereafter developed or owned and the names and marks “ Sesame Place ” and “ Sesame Land, ” but expressly excluding “Kermit the Frog.” Sesame has reserved rights to build family entertainment centers using the Sesame Street Elements subject to certain territorial restrictions surrounding SEA’s Sesame Place Standalone Parks and Sesame Lands within the Sesame Territory. The license agreement has an initial term through December 31, 2031, with an automatic additional 15 year extension plus a 5 year option added from each new Standalone Park opening. Pursuant to the license agreement, SEA pays specified annual license fees, as well as a schedule of royalties based on revenues earned in connection with admissions, sales of Licensed Products, all food and beverage items utilizing the licensed elements and any events utilizing such elements if a separate fee is paid for such event. 15 International Development Strategy We believe that in addition to the growth potential that exists domestically, our brands can also have significant appeal in certain international markets. We continue to make progress in our partnership with Miral Asset Management LLC to develop SeaWorld Abu Dhabi, a first-of-its-kind marine life themed park on Yas Island (the “Middle East Project”). As part of this partnership, we are providing certain services pertaining to the planning and design of the Middle East Project, with funding received from our partner in the Middle East expected to offset our internal expenses. Construction for the Middle East Project is on track and scheduled to be completed by the end of 2022. For a discussion of certain risks associated with our international development strategy, including the Middle East Project, see the “ Risk Factors ” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “ Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry—We may not realize the benefits of developments, restructurings, acquisitions or other strategic initiatives .” Our Industry In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted the theme park industry causing complete shutdowns or extended periods of closure. Some theme parks chose to partially reopen with capacity limitations and enhanced safety protocols, which allowed them to resume operations but with lower levels of attendance. With the widespread introduction and reception of vaccines to fight COVID-19 in 2021, the operating environment and attendance levels have generally improved; however, COVID-19 related factors continue to impact domestic and international travel, group-related attendance and events, public opinion concerning social gatherings and consumer behavior. We believe the industry will eventually return to its pre-COVID-19 levels and mix of attendance. We believe that the theme park industry is an attractive sector characterized by a proven business model that over the long-term generates significant cash flow and has avenues for growth. Theme parks offer a strong consumer value proposition, particularly when compared to other forms of out-of-home entertainment such as concerts, sporting events, cruises and movies. As a result, theme parks attract a broad range of guests and generally exhibit strong operating margin across regions, operators, park types and macroeconomic conditions. Competition Our theme parks and other product and entertainment offerings compete directly for discretionary spending with other destination and regional theme parks and water and amusement parks and indirectly with other types of recreational facilities and forms of entertainment, including movies, home entertainment options, sports attractions, restaurants and vacation travel. Principal direct competitors of our theme parks include theme parks operated by The Walt Disney Company, Universal Parks and Resorts, Six Flags Entertainment Corporation, Cedar Fair, L.P., Merlin Entertainments ltd., and Hershey Entertainment and Resorts Company. Our highly differentiated products provide a value proposition and a complementary experience to those offered by fantasy-themed Disney and Universal parks. In addition, we benefit from the significant capital investments made in developing the tourism industry in the Orlando area. The Orlando theme park market is extremely competitive, with a high concentration of theme parks operated by several companies. Competition is based on multiple factors including location, price, the originality and perceived quality of the rides and attractions, the atmosphere and cleanliness of the theme park, the quality of food and entertainment, weather conditions, ease of travel to the theme park (including direct flights by major airlines), availability and cost of transportation to a theme park, industry best practices and perceptions as to safety. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe the level of attendance at theme parks has been and will continue to be impacted by public concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of reported local cases of COVID-19, travel restrictions, federal, state and local regulations related to public places, limits on social gatherings and overall public safety sentiment. We believe we can compete effectively, due to our strong brand recognition, unique and extensive zoological collection, diversity of product offerings and locations, targeted capital investments, guest sentiment related to our rescue and conservation efforts, and valuable real estate. Additionally, we believe that our theme parks feature a sufficient quality and variety of rides and attractions, educational and interactive experiences, merchandise locations, restaurants and family orientation to make them highly competitive with other destination and regional theme parks, as well as other forms of entertainment. Regulatory Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances including, but not limited to, those regulating the environment, display, possession and care of our animals, amusement park rides, building and construction, health and safety, labor and employment, workplace safety, zoning and land use and alcoholic beverage and food service. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have also had to comply with rapidly changing local, state and federal rules, orders and regulations. Key statutes and treaties relating to the display, possession and care of our zoological collection include the Endangered Species Act, Marine Mammal Protection Act, Animal Welfare Act, Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species and Fauna Protection Act and the Lacey Act. We must also comply with the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, Wild Bird Conservation Act and National Environmental Policy Act, among other laws and regulations. We believe that we are in compliance with applicable laws, regulations and ordinances; however, such requirements may change over time, and there can be no assurance 16 that new requirements, changes in enforcement policies or newly discovered conditions relating to our properties or operations will not require significant expenditures in the future. Recent Regulatory Developments The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”) released a proposed rule on February 3, 2016 to amend the Animal Welfare Act regulations concerning the humane handling, care and treatment of marine mammals in captivity (the “Proposed APHIS Regulations”). The Proposed APHIS Regulations were subject to public comment which ended on May 4, 2016. We submitted a comment letter to APHIS expressing our views on the Proposed APHIS Regulations. The full impact of the Proposed APHIS Regulations on our business will not be known until the Proposed APHIS Regulations are finalized. These Proposed APHIS Regulations were not listed as a priority for APHIS with the release in July 2021 of the Department of Agriculture’s latest Semiannual Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions for Fall 2021 (the “Fall 2021 Unified Agenda”) indicating that the agency did not plan any further action at that time on the matter. However, there can be no assurance that APHIS will not propose or enact regulations that could materially impact the Company in the future. APHIS did include in the Fall 2021 Unified Agenda a notice that it planned to issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to extend its enforcement of the Animal Welfare Act (the “AWA”) to birds, other than birds bred for use in research. APHIS says this would help ensure the humane care and treatment of such birds. The full impact of these regulations will not be known until the Proposed APHIS Regulations are published. On December 3, 2021, APHIS released a Final Rule related to contingency plans for the handling of animals. This rulemaking, which became effective on January 3, 2022, amends AWA regulations to add requirements for contingency planning and training of personnel by research facilities and by dealers, exhibitors, intermediate handlers, and carriers. APHIS says this action will heighten the awareness of licensees and registrants regarding their responsibilities and help ensure a timely and appropriate response should an emergency or disaster occur. For a discussion of certain risks associated with federal and state regulations governing the treatment of animals, see the “ Risk Factors ” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “ Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry—We are subject to complex federal and state regulations governing the treatment of animals, which can change, and to claims and lawsuits by activist groups before government regulators and in the courts. ” We face a rapidly changing regulatory environment across our business, including responses to COVID-19, wages and hour regulations, employee health and benefit requirement and the policy agenda of the U.S. President and his administration to name a few. For more detailed discussion, see the “Impact of Global COVID-19 Pandemic” section and the following under the “Risk Factors” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, “ The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our business and could adversely affect our results of operations and/or various other factors beyond our control could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations; Increased labor costs and employee health and welfare benefits may negatively impact our operations; and The policies of the U.S. President and his administration or any changes to tax laws may result in a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial condition and may impact our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards.” Insurance We maintain insurance of the type and in the amounts that we believe to be commercially reasonable for businesses in our industry. We maintain primary and excess casualty coverage of up to $100.0 million. As part of this coverage, we retain deductible/self-insured retention exposures consistent with our normal expected losses related to general liability claims, automobile liability and workers’ compensation claims. We maintain employers’ liability and all coverage required by law in the states in which we operate. Defense costs are included in the insurance coverage we obtain against losses in these areas. Based upon our historical experience of reported claims and an estimate for incurred-but-not-reported claims, we accrue a liability for our deductible/self-insured retention contingencies regarding general liability, automobile liability and workers’ compensation exposures. We maintain additional forms of special casualty coverage which we believe is appropriate for our business. We also maintain commercial property coverage against fire, natural perils, so-called “extended coverage” perils such as civil commotion, business interruption and terrorism exposures for protection of our real and personal properties (other than land). We generally renegotiate our insurance policies on an annual basis. We cannot predict the amounts of premium cost that we may be required to pay for future insurance coverage, the level of any deductibles/self-insured retentions or co-insurance we may retain applicable thereto, the level of aggregate excess coverage available, the availability of coverage for special or specific risks or whether the amount of insurance will be sufficient to cover all actual perils that may occur. For example, our losses in 2020 related to the impacts of the COVID -19 pandemic were not covered by insurance available to us. 17 Corporate History Our legacy started in 1959 with the opening of our first Busch Gardens theme park in Tampa, Florida. Since then, we have grown our portfolio of strong brands and strategically expanded across five states. On December 1, 2009, investment funds affiliated with The Blackstone Group L.P. and certain co-investors, through SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc. (“SEA”), acquired 100% of the equity interests of Sea World LLC (f/k/a Sea World, Inc.) and SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment LLC (f/k/a Busch Entertainment Corporation) from certain subsidiaries of Anheuser-Busch Companies, Inc. We refer to this acquisition and related financing transactions as the “2009 Transactions.” SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware on October 2, 2009 in connection with the 2009 Transactions and changed its name from SW Holdco, Inc. to SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. in December 2012. We completed our initial public offering (the “IPO”) in April 2013 and our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “SEAS”. On May 8, 2017, an affiliate of ZHG Group, Sun Wise (UK) Co., LTD. (“ZHG”) acquired approximately 21% of the then outstanding shares of our common stock from certain affiliates of Blackstone (the “Seller”), pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement between ZHG and the Seller (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”). ZHG pledged such shares in connection with certain loan obligations of ZHG (the “Pledged Shares”). ZHG subsequently defaulted on such loan obligations and, as a result, certain lenders (the “Lenders”) foreclosed on the Pledged Shares and, accordingly, the Pledged Shares were transferred to a security agent for the Lenders (the “Security Agent”), on May 3, 2019. On May 27, 2019, the Security Agent entered into a share repurchase agreement with us pursuant to which the Security Agent agreed to sell and we agreed to purchase 5,615,874 of the Pledged Shares held by the Security Agent (the “SEAS Repurchase”). On May 27, 2019, the Security Agent also entered into a stock purchase agreement with Hill Path Capital LP (“Hill Path”) and certain of its affiliates pursuant to which the Security Agent agreed to sell and certain affiliates of Hill Path agreed to purchase, in the aggregate, 13,214,000 of the Pledged Shares held by the Security Agent. The purchase closed on May 30, 2019. As of December 31, 2021, Hill Path owned approximately 36.0% of our total outstanding common stock.

indebtedness. • If COVID-19 vaccination of employees is mandated, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock • Our stock price may change significantly, and you may not be able to sell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid or at all, and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result. • We cannot guarantee that our allocation of capital to various alternatives will enhance long-term stockholder value, and in some cases, our Share Repurchase Program could increase the volatility of the price of our common stock. • Future sales, or the perception of future sales, by us or our existing stockholders in the public market could cause the market price for our common stock to decline. • Our indebtedness could limit our ability to make restricted payments such as share repurchases and/or pay dividends on our common stock in the future. • Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control. • The concentration of ownership of our capital stock limits your ability to influence corporate matters. • Non-U.S. holders who own or owned more than a certain ownership threshold may be subject to United States federal income tax on gains realized on the disposition of our common stock. 20 The following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating us and this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain statements in “Risk Factors” are forward-looking statements. See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” elsewhere in this report: Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our business and could adversely affect our results of operations, and/or various other factors beyond our control could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic have disrupted our business, including quarantines, significant travel warnings and restrictions, social distancing rules, curfews, shelter-in-place, facial covering mandates, vaccination requirements and/or COVID-19 testing guidelines which were or have been implemented and may be re-implemented pursuant to federal, state and local orders and mandates. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, from March 16, 2020 to June 5, 2020, we temporarily closed all of our theme parks and therefore, did not generate revenue from our parks during the closure period. Beginning on June 6, 2020, we began the phased reopening of some of our parks with enhanced health, safety and cleaning measures, capacity limitations and/or modified/limited operations, which at times included reduced hours and/or reduced operating days. Our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic due in part to capacity limitations, modified/limited operations and/or temporary park closures which were in place for portions of the respective periods, as well as decreased demand due to public concerns associated with the pandemic, reduced group-related attendance and restrictions on international travel. It is impossible to predict the severity and transmission rate of COVID-19, the impact of any mutations of the virus, the extent and effectiveness of any vaccine or containment actions taken, and the impact of these and other factors on travel and consumer behavior. It is possible that the spread of COVID-19, the resulting economic and societal impact, social distancing or other safety requirements which may exist today or that may be implemented will reduce our guests’ interest or ability to visit our theme parks. The COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken in response pose the risk that we or our employees, contractors, suppliers, and other business partners may be prevented from conducting business activities for an unknown period of time. Restrictions on travel, quarantines and other measures imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as ongoing concern regarding the virus’ potential impact and mutations and spikes in the number of infections, have had and will likely continue to have a negative effect on economies and financial markets, including supply chain shortages; staffing challenges, for us, our suppliers and those that support the travel industry; and additional business disruptions. Any such impacts could have a material adverse effect on our business. In response to our temporary park closures in 2020, we took steps to minimize our cash outflows, manage costs and expenditures and maximize liquidity. Some of these measures taken in 2020 included, but were not limited to (i) substantially reduced or deferred all capital projects while our parks were closed other than a minimal amount of essential projects and maintenance and postponed the opening of rides that were still under construction and scheduled to open in 2020; (ii) eliminated and/or deferred all non-essential operating expenses at all of our parks and corporate headquarters while the parks were closed and actively managed operating expenses as parks reopened; (iii) eliminated substantially all advertising and marketing spend while the parks were closed and strategically managed marketing spend as parks reopened; (iv) temporarily reduced Executive Officer base pay by 20% through November 2020; (v) worked with certain vendors and other business partners to manage, defer, and/or abate certain costs and payments; and (vi) furloughed approximately 95% of our employees upon closing all of our parks. It is unclear if any of these actions could have a lasting negative impact on our relationships with vendors, current and/or future business partners or ambassadors or, if parks are forced to close again, whether we will be forced to take similar actions and be able to achieve similar cost savings. We have been sued and may face additional lawsuits or damage to our reputation related to actions taken or not taken as a result of COVID-19 from current and/or future vendors, customers and/or ambassadors. The lawsuits could negatively impact our cash flows and results of operations; however, none have been material to date. Also, another prolonged closure of our parks could materially impact our results, operations and financial condition. Additionally, due to the uncertainties created by the COVID-19 pandemic and the related impact on our business, we have made or may make future employment or restructuring decisions which may subject us to increased risks related to employment matters, including increased union organizing activity, litigation and/or claims for severance or other benefits. We had never previously experienced a complete cessation of our operations. In addition, the magnitude, duration and speed of the global pandemic is uncertain. As a consequence, we cannot estimate the impact on our business, financial condition or near or longer-term financial or operational results with certainty. We may face additional costs and obstacles in complying with any new federal, state or local regulations or industry best practices established in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, hiring and retaining employees and attracting guests who may not wish to travel or visit our theme parks for a prolonged period. In addition, any measures we take or may be required to take such as limiting capacity in our theme parks, enforcing social distancing requirements and/or requiring facial coverings or vaccinations may negatively impact attendance at our theme parks. It is not possible to predict what steps, if any, we may be required to take if the COVID-19 pandemic worsens or any similar pandemic occurs in the future. 21 It is possible we could be forced to close some or all of our parks again. If we do not continue to respond appropriately to the pandemic, or if customers do not perceive our response to be adequate, we could suffer damage to our reputation, which could significantly adversely affect our business. Furthermore, the effects of the pandemic on our business could be long-lasting and could continue to have adverse effects, some of which may be significant, and which may indefinitely impact our ability to operate our business in the traditional, pre-pandemic manner. Our business also could be significantly affected should the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic lead to systemic changes in consumer behavior. The outbreak of COVID-19 has significantly increased economic uncertainty. It is possible that the current outbreak, continued spread of COVID-19 or another pandemic could cause a global recession, which could further adversely affect our business, and such adverse effects may be material. Further, our results of operations and financial condition would be negatively impacted if we experience another prolonged period of closure, experience significant declines in business volumes, are unable to maintain normalized performance levels or attendance at our parks is limited due to capacity restrictions or consumer sentiment. Our properties are subject to the risk that operations could be halted for a temporary or extended period of time. If there is a prolonged disruption at any of our properties, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects will likely be materially adversely affected. Additionally, if a prolonged downturn of general economic or other conditions in the areas in which our properties are located or from which we draw our guests or prevents guests from easily coming to our properties, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects will be materially adversely affected. Also, we cannot be certain that we will have access to sufficient liquidity in the future to meet our obligations for the time required to allow our cash generating operations to normalize should we be forced to close again. In the future, we may not be able to obtain additional liquidity or additional relief from lenders, governmental agencies, and business partners may not be adequate and may include onerous terms. If we fail to hire and/or retain employees, our business may be adversely affected. Our success depends in part upon a number of employees, including members of our senior management team who have extensive experience in the industry, as well as o ur ability to attract, train, motivate and retain qualified employees to keep pace with our needs, including employees with certain specialized skills in the field of animal training and care. We also employ a significant seasonal and part-time workforce which is critical to staffing our parks during peak periods. We recruit year-round to fill thousands of part time and seasonal staffing positions each season and work to manage wages and the timing of the hiring process in an attempt to ensure the appropriate workforce is in place; however, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in the future. During 2021, in part due to the overall labor market, challenging current operating environment, and COVID-19 related factors, we encountered increased turnover and wage pressures and we continue to experience turnover and wage pressures in the current operating environment . Competition for employees is intense and the labor market is experiencing significant shortages, which has impacted, and has continued to impact, our ability to attract, recruit and retain both qualified senior executives as well as employees for our parks and our headquarters. Many competitors or other businesses in the markets in which we operate have increased wages and/or offered enhanced benefit packages which in some cases may be superior to ours. We may be unable to retain employees or to attract other highly qualified employees, particularly if we do not offer employment terms that are competitive with the rest of the current market and/or provide sufficient incentives to retain our existing and future employees. Also, if we fail to maintain a culture that makes our company an attractive place to work, employee morale may be diminished and we may have difficulty retaining our workforce and recruiting new employees. Separately, minimum wage legislation impacts some of our markets which adds additional pressure to our starting wages. Partly as a result of these dynamics, during 2021 and currently, we have had difficulty retaining, attracting and hiring ambassadors to meet the staffing goals of certain functions in our parks and corporate headquarters. These staffing challenges impacted our ability to open some of our food and beverage outlets, caused us to temporarily close some rides or attractions and/or caused longer wait times in certain areas of our parks, particularly food, beverage and/or retail outlets. Despite the staffing challenges we have encountered, we will not compromise the safety of our guests, ambassadors or animals. If we are unable to attract and retain adequate numbers of employees to staff our parks especially during peak periods, this could materially adversely affect our business and negatively impact our results of operations and the guest experience as it could impact the number of venues, rides and/or attractions we can open. See also, “ Increased labor costs and employee health and welfare benefits may negatively impact our operations”. Turnover of personnel, timing or the extent of turnover activity, failure to attract, motivate and retain our employees, or failure to develop and implement a viable succession plan for our senior management, could adversely affect our business, our ability to grow and maintain our business and our future success. Changes in our management team and to the Board of Directors may be disruptive to, or cause uncertainty in, our business, and any additional changes to the management team or the Board of Directors could have a negative impact on our ability to manage and grow our business effectively. Any disruption or uncertainty or difficulty in efficiently and effectively filling key management roles or maintaining and growing our workforce could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and/or the price of our common stock . 22 Various factors beyond our control could adversely affect attendance and guest spending patterns at our theme parks. Various factors beyond our control could adversely affect attendance and guest spending patterns at our theme parks. These factors could also affect our suppliers, vendors, insurance carriers and other contractual counterparties. Such factors include but are not limited to: • bad weather and even forecasts of bad weather, including abnormally hot, cold, snow/ice and/or wet weather, particularly during weekends, holidays or other peak periods; • natural disasters, such as hurricanes, fires, earthquakes, tsunamis, tornados, floods and volcanic eruptions and man-made disasters such as oil spills, which may deter travelers from scheduling vacations or cause them to cancel travel or vacation plans; • labor shortages impacting our parks, suppliers or others in the travel industry such as airlines and hotels; • inflation; • supply chain delays or shortages; • fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; • low consumer confidence; • outbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases or consumers’ concerns relating to potential exposure to travel-related health concerns such as pandemics and epidemics such as Coronavirus, Ebola, Zika, Influenza H1N1, avian bird flu, SARS and MERS; • changes in the desirability of particular locations or travel patterns of both our domestic and international guests; • oil prices and travel costs and the financial condition of the airline, automotive and other transportation-related industries, any travel-related disruptions or incidents and their impact on travel or decrease transportation options to cities where we have parks; • war, terrorist activities or threats and heightened travel security measures instituted in response to these events; • actions or statements by U.S. and foreign governmental officials related to travel and corporate travel-related activities (including changes to the U.S. visa rules or disease related restrictions or testing requirements) and the resulting public perception of such travel and activities; and • interruption of public or private utility services to our theme parks. Any one or more of these factors could adversely affect attendance, revenue, and per capita spending at our theme parks, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and inflation impact our business. A strong dollar increases the cost for international tourists and inflationary pressures increase the cost of living which could impact guest’s willingness to visit our parks or guest spending. In addition, demand for our parks is highly dependent on the general environment for travel and tourism, which can be significantly adversely affected by extreme weather events, including ice and snow conditions. In 2021, the United States encountered increased inflation and we experienced increased costs for labor, goods, services and capital projects. Inflation increases the cost of goods we purchase, capital projects, wages and benefits, and services we buy. If we are not able to offset inflationary costs, our results of operations will be negatively impacted and possible in a material manner. Any of these such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Additionally, because many of the attractions at our parks are outdoors, attendance at our parks is adversely affected by bad or extreme weather conditions and forecasts of bad or mixed weather conditions, which negatively affects our revenues and results of operations. Adverse weather events could also cause us to incur significant costs to repair or replace rides or facilities and cause extended closure times if rides or facilities have to be replaced. Natural disasters and adverse weather conditions can be caused or exacerbated by climate change, and the series of extreme weather events experienced in recent years presents an alarming trend. For example, attendance at our parks in 2019 was negatively impacted by Hurricane Dorian over Labor Day weekend. Separately, we have previously also experienced negative impacts from weather events in other parks, particularly hurricanes, which have caused park closures in Tampa and Orlando and park closures and other weather impacts in Texas and Virginia. We are subject to complex federal and state regulations governing the treatment of animals, which can change, and to claims and lawsuits by activist groups before government regulators and in the courts. We operate in a complex and evolving regulatory environment and are subject to various federal and state statutes and regulations and international treaties implemented by federal law. The states in which we operate also regulate zoological activity involving the import and export of exotic and native wildlife, endangered and/or otherwise protected species, zoological display and anti-cruelty statutes. We incur significant compliance costs in connection with these regulations and violation of such regulations could subject us to fines and penalties and result in the loss of our licenses and permits, which, if occurred, could impact our ability to display certain animals. Future amendments to existing statutes, regulations and treaties or new statutes, regulations and treaties or 23 lawsuits against the Company, government agencies or other third parties in the zoological industry may potentially restrict our ability to maintain our animals, or to acquire new ones to supplement or sustain our breeding programs or otherwise adversely affect our business. In 2016, the California Orca Protection Act was enacted into law and (i) codified the end of captive breeding programs and the export and import of genetic materials for orcas in California, (ii) prohibits the import or export of new orcas into or existing orcas out of California, (iii) permits the transfer of orcas currently in California among existing SeaWorld facilities and (iv) requires educational presentations of orcas in California. We introduced new orca programs in our San Diego park in 2017 which are consistent with these standards. In the past, Congress has proposed legislation that would have impacted the breeding, the taking (wild capture), and the import or export of orcas for the purposes of public display and the transport of orcas from one park to another. However, no legislation has been introduced in the current 117 th Congress. There can be no assurance that Congress will not pass legislation or other federal, state or local jurisdictions will not propose or enact additional laws or regulations that could materially impact the Company in the future. Also, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”) has proposed regulations that could impact our business. For example, APHIS released a proposed rule on February 3, 2016 to amend the Animal Welfare Act regulations concerning the humane handling, care and treatment of marine mammals in captivity (the “Proposed APHIS Regulations”). The Proposed APHIS Regulations were subject to public comment which ended on May 4, 2016. We submitted a comment letter to APHIS expressing our views on the Proposed APHIS Regulations. The full impact of the Proposed APHIS Regulations on our business will not be known until the Proposed APHIS Regulations are finalized. These Proposed APHIS Regulations were not listed as a priority for APHIS with the release in July 2021 of the Department of Agriculture’s latest Semiannual Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions for Fall 2021 (the “Fall 2021 Unified Agenda”), indicating that the agency did not plan any further action at that time on the matter. However, there can be no assurance that APHIS will not propose or enact regulations that could materially impact the Company in the future. APHIS did include in the Fall 2021 Unified Agenda a notice that it planned to issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to extend its enforcement of the Animal Welfare Act (AWA) to birds, other than birds bred for use in research. APHIS says this would help ensure the humane care and treatment of such birds. The full impact of these regulations will not be known until the Proposed APHIS Regulations are published. In light of the uncertain legal, legislative and regulatory environment and evolving public sentiment, we continue to evaluate a broad spectrum of enhancements, modifications and alternatives with respect to the display, husbandry and breeding practices, handling and care, and study and research of our orcas and other marine animals. Any decisions regarding such matters are subject to consideration and assessment of various factors including, but not limited to, the health and welfare of the animals, guest sentiment, market conditions, anticipated impact on our business, regulatory environment, legal proceedings, and input from our conservation partners, and other factors. If we were to pursue or be required to pursue any alternative approaches with respect to the display, husbandry and breeding practices, handling and care, or study and research of our orcas or other animals in our zoological collection, the full impact of such alternatives on our business will not be known until such alternatives are finalized. In the meantime, we continue to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate the impact of and ensure compliance with the applicable regulatory and other developments. We are subject to scrutiny by activist and other third-party groups and/or media who can pressure governmental agencies, vendors, partners, and/or regulators, bring action in the courts or create negative publicity about us. From time to time, animal activist and other third-party groups may make claims before government agencies, bring lawsuits against us, and/or attempt to generate negative publicity associated with our business. Such activities sometimes are based on allegations that we do not properly care for some of our animals. On other occasions, such activities are specifically designed to change existing law or enact new law in order to impede our ability to retain, exhibit, acquire or breed animals. While we seek to structure our operations to comply with all applicable federal and state laws and vigorously defend ourselves when sued, there are no assurances as to the outcome of claims and lawsuits that could be brought against us or new laws or changes to existing laws that could negatively impact us. Even if not successful, these lawsuits, or proposed changes to laws, can require deployment of our resources and can lead to negative publicity. Negative publicity created by activists or in the media could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. At times, activists and other third-party groups have also attempted to generate negative publicity related to our relationships with our business partners, such as corporate sponsors, promotional partners, vendors, ticket resellers and others. These activities have at times led relationships with some ticket resellers to be terminated. Although sales from any particular ticket reseller may not constitute a significant portion of our ticket sales, if a relationship with a ticket reseller is terminated, we will attempt to find alternative distribution channels. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful or that those channels will be as successful or not have additional costs. If we are unable to find cost effective alternative distribution channels, the loss of multiple ticket resellers could have a negative impact on our results of operations. 24 Incidents or adverse publicity concerning our theme parks, the theme park industry or zoological facilities generally could harm our brands or reputation as well as negatively impact our revenues and profitability. Our brands and our reputation are among our most important assets. Our ability to attract and retain guests depends, in part, upon the external perceptions of the Company, the quality and safety of our theme parks and services and our corporate and management integrity. The operation of theme parks involves the risk of accidents, illnesses, environmental incidents and other incidents which may negatively affect the perception of guest and employee safety, health, security and guest satisfaction and which could negatively impact our brands or reputation and our business and results of operations. An accident or an injury at any of our theme parks or at theme parks operated by competitors, particularly an accident or an injury involving the safety of guests and employees, that receives media attention, is the topic of a book, film, documentary or is otherwise the subject of public discussions, may harm our brands or reputation, cause a loss of consumer confidence in the Company, reduce attendance at our theme parks and negatively impact our results of operations. Such incidents have occurred in the past and may occur in the future. In addition, other types of adverse publicity concerning our business, the theme park industry or zoological facilities generally could harm our brands, reputation, and results of operations. The considerable expansion in the use of social media over recent years has compounded the impact of negative publicity. There has been and may continue to be perception issues and negative media attention that create a barrier to attendance at our parks which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We could be adversely affected by a decline in discretionary consumer spending or consumer confidence. Our success depends to a significant extent on discretionary consumer spending, which is heavily influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income. In the past, severe economic downturns, coupled with high volatility and uncertainty as to the future global economic landscape, have had an adverse effect on consumers’ discretionary income and consumer confidence. Volatile, negative, inflationary or uncertain economic conditions and recessionary periods may adversely impact attendance figures, the frequency with which guests choose to visit our theme parks and guest spending patterns at our theme parks. The actual or perceived weakness in the economy could also lead to decreased spending by our guests. For example, in 2009 and 2010, we experienced a decline in attendance as a result of the global economic crisis, which in turn adversely affected our revenue and profitability. Both attendance and total revenue per capita spending at our theme parks are key drivers of our revenue and profitability, and reductions in either can materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. A significant portion of our revenues are historically generated in the States of Florida, California and Virginia. Any risks affecting such markets, such as natural disasters, severe weather and travel-related disruptions or incidents, may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Approximately 58%, 15% and 14% of our revenues in 2021 were generated in the States of Florida, California and Virginia, respectively. Any risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, such as the occurrence of natural disasters and travel-related disruptions or incidents, affecting the States of Florida, California and Virginia generally may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, especially if they have the effect of decreasing attendance at our theme parks or, in extreme cases, cause us to close any of our theme parks for any period of time. For example, in 2019, Florida was negatively impacted by Hurricane Dorian. Also, our parks in Texas and Virginia have previously been negatively impacted by hurricanes. Although we attempt to manage our exposure to such events by implementing our hurricane preparedness plan, our theme parks located in Orlando and Tampa, Florida and in Williamsburg, Virginia have previously experienced closures as a result of storms, which negatively impacted attendance and results of operations. Furthermore, changing climate conditions could add to the frequency and severity of natural disasters and create additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures. Our operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations. We have historically experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in our annual theme park attendance and revenue, which are typically higher in our second and third quarters, partly because seven of our theme parks have historically only opened for a portion of the year. Historically, approximately two-thirds of our attendance and revenues were generated in the second and third quarters of the year and we generally incurred a net loss in the first and fourth quarters. In addition, the timing of school vacations and school start dates also cause fluctuations in our quarterly theme park attendance and revenue. For example, revenues can shift between the first and second quarters due to the timing of Easter and spring break holidays and between the first and fourth quarters due to the timing of holiday breaks around Christmas and New Year. Even for our theme parks that have historically been open year-round, attendance patterns have significant seasonality, driven by holidays, school vacations and weather conditions. Changes in school calendars that impact traditional school vacation breaks could also impact attendance patterns. Due in part to the temporary park closures in 2020, along with capacity limitations and/or modified/limited operations and other COVID-19 related impacts on our attendance, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the seasonality of our business. It is difficult to estimate how the COVID-19 pandemic or other similar events in the future will impact seasonality. 25 The operating season at some of our theme parks, including SeaWorld San Antonio, Aquatica San Antonio, Adventure Island, Aquatica San Diego, Busch Gardens Williamsburg, Water Country USA and Sesame Place, has historically been of limited duration. A ny changes to the operating schedule of a park such as increasing operating days for our seasonal parks, could change the impact of seasonality in the future. During 2021, we began year-round operations at SeaWorld San Antonio and began to operate on select days on a year round basis at both Busch Gardens Williamsburg and Sesame Place in Pennsylvania. When conditions or events described in this Risk Factor section occur during the operating season, particularly during the second and third quarters, there is only a limited period of time during which the impact of those conditions or events can be mitigated. Accordingly, such conditions or events may have a disproportionately adverse effect on our revenues and cash flow. In addition, historically most of our expenses for maintenance and costs of adding new attractions at our seasonal theme parks are incurred when the operating season is over, which may increase the need for borrowing to fund such expenses during such periods. Because we operate in a competitive industry, our revenues, profits or market share could be harmed if we are unable to compete effectively. Our theme parks compete with other theme, water and amusement parks and with other types of recreational facilities and forms of entertainment, including movies, home entertainment options, family entertainment centers, sports attractions, restaurants and vacation travel. Principal direct competitors of our theme parks include theme parks operated by The Walt Disney Company, Universal Parks and Resorts, Six Flags Entertainment Corporation, Cedar Fair, L.P., Merlin Entertainments ltd., Herschend Family Entertainment and Hershey Entertainment and Resorts Company. The principal competitive factors of a theme park include location, price, originality and perceived quality of the rides and attractions, the atmosphere and cleanliness of the theme park, the quality of its food and entertainment, weather conditions, ease of travel to the theme park (including direct flights by major airlines), and availability and cost of transportation to a theme park. Certain of our direct competitors have substantially greater financial resources than we do, and they may be able to adapt more quickly to changes in guest preferences or devote greater resources to their attractions or promotion of their offerings and attractions than us. Our competitors may be able to attract guests to their theme parks in lieu of our own through the development or acquisition of new rides, attractions or shows that are perceived by guests to be of a higher quality and entertainment value. As a result, we may not be able to compete successfully against such competitors. If we are unable to compete with new and existing attractions, our results of operations could be negatively impacted. Featuring animals at our theme parks involves risks. Our theme parks feature numerous displays and interactions that include animals. All animal enterprises involve some degree of risk. All animal interactions by our employees and our guests in attractions in our theme parks, where offered, involve risk. While we maintain strict safety procedures for the protection of our guests, employees and the animals in our care, injuries or death, while rare, have occurred in the past. For example, in February 2010, a trainer was killed while engaged in an interaction with an orca. Following this incident, we were subject to an inspection by the Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), which resulted in citations concerning alleged violations of the Occupational Safety and Health Act and certain regulations thereunder. In connection with this incident, we reviewed and revised our safety protocols and made certain safety-related facility enhancements such as revising training protocols used in animal presentations. This incident has also been and continues to be the subject of significant media attention, including extensive television and newspaper coverage, books, at least one documentary and discussions in social media. This incident and similar events that may occur in the future may harm our reputation, reduce attendance and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. See also, “ Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that we could suffer, and our insurance costs may increase."" Animals in our care are important to our theme parks, and they could be exposed to infectious diseases. Many of our theme parks are distinguished from those of our competitors in that we offer guest interactions with animals in our care. Individual animals, specific species of animals or groups of animals in our zoological collection could be exposed to infectious diseases or could expose guests to infectious diseases. An outbreak of an infectious disease among any animals in our theme parks or the public’s perception that a certain disease could be harmful to human health may materially adversely affect our zoological collection, our business, financial condition and results of operations. The high fixed cost structure of theme park operations can result in significantly lower margins if revenues decline or we are unable to offset price increases. A large portion of our expenses is relatively fixed because the costs for employees, maintenance, animal care, utilities, advertising, and insurance do not vary significantly with attendance. These fixed costs may increase at a greater rate than our revenues especially during inflationary periods and may not be able to be reduced at the same rate as declining revenues. If cost-cutting efforts are insufficient to offset increased costs or declines in revenues or are impracticable, we could experience a material decline in margins, revenues, profitability and reduced or negative cash flows. Such effects can be especially pronounced during pandemics such as was seen during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 or periods of inflation or economic contraction or slow economic growth. 26 Changes in consumer tastes and preferences for entertainment and consumer products could reduce demand for our entertainment offerings and products and adversely affect the profitability of our business. The success of our business depends on our ability to consistently provide, maintain, and expand theme park attractions as well as create online material and consumer products that meet changing consumer preferences . In addition, consumers from outside the United States constitute an important portion of our theme park attendance, and our success depends in part on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to tastes and preferences of this consumer group. If our entertainment offerings and products do not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or if consumer preferences change, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Cyber security risks and the failure to maintain the integrity of internal or guest data could result in damages to our reputation, the disruption of operations and/or subject us to costs, fines or lawsuits. We collect internal and customer data for business purposes. This data may include personal identifiable information held in our various information technology systems which collect, process, summarize, and report such data. We also maintain personally identifiable information about our employees. The integrity and protection of our customer, employee and company data is critical to our business. Our guests and employees have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information. The regulatory environment, as well as the requirements imposed on us by the credit card industry, governing information, security and privacy laws is increasingly demanding and continues to evolve. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act took effect in January 2020 and imposes requirements for identifying, managing, securing, tracking, producing and deleting consumer privacy information in California. Maintaining compliance with applicable security and privacy regulations may increase our operating costs and/or adversely impact our ability to market our theme parks, products, and services to our guests. We also rely on accounting, financial and operational management information technology systems to conduct our operations. If these information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. We, along with our third party service providers, face security threats, including but not limited to cyber security attacks on our data infrastructure. Like other public companies, our computer systems are regularly subject to and will continue to be the target of computer viruses, malware or other malicious codes (including ransomware), unauthorized access, cyber-attacks or other computer-related penetrations. We expect to continue devoting significant resources to the security of our information technology systems and the training of our employees and we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate technological threats. There can be no assurance that these procedures, investments and/or controls, nor those of our third party service providers, will be sufficient to prevent penetrations, malicious acts or disruptions to our systems. Furthermore, a penetrated or compromised data system or the intentional, inadvertent or negligent release or disclosure of data could result in theft, loss, fraudulent or unlawful use of guest, employee, company or protected data which could harm our reputation or result in remedial and other costs, fines or lawsuits and require significant management attention and resources to be spent. In addition, our insurance coverage and indemnification arrangements that we enter into, if any, may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to cyber security attacks or disruptions resulting from such events. To date, cyber security attacks directed at us have not had a material impact on our financial results. Due to the evolving nature of security threats, however, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted. Technology interruptions or failures that impair access to our websites or information technology systems could adversely affect our business or operations. The satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our web sites and our infrastructure are critical to the conduct of our business. Any system interruptions that result in the unavailability or slowness of our websites could impact our ability to market or sell admissions or other products which could adversely affect our results of operations and/or result in negative publicity. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, temporary system interruptions for a variety of reasons, including security incidents, viruses, telecommunication and other network failures, power failures, programming errors, undetected bugs, design faults, data corruption, denial-of-service attacks, legacy systems, poor scalability or network overload from an overwhelming number of traffic trying to reach our websites at the same time. Even a disruption as brief as a few minutes could have a negative impact on our online activities and could result in a loss of revenue. For example, there have been instances when our websites experienced slow performance and unavailability for some guests. Although these issues were short-lived and did not have a material impact to our results of operations, prolonged or repeat system interruptions and network failures could adversely impact our operations as a significant portion of our admissions revenues are from ticket purchases and reservations made online. Additionally, damage, failures or interruptions to our information technology systems may require a significant investment to update, remediate or replace with alternate systems, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations as a result. In addition, costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations and/or result in negative publicity. Any material interruptions or failures in our systems, including those that may result from our failure to adequately develop, implement and maintain a robust disaster recovery plan and backup systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance. 27 Increased labor costs and employee health and welfare benefits may negatively impact our operations. Labor is a primary component in the cost of operating our business. We devote significant resources to recruiting and training our employees. Increased labor costs or turnover due to competition, inflationary pressures, increased minimum wage or employee benefit costs or otherwise, would adversely impact our operating expenses. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 and the amendments thereto contain provisions that have impacted our healthcare costs. Additionally, the current administration is encouraging Congress to increase the federal minimum wage more broadly to $15.00 an hour in the private sector. Any future amendments or new legislation could significantly increase our compensation costs, which would reduce our net income and adversely affect our cash flows. In 2016, San Diego passed legislation which, after the first increase on January 1, 2017, increases its minimum wage over a six-year period to $15 an hour by January 1, 2023. After the San Diego minimum wage reaches $15 an hour, it will change based on the consumer price index. Virginia passed legislation that increased the state minimum wage to $9.50 an hour on May 1, 2021 and increases its minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2026. In November 2020, Florida passed a ballot initiative raising minimum wage to $10.00 per hour effective September 30, 2021. Each September 30 th thereafter, minimum wage shall increase by $1.00 per hour until the minimum wage reaches $15.00 per hour on September 30, 2026. From that point forward, future minimum wage increases shall revert to being adjusted annually for inflation starting September 30, 2027. In addition, a number of companies with whom we compete for talent have announced wage increases. Increases to the minimum wage in locations where we do business, wages of companies from whom we compete for talent and/or increased benefit costs will negatively impact our operating expenses. See also “ If we fail to hire and/or retain employees, our business may be adversely affected”. Our growth strategy may not achieve the anticipated results. Our future success will depend on our ability to grow our business, including through capital investments to improve existing and develop or acquire additional theme parks, rides, attractions and shows, as well as in-park product offerings and product offerings outside of our theme parks that are complementary to our parks. Our growth and innovation strategies require significant commitments of management resources and capital investments and may not grow our revenues at the rate we expect or at all. As a result, we may not be able to recover the costs incurred in developing our new projects and initiatives or to realize their intended or projected benefits, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We may not be able to fund theme park capital expenditures and investment in future attractions and projects. A principal competitive factor for a theme park is the originality and perceived quality of its rides and attractions. We need to make continued capital investments through maintenance and the regular addition of new rides and attractions. Our ability to fund capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and to raise capital from third parties. We cannot assure you that our operations will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to fund such costs, or that we will be able to obtain sufficient financing on adequate terms, or at all, which could cause us to delay or abandon certain projects or plans. We may not realize the benefits of developments, restructurings, acquisitions or other strategic initiatives and we may incur significant costs associated with such activities. Our business strategy may include selective expansion, both domestically and internationally, through acquisitions of assets or other strategic initiatives, such as joint ventures, that allow us to profitably expand our business and leverage our brands. For example, in 2016 we announced our partnership with Miral Asset Management LLC to develop SeaWorld Abu Dhabi, a first-of-its-kind marine life themed park on Yas Island. There is no assurance that the Miral partnership or our other strategic initiatives will be successful. In addition, on March 24, 2017, we entered into a Park Exclusivity and Concept Design Agreement and a Center Concept & Preliminary Design Support Agreement with an affiliate of ZHG Group to provide design, support and advisory services for various potential projects and granting exclusive rights in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau (collectively, the “ZHG Agreements”). The ZHG Agreements were terminated in April 2019 as a result of the contract party’s defaulting on the payment of required amounts under these agreements. Any international transactions and partnerships are subject to additional risks, including foreign and U.S. regulations on the import and export of animals, the impact of economic fluctuations in economies outside of the United States, difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations due to distance, language and cultural differences, as well as political instability and lesser degree of legal protection in certain jurisdictions, currency exchange fluctuations and potentially adverse tax consequences of overseas operations. In addition, the success of any acquisition depends on effective integration of acquired businesses and assets into our operations, which is subject to risks and uncertainties, including realization of anticipated synergies and cost savings, the ability to retain and attract personnel, the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns, and undisclosed or potential legal liabilities of acquired businesses or assets. 28 We are executing on a strategic plan to grow revenue and Adjusted EBITDA and, from time to time, identify and execute on cost reduction opportunities and take other actions designed to achieve operational efficiencies and process improvements. There is no assurance that we will be able to achieve and/or sustain the cost savings, grow our business, realize or sustain operational efficiencies or achieve other benefits that we may initially expect. In addition, such actions may result in various one-time costs and temporary operational inefficiencies and could negatively impact business and employment relationships during transitional periods. See further discussion under the caption “ Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations―Principal Factors and Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations―Costs and Expenses ” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which could adversely affect our ability to report our results of operations and financial condition accurately and in a timely manner. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Our management is likewise required, on a quarterly basis, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and to disclose any changes and material weaknesses identified through such evaluation in those internal controls. As described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, a material weakness in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting existed at December 31, 2021. The Board and management are working to develop and implement a remediation plan as soon as practicable. That said, the elements of our remediation plan, which is continuing to be developed, can only be accomplished over time, and these initiatives may not accomplish their intended effects. Failure to maintain our internal control over financial reporting could adversely impact our ability to report our financial position and results from operations on a timely and accurate basis. If our financial statements are not accurate, investors may not have a complete understanding of our operations. Likewise, if our financial statements are not filed on a timely basis, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our shares are listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business and/or we may not be able to maintain compliance with certain of our debt agreements. Moreover, failure to timely file our financial statements could cause us to be ineligible to utilize short form registration statements, which could impair our ability to obtain capital in a timely fashion to execute our business strategies or issue shares to effect an acquisition. Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities. Adverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved in the normal course of our business could reduce our profits or limit our ability to operate our business. We are subject to allegations, claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business, which may include claims by third parties, including guests who visit our theme parks, our employees, vendors, stockholders and/or regulators. We are currently subject to securities litigation and other disputes. We are also subject to audits, inspections and investigations by, or receives requests for information from, various federal and state regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”), the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“Cal-OSHA”), state departments of labor, the Florida Fish & Wildlife Commission (“FWC”), the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”), the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS” ), the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). From time to time, various parties may also bring lawsuits against us. For example, on February 11, 2020, we announced that we had entered into a settlement agreement with respect to a previously disclosed class action lawsuit commenced in 2014, captioned Baker v. SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc ., et al., Case No. 14-CV-02129-MMA (AGS) (“Baker”). The settlement required us to pay $65.0 million for claims alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as the costs of administration and legal fees and expenses. The settlement does not include or constitute an admission, concession, or finding of any fault, liability, or wrongdoing by us or any defendant. Also, in September 2018, we reached a settlement with the SEC relating to a previously disclosed SEC investigation. In connection with the settlement, without admitting or denying the substantive allegations in the SEC’s complaint, we agreed to the entry of a final judgment ordering us to pay a civil penalty of $4.0 million and enjoining us from violation of certain provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and certain rules thereunder. We discuss securities litigation and other litigation to which we are subject in greater detail in “ Item 3. Legal Proceedings ” and Note 15–Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any proceedings, audits, inspections or investigations were to be determined adversely against us or resulted in legal actions, claims, regulatory proceedings, enforcement actions, or judgments, fines, or settlements involving a payment of material sums of money, or if injunctive relief were issued against us, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Even the successful defense of legal proceedings may cause us to incur substantial legal costs and may divert management’s attention and resources. 29 Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could adversely affect our business. Our intellectual property, including our trademarks, service marks, domain names, copyrights, patent and other proprietary rights, constitutes a significant part of our value. To protect our intellectual property rights, we rely upon a combination of trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret and unfair competition laws of the United States and other countries, as well as contract provisions and third-party policies and procedures governing internet/domain name registrations. However, there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful in any given case, particularly in those countries where the laws do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. We may be unable to prevent the misappropriation, infringement or violation of our intellectual property rights, breaching any contractual obligations to us, or independently developing intellectual property that is similar to ours, any of which could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed, adversely affect our revenues or otherwise harm our business. We have obtained and applied for numerous U.S. and foreign trademark and service mark registrations and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks and service marks or other intellectual property, as appropriate. We cannot guarantee that any of our pending applications will be approved by the applicable governmental authorities. Moreover, even if the applications are approved, third parties may seek to oppose or otherwise challenge these registrations. A failure to obtain registrations for our intellectual property in the United States and other countries could limit our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and impede our marketing efforts in those jurisdictions. We are actively engaged in enforcement and other activities to protect our intellectual property rights. If it became necessary for us to resort to litigation to protect these rights, any proceedings could be burdensome, costly and divert the attention of our personnel, and we may not prevail. In addition, any repeal or weakening of laws or enforcement in the United States or internationally intended to protect intellectual property rights could make it more difficult for us to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, negatively impacting their value and increasing the cost of enforcing our rights. We may be subject to claims for infringing the intellectual property rights of others, which could be costly and result in the loss of significant intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that we do not and will not infringe the intellectual property rights of others. We have been in the past, and may be in the future, subject to litigation and other claims in the ordinary course of our business based on allegations of infringement or other violations of the intellectual property rights of others. Regardless of their merits, intellectual property claims can divert the efforts of our personnel and are often time-consuming and expensive to litigate or settle. In addition, to the extent claims against us are successful, we may have to pay substantial money damages or discontinue, modify, or rename certain products or services that are found to be in violation of another party’s rights. We may have to seek a license (if available on acceptable terms, or at all) to continue offering products and services, which may significantly increase our operating expenses. If we lose licenses and permits required to exhibit animals and/or violate laws and regulations, our business will be adversely affected. We are required to hold government licenses and permits, some of which are subject to yearly or periodic renewal, for purposes of possessing, exhibiting, and maintaining animals. Although our theme parks’ licenses and permits have always been renewed in the past, in the event that any of our licenses or permits are not renewed or any of our licenses or permits are revoked, portions of the affected theme park might not be able to remain open for purpose of displaying or retaining the animals covered by such license or permit. Such an outcome could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we are subject to periodic inspections by federal and state agencies and the subsequent issuance of inspection reports. While we believe that we comply with, or exceed, requisite care and maintenance standards that apply to our animals, government inspectors can cite us for alleged statutory or regulatory violations. In unusual instances when we are cited for an alleged deficiency, we are most often given the opportunity to correct any purported deficiencies without penalty. It is possible, however, that in some cases a federal or state regulator could seek to impose monetary fines on us. In the past, when we have been subjected to governmental claims for fines, the amounts involved were not material to our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, while unlikely, we cannot predict whether any future fines that regulators might seek to impose would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Moreover, many of the statutes under which we operate allow for the imposition of criminal sanctions. While neither of the foregoing situations are likely to occur, either could negatively affect the business, financial condition or results of operations at our theme parks. 30 Unionization activities or labor disputes may disrupt our operations and affect our profitability. Although none of our employees are currently covered under collective bargaining agreements, we cannot guarantee that our employees will not elect to be represented by labor unions in the future. For example, in the recent past, we have experienced union organizing activities and these activities were resolved favorably. If some or all of our employees were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were significantly different from our current compensation arrangements, however, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, a labor dispute involving some or all of our employees may disrupt our operations and reduce our revenues, and resolution of labor and employment-related disputes may increase our costs. Although we maintain binding policies that require employees to submit to a mandatory alternative dispute resolution procedure in lieu of other remedies, as employers, we may be subject to various employment-related claims, such as individual or class actions or government enforcement actions relating to alleged employment discrimination, employee classification and related withholding, wage-hour, labor standards or healthcare and benefit issues. Such actions, if brought against us and successful in whole or in part, may affect our ability to compete or materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. If we are unable to maintain certain commercial licenses, our business, reputation and brand could be adversely affected. We rely on a license from Sesame to use the Sesame Place trade name and trademark and certain other intellectual property rights, including titles, marks, characters, logos and designs from the Sesame Street television series within our Sesame Place theme park located in Langhorne, Pennsylvania (the “Langhorne Sesame Place”), the Sesame Place theme park we announced that will be opened in California and any additional future Sesame Place theme parks in the United States (collectively, the “Standalone Parks”) and with respect to Sesame Street themed areas within certain areas of some of our other theme parks, as well as in connection with the sales of certain Sesame Street themed products. The License Agreement with Sesame Workshop (the “Sesame License Agreement”) has an initial term through December 31, 2031, with an automatic additional 15-year extension plus a 5-year option added from each new Standalone Park opening. Our use of these intellectual property rights is subject to the approval of Sesame and the parties have certain termination rights under the Sesame License Agreement, including without limitation Sesame’s right to terminate the Sesame License Agreement in whole or in part under certain limited circumstances, including a change of control of SeaWorld (or of SeaWorld Parks and Entertainment, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of SeaWorld), our bankruptcy or uncured breach of the Sesame License Agreement, or the termination of the Sesame License Agreement regarding the Langhorne Sesame Place theme park. If we were to lose or have to renegotiate the Sesame License Agreement, our business may be adversely affected. ABI is the owner of the Busch Gardens trademarks and domain names. ABI has granted us a perpetual, exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use the Busch Gardens trademark and certain related domain names in connection with the operation, marketing, promotion and advertising of certain of our theme parks, as well as in connection with the production, use, distribution and sale of merchandise sold in connection with such theme parks. Under the license, we are required to indemnify ABI against losses related to our use of the marks. If we were to lose or have to renegotiate this license, our business may be adversely affected. Our existing debt agreements contain, and future debt agreements may contain, restrictions that may limit our flexibility in operating our business. Our existing debt agreements contain, and documents governing our future indebtedness may contain, financial and operating covenants that limit the discretion of management with respect to certain business matters. These covenants place restrictions on, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends and other distributions, make capital expenditures, make certain loans, investments and other restricted payments, enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends, engage in certain transactions with stockholders or affiliates, sell certain assets or engage in mergers, acquisitions and other business combinations, amend or otherwise alter the terms of our indebtedness, alter the business that we conduct, guarantee indebtedness or incur other contingent obligations and create liens. Our existing debt agreements also require, and documents governing our future indebtedness may require, us to meet certain financial ratios and tests. Our ability to comply with these and other provisions of the existing debt agreements is dependent on our future performance, which will be subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control. The breach of any of these covenants or non-compliance with any of these financial ratios and tests could result in an event of default under the existing debt agreements, which, if not cured or waived, could result in acceleration of the related debt and the acceleration of debt under other instruments evidencing indebtedness that may contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions. We discuss certain key covenants and financial ratios to which we are subject under our debt agreements in greater detail under the caption “Restrictive Covenants” in Note 11–Long-Term Debt to our accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and under “ Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations―Our Indebtedness―Covenant Compliance ”. Additionally, variable rate indebtedness subjects us to the risk of higher interest rates, which could cause our future debt service obligations to increase significantly. 31 Failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds, related margins, liquidity, and access to capital markets. Moody’s Investor Service and Standard & Poor’s Financial Services routinely evaluate our debt and issue ratings on our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. These ratings are based on a number of factors, which included their assessment of our financial strength, liquidity, capital structure, asset quality, and sustainability of cash flow and earnings. Due to changes in these factors, the pandemic and market conditions, we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings, which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins, liquidity and access to capital markets. For example, as of December 31, 2021, our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and Senior Unsecured Credit Facilities were rated by Standard and Poor’s Financial Services (corporate credit rated B+ with a positive outlook, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities rated BB-, and the Senior Unsecured Credit Facilities rated B-) and Moody’s Investors Service (corporate family rated B2 with a stable outlook, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities rated Ba3, and the Senior Unsecured Credit Facilities rated Caa1). We disclose these ratings to enhance the understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effects of these ratings on our costs of funds and related margins, liquidity and access to capital markets. Our borrowing costs depend, in part, on our credit ratings and any actions taken by these credit rating agencies to lower our credit ratings, could increase our borrowing costs. Our leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness. As of December 31, 2021, our total indebtedness was approximately $2.150 billion. Our high degree of leverage could have important consequences, including the following: (i) a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations is dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available for operations, capital expenditures, future business opportunities and/or share repurchases of our common stock; (ii) our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate purposes in the future may be limited; (iii) certain of the borrowings are at variable rates of interest, which will increase our vulnerability to increases in interest rates; (iv) we are at a competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors; (v) we may be unable to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions; (vi) the debt service requirements of our other indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations; and (vii) we may be vulnerable in a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business and we may be unable to carry out activities that are important to our growth. During 2021, the United States experienced increasing inflation. Increased inflation is likely to cause interest rates (including LIBOR) to increase. We do not currently have any of our debt hedged. A hypothetical increase in LIBOR of 100 bps would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $7.2 million. Increased debt service costs would adversely affect our cash flow and net income. There can be no assurance that if we intend to enter into a hedge, that we will be able to enter into hedging arrangements on favorable terms or at all. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, or to pay interest on, or to refinance indebtedness depends on and is subject to our financial and operating performance, which in turn is affected by general and regional economic, financial, competitive, business and other factors beyond our control, including the availability of financing in the banking and capital markets. If unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs, we will need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity. There can be no assurance that any refinancing of our indebtedness will be possible and any such refinancing could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants that could further restrict our business operations. We from time to time may increase the amount of our indebtedness, modify the terms of our financing arrangements, make capital expenditures, issue dividends and take other actions that may substantially increase our leverage. Despite our significant leverage, we may incur additional amounts of debt, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our significant leverage. Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that we could suffer, and our insurance costs may increase. Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that we could suffer, and our insurance costs may increase. Although we maintain various safety and loss prevention programs and carry property and casualty insurance to cover certain risks, our insurance policies do not cover all types of losses and liabilities. Additionally, many of our policies are subject to deductibles and/or self-insured retentions and co-insurance. There can be no assurance our insurance will be sufficient to cover the full extent of all losses or liabilities for which we are insured and may be significantly less than the expected and actual replacement cost of rebuilding facilities “as was” if there was a total loss. For example, we expect the majority of losses related to impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will not be covered by insurance available to us and insurers may contest coverage. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew our current insurance policies on favorable terms, or at all. In addition, if we or other theme park operators sustain significant losses or make significant insurance claims, then our ability to obtain future insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates could be materially adversely affected. 32 We may be unable to purchase or contract with third-party manufacturers for our theme park rides and attractions, or construction delays may occur and impact attraction openings . We may be unable to purchase or contract with third parties to build high quality rides and attractions and to continue to service and maintain those rides and attractions at competitive or beneficial prices, or to provide the replacement parts needed to maintain the operation of such rides. In addition, if our third-party suppliers’ financial condition deteriorates or they go out of business, we may not be able to obtain the full benefit of manufacturer warranties or indemnities typically contained in our contracts or may need to incur greater costs for the maintenance, repair, replacement or insurance of these assets. We have incurred and may in the future incur unanticipated construction delays in completing capital projects which could adversely affect ride or attraction opening dates which could impact our attendance or revenues. Further, when rides and/or attractions have downtime and/or closures, our guest experience, attendance or revenue could be adversely affected. Our operations and our ownership of property subject us to environmental requirements, and to environmental expenditures and liabilities. We incur costs to comply with environmental requirements, such as those relating to water use, wastewater and storm water management and disposal, air emissions control, hazardous materials management, solid and hazardous waste disposal, and the clean-up of properties affected by regulated materials. We have been required and continue to investigate and clean-up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases, and other releases, from current or formerly owned or operated facilities. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we generate, use and dispose of large volumes of water, including saltwater, which requires us to comply with a number of federal, state and local regulations and to incur significant expenses. Failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to fines and penalties and/or require us to incur additional expenses. Although we are not now classified as a large quantity generator of hazardous waste, we do store and handle hazardous materials to operate and maintain our equipment and facilities and have done so historically. We cannot assure you that we will not incur substantial costs to comply with new or expanded environmental requirements in the future or to investigate or clean-up new or newly identified environmental conditions, which could also impair our ability to use or transfer the affected properties and to obtain financing. Delays, restrictions, or inability to obtain or maintain permits for capital investments could impair our business. Our capital investments require regulatory permits from one or more governmental agencies in order to improve existing or build new theme parks, rides, attractions and shows. Such permits are typically issued by state agencies, but federal and local governmental permits may also be required. The requirements for such permits vary depending on the location of such capital investments. As with all governmental permitting processes, there is a degree of uncertainty as to whether a permit will be granted, the time it will take for a permit to be issued, and the conditions that may be imposed in connection with the granting of the permit. Therefore, our capital investments in certain areas may be delayed, interrupted, or suspended for varying lengths of time, causing a loss of revenue to us, increasing cost, and/or adversely affecting our results of operations. Financial distress experienced by our strategic partners or other counterparties could have an adverse impact on us. We are party to numerous contracts of varying durations. Certain of our agreements are comprised of a mixture of firm and non-firm commitments, varying tenures, and varying renewal terms, among other terms. There can be no guarantee that, upon the expiration of our contracts, we will be able to renew such contracts on terms as favorable to us, or at all. Although we attempt to assess the creditworthiness of our strategic partners and other contract counterparties, there can be no assurance as to the creditworthiness of any such strategic partner or contract counterparty. Financial distress experienced by our strategic partners or other counterparties could have an adverse impact in the event such parties are unable to pay us for the services we provide or otherwise fulfill their contractual obligations. We are exposed to the risk of loss in the event of non-performance by such strategic partners or other counterparties. Some of these counterparties may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating, market and regulatory risks, and some are experiencing, or may experience in the future, severe financial problems that have had or may have a significant impact on their creditworthiness. For example, we terminated the ZHG Agreements for non-payment of undisputed amounts owed. In addition, the sale or transfer of our common stock owned by affiliates of Hill Path, or the perception that such sales or transfers could occur, could harm the prevailing market price of shares of our common stock. Any material nonpayment or nonperformance from our contract counterparties due to inability or unwillingness to perform or adhere to contractual arrangements could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to make cash distributions to its stockholders. Furthermore, in the case of financially distressed strategic partners, such events might otherwise force such strategic partners to curtail their commercial relationships with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. 33 Tariffs or other trade restrictions could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We purchase some of our merchandise for resale and other products used in our business from entities which are located in foreign countries. Additionally, some of our ride manufacturers may be located in foreign countries or utilize components manufactured or sourced from foreign countries. These relationships expose us to risks associated with doing business globally, including changes in tariffs, quotas and other restrictions on imports (collectively, “Trade Restrictions”). The United States has increased tariffs on certain imports from China and other countries. Such Trade Restrictions have resulted in increased costs and could result in lower gross margin on impacted products and/or will likely result in increases in the cost of capital projects, unless we are able to take successfully any one or more of the following mitigating actions: increase our prices, move production to countries with no or lower tariffs or away from domestic vendors who source from China or other tariff impacted countries, or alter or cease offering certain products. Any increase in pricing, alteration of products or reduced product offering could reduce the competitiveness of our products. Furthermore, any retaliatory counter-measures imposed by countries subject to such tariffs could increase our, or our vendors’, import expenses. Additionally, even if the products we import are not directly impacted by tariffs, the imposition and maintenance of such tariffs on goods imported into the United States could cause increased prices for consumer goods, in general, which could have a negative impact on consumer spending for discretionary items reducing attendance or spending at our parks. These direct and indirect impacts of increased tariffs or Trade Restrictions implemented by the United States, both individually and cumulatively, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of future operations. Actions of activist stockholders, and such activism could adversely impact the value of our securities. We value constructive input from our stockholders and the investment community. Our Board and management team are committed to acting in the best interests of all of our stockholders. There is no assurance that the actions taken by our Board of Directors and management in seeking to maintain constructive engagement with our stockholders will be successful. Responding to actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management and our employees. Such activities could also interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plan and our long-term growth. The perceived uncertainties as to our future direction caused by activist actions could affect the market price of our securities, result in the loss of potential business opportunities and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, board members and business partners. In addition, any interference with our annual meeting process, including but not limited to a proxy contest for the election of directors at our annual meeting, could require us to incur significant legal and other advisory fees and proxy solicitation expenses and require significant time and attention by management and our Board. Hill Path Capital LP and its affiliates could be able to significantly influence our decisions and their interests may conflict with ours or yours in the future. In 2019, Hill Path Capital LP and certain of its affiliates (“Hill Path”) purchased in the aggregate, 13,214,000 shares of our common stock (the “HP Purchase”). As described more fully in our Form 8-K dated May 27, 2019, we concurrently entered into the Stockholders Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement and the Undertaking Agreement (collectively, the “HP Agreements”) with Hill Path in connection with the HP Purchase. On July 2, 2020, Hill Path filed with the SEC a Schedule 13D/A (the “Schedule 13D/A”) reporting that such persons had accumulated a total of 27,205,306 shares of our common stock, which represents approximately 36.0% of our total outstanding shares of common stock as of December 31, 2021. Also, certain funds affiliated with Hill Path have other economic interests in the Company. Please refer to their most recent Schedule 13D/A. In addition, the Hill Path Schedule 13D filed on May 1, 2017, as amended states, among other things, that Hill Path may suggest changes in our business, operations, capital structure, capital allocation, corporate governance, and other strategic matters. Under the HP Agreements, we agreed to appoint up to three Hill Path director designees (“Hill Path Designees”) to our Board of Directors of which two directors may be affiliated with Hill Path and, subject to the independence standards of the New York Stock Exchange, there must be one Hill Path Designee on each committee of the Board, as determined by Hill Path and subject to the approval of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Scott Ross, founder of Hill Path, James Chambers, a Partner at Hill Path, and Charles Koppelman, who is independent, are the Hill Path Designees. Mr. Ross currently serves as Chairman of the Board and Chairman of the Compensation Committee and also serves on the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Revenue Committee. Mr. Chambers serves as Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and also serves on the Compensation Committee and the Revenue Committee. Mr. Koppelman serves on the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Revenue Committee. For so long as Hill Path Designees remain on our Board, Hill Path will have influence with respect to our management, business plans and policies, including the appointment and removal of our officers, and nominees for director. In addition, for so long as Hill Path continues to own a significant percentage of our stock, Hill Path will be able to influence the composition of our Board of Directors and the approval of actions requiring stockholder approval. For example, for so long as Hill Path continues to own a significant percentage of our stock, Hill Path may be able to influence whether or not a change of control of our Company or a change in the composition of our Board of Directors occurs. The concentration of ownership could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of common stock as part of a sale of our Company and ultimately might affect the market price of our common stock. 34 The policies of the U.S. President and his administration or any changes to tax laws may result in a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial condition and may impact our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards. While we cannot predict the changes that the administration will make, certain policy changes regarding increases in minimum wage, limitation or restrictions on travel to the United States, foreign trade barriers, domestic travel rules, changes to labor laws or regulations, and/or changes to environmental or animal welfare regulations could adversely affect our business. Additionally, policies that strengthen the U.S. dollar against a variety of foreign currencies could impact international tourist spending, including at our theme parks. While there is currently a substantial lack of clarity and uncertainty around the likelihood, timing and details of any such policies and reforms, such policies and reforms may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the value of our securities. The President signed an Executive Order with the goal of increasing the minimum wage for federal workers and contractors to $15.00 an hour, which became effective January 30, 2022. Additionally, the new administration is encouraging Congress to increase the federal minimum wage more broadly to $15.00 an hour in the private sector. Separately, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), which was enacted on December 22, 2017, contained a number of changes to U.S. federal tax laws. The Tax Act, among other changes, imposed limitations on the deductibility of interest. Additionally, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) temporarily revised the U.S. tax code by, among other changes, deferring the 2020 employer portion of social security payments, implementing an employee retention credit, and allowing for 100% utilization of net operating loss carryforwards against 2020 taxable income. On December 28, 2020, a second stimulus bill was enacted which enhanced the CARES Act by, among other changes, extending the employee retention credit, extending the work opportunity credit, and allowing for 100% deduction for certain business meals through the year 2022. The relationship between the United States and foreign countries could impact consumers’ willingness to spend discretionary income, the availability and/or cost of goods, the availability of international flights, and/or the ability or desire of foreign tourists to visit the United States. For example, the current administration announced a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympic Games and has discussed additional trade restrictions on Russia. Additional guidance may be issued by the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, the Department of the Treasury, or other governing body that may significantly differ from our interpretation of the law, which may result in a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial conditions . We continue to monitor changes and proposed changes to tax and other laws that may impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition and liquidity. It is currently unclear how the agenda of the new administration will impact our business. Changes to, or the elimination of, LIBOR may adversely affect interest expense related to our indebtedness. Borrowings under our Term B Loan which mature on August 25, 2028, and the Revolving Credit Facility which matures on August 25, 2026 are currently based on LIBOR. In March 2021, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), a regulator of financial services firms and financial markets in the United Kingdom, announced that it will phase out of regulatory oversight of LIBOR interest rates indices. The FCA has indicated it will support the LIBOR indices for USD dollar LIBOR through June 2023, to allow for an orderly transition to an alternative reference rate. There is no assurance that dates announced by the FCA will not change or that the administrator of LIBOR and/or regulators will not take further action that could impact the availability, composition, or characteristics of LIBOR or the currencies and/or tenors for which LIBOR is published. If LIBOR ceases to exist and the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes ensues, there are no guarantees whether the composition or characteristics of any such alternative, successor or replacement reference rate will be similar to, or produce the same value or economic equivalence of, the LIBOR Rate or have the same volume or liquidity as did the London interbank offered rate prior to its discontinuance or unavailability. Also, if we intend to hedge our LIBOR denominated debt, we cannot predict whether hedging opportunities will exist on acceptable terms. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee, which was charged with determining a replacement for LIBOR, has proposed the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), as its recommended alternative to LIBOR and will be adjusted by an undetermined fallback rate dependent upon the tenor of the loan. Subsequent to that recommendation, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2018-16, Derivatives and Hedging which includes SOFR as a permitted rate that can be used in the application of hedge accounting pursuant to adoption of the standard. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing SOFR rates in April 2018. SOFR is intended to be a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities. The market transition away from LIBOR is expected to be gradual and complicated, and to include the development of term and credit adjustments with a fallback rate to accommodate differences between LIBOR and SOFR. There can be no guarantee that SOFR will become widely used or that alternatives may be developed without additional complications. We are not able to predict whether LIBOR will cease to be available after 2023, whether SOFR will become a widely accepted benchmark in place of LIBOR, what fallback rate will be determined, or what the impact of such a possible transition from LIBOR may be on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 35 If COVID-19 vaccination of employees is mandated, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) published an Emergency Temporary Standard (the “ETS”) requiring all employers with at least 100 employees to ensure that their employees are fully vaccinated or require unvaccinated workers to be tested at least once a week. While the ETS was withdrawn by OSHA on January 26, 2022, it also serves as a proposed rule for a permanent Coronavirus or infectious disease standard as part of the notice-and-comment rulemaking process. If a permanent infectious disease standard becomes effective and we are required to comply with these regulations, given the current labor environment, this regulation could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of employees to operate our parks which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, if testing is an option, and the government does not cover the cost of testing, there are inadequate testing supplies or equipment for rapid testing, or significant numbers of employees require testing this could also materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations. Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock Our stock price may change significantly, and you may not be able to sell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid or at all, and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result. The trading price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile. Since shares of our common stock were sold in our IPO in April 2013 through December 31, 2021, our common stock close price has ranged from $7.46 to $69.00. In addition to the risk factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the trading price of our common stock may be adversely affected due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: • results of operations that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors; • results of operations that vary from those of our competitors; • changes in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates and investment recommendations by securities analysts and investors; • declines in the market prices of stocks generally, or those of amusement and theme parks companies; • strategic actions by us or our competitors; • announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, new products, acquisitions, joint marketing relationships, joint ventures, other strategic relationships or capital commitments; • changes in general economic or market conditions or trends in our industry or markets; • changes in business or regulatory conditions; • future sales of our common stock or other securities; • repurchases of our common stock; • investor perceptions or the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment alternatives; • the public’s response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the SEC; • rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry, particularly with respect to strategic transactions; • announcements relating to litigation; • guidance, if any, that we provide to the public, any changes in this guidance or our failure to meet this guidance; • the development and sustainability of an active trading market for our stock; • actions by institutional or activist stockholders; • changes in accounting principles; and • other events or factors, including those resulting from pandemics, natural disasters, war, acts of terrorism or responses to these events. 36 We cannot guarantee that our allocation of capital to various alternatives will enhance long-term stockholder value, and in some cases, our Share Repurchase Program could increase the volatility of the price of our common stock. Our goal is to invest capital to maximize our overall long-term returns. This includes spending on capital projects and expenses, managing debt levels, and periodically returning capital to our stockholders through share repurchases and/or dividends. There can be no assurance that our capital allocation decisions will enhance stockholder value. Our Board has previously authorized a share repurchase of up to $250.0 million of our common stock (the “Share Repurchase Program”), of which approximately $21.8 million remained available under the Share Repurchase Program as of December 31, 2021. The number of shares to be purchased and the timing of purchases will be based on our trading windows and available liquidity, general business and market conditions and other factors, including legal requirements and alternative opportunities. The Build Back Better Act, which has not been passed by the Senate, contains a number of proposed changes to U.S. federal tax laws. One such change is a proposed 1% excise tax on share repurchases, which may impact our future decisions on how to return value to shareholders in the most tax efficient manner and would increase the cost of share repurchases. During 2021, we completed share repurchases of 3,692,794 shares for an aggregate total of approximately $215.7 million. Repurchases of our common stock pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. The existence of the Share Repurchase Program could cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. There can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock. Although the Share Repurchase Program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, there is no assurance that it will do so and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce such program’s effectiveness. See Note 20–Stockholders’ (Deficit) Equity in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Future sales, or the perception of future sales, by us or our existing stockholders in the public market could cause the market price for our common stock to decline. The sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could harm the prevailing market price of shares of our common stock. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. Shares held by Hill Path and certain of our directors, officers and employees are eligible for resale, subject to volume, manner of sale and other limitations under Rule 144. In addition, pursuant to a registration rights agreement entered into in connection with the HP Purchase, we granted Hill Path the right, subject to certain conditions, to require us to register the sale of their shares of common stock under the Securities Act. If Hill Path exercises their registration rights, the market price of our shares of common stock could drop significantly. This factor could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through future offerings of our shares of common stock or other securities. In addition, the shares of our common stock reserved for future issuance under the 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan will become eligible for sale in the public market once those shares are issued, subject to provisions relating to various vesting agreements, any applicable lock-up agreements in effect from time to time and Rule 144, as applicable. A total of 15,000,000 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under the 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan, of which approximately 7,830,000 shares of common stock remain available for future issuance as of December 31, 2021. In the future, we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions. The number of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of our common stock. Any issuance of additional securities in connection with investments or acquisitions may result in additional dilution to you. Our indebtedness could limit our ability to make restricted payments such as share repurchases and/or pay dividends on our common stock in the future. Our ability to make restricted payments such as share repurchases and/or declare dividends is limited by covenants in our senior secured credit facilities pursuant to a credit agreement dated as of December 1, 2009, as the same may be amended, restated, supplemented or modified from time to time (the “Senior Secured Credit Facilities”). We have not paid a dividend since September 2016. Dividends, if any, and the timing of declaration of any such dividends, will be at the discretion of the Board and will depend upon many factors, including, but not limited to, our results of operations, financial condition, level of indebtedness, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, restrictions in our debt agreements and in any preferred stock, business prospects and other factors that the Board deems relevant. See Note 11–Long-Term Debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 37 Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control. Certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, defer or prevent a merger, acquisition, tender offer, takeover attempt or other change of control transaction that a stockholder might consider in its best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by our stockholders. These provisions provide for, among other things: • the ability of our Board of Directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock; • advance notice for nominations of directors by stockholders and for stockholders to include matters to be considered at our annual meetings; • certain limitations on convening special stockholder meetings; • the removal of directors with or without cause only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66.67% in voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of our stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class; and • that certain provisions may be amended only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66.67% in voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of our stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class. These anti-takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if the third-party’s offer may be considered beneficial by many of our stockholders. As a result, our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares. The concentration of ownership of our capital stock limits your ability to influence corporate matters. Our executive officers, directors, current 5% or greater stockholders and entities affiliated with them beneficially owned (as determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC) approximately 62.6% of our common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2021. This significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with controlling stockholders. Also, these stockholders, acting together, may be able to control our management and affairs and matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions, such as mergers, consolidations or the sale of substantially all of our assets. Consequently, this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, including a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control, even if that change of control would benefit our other stockholders. Non-U.S. holders who own or owned more than a certain ownership threshold may be subject to United States federal income tax on gains realized on the disposition of our common stock. We believe that we are currently a U.S. real property holding corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. So long as our common stock continues to be regularly traded on an established securities market, a non-U.S. stockholder who holds or held (at any time during the shorter of the five-year period preceding the date of disposition or the holder’s holding period) more than 5% of our common stock will be subject to United States federal income tax on the disposition of our common stock. Non-U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the consequences of disposing of shares of our common stock. 38 Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 2. Properties The following table summarizes our principal properties as of December 31, 2021, which includes approximately 400 acres of land available for future development. Location Size Use San Diego, CA 190 acres (a) Leased Land Chula Vista, CA 66 acres Owned Water Park (b) Orlando, FL 279 acres Owned Theme Park and Corporate Headquarters Orlando, FL 58 acres Owned All-inclusive Interactive Park Orlando, FL 81 acres Owned Water Park Tampa, FL 56 acres Owned Water Park Tampa, FL 306 acres Owned Theme Park Dade City, FL 109 acres Owned Breeding and Holding Facility Langhorne, PA 55 acres Owned Theme Park San Antonio, TX 397 acres Owned Theme Park San Antonio, TX 18 acres Owned Water Park Williamsburg, VA 222 acres Owned Water Park Williamsburg, VA 422 acres Owned Theme Park Williamsburg, VA 5 acres Owned Warehouse Space Williamsburg, VA 5 acres Owned Seasonal Worker Lodging (a) Includes approximately 17 acres of water in Mission Bay Park, California. (b) Expected to be converted to Sesame Place in 2022. We believe that our properties are in good operating condition and adequately serve our current business operations. Lease Agreement with City of San Diego Our subsidiary, Sea World LLC (f/k/a Sea World Inc.), leases approximately 190 acres from the City of San Diego, including approximately 17 acres of water in Mission Bay Park, California (the “Premises”). The current lease term commenced on July 1, 1998 and extends for 50 years or the maximum period allowed by law. Under the lease, the Premises must be used as a marine park facility and related uses. In addition, we may not operate another marine park facility within a radius of 560 miles from the City of San Diego. The annual rent under the lease is calculated on the basis of a specified percentage of Sea World LLC’s gross income from the Premises (the “Percentage Rent”), or the minimum yearly rent (the “Minimum Rent”), whichever is greater. The minimum yearly rent is adjusted every three years to an amount equal to 80% of the average accounting year rent actually paid for the three previous years. The current minimum yearly rent is approximately $10.4 million, which is subject to adjustment on January 1, 2023. The Company’s gross income from the Premises was significantly impacted during the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the temporary park closures, limited reopenings, modified operations and capacity restrictions resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related government restrictions in San Diego. As a result, the Company deferred approximately $1.6 million of the Percentage Rent related to the year ended December 31, 2020, which was subsequently paid during the first quarter of 2021.

Business Overview We are a leading theme park and entertainment company providing experiences that matter and inspiring guests to protect animals and the wild wonders of our world. We own or license a portfolio of recognized brands, including SeaWorld, Busch Gardens, Aquatica, Discovery Cove and Sesame Place. Over our more than 60-year history, we have developed a diversified portfolio of 12 differentiated theme parks that are grouped in key markets across the United States. Many of our theme parks showcase our one-of-a-kind zoological collection and feature a diverse array of both thrill and family-friendly rides, educational presentations, shows and/or other attractions with broad demographic appeal which deliver memorable experiences and a strong value proposition for our guests. Recent Developments See the discussion under “Recent Developments” in the “Business” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which includes a discussion relating to the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic on our business. For other factors concerning the current operating environment and the COVID-19 pandemic, see the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “The COVID -19 pandemic has disrupted our business and could adversely affect our results of operations and/or various other factors beyond our control could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations ”, and “ If we fail to hire and/or retain employees, our business may be adversely affected ”. Regulatory Developments See the discussion of relevant regulatory developments under “ Recent Regulatory Developments ” in the “ Business ” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a discussion of certain risks associated with federal and state regulations governing the treatment of animals, see the “ Risk Factors ” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “ Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry—We are subject to complex federal and state regulations governing the treatment of animals, which can change, and to claims and lawsuits by activist groups before government regulators and in the courts. ” 42 Principal Factors and Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations Revenues Our revenues are driven primarily by attendance in our theme parks and the level of per capita spending for admission and per capita spending for food and beverage, merchandise and other in-park products. We define attendance as the number of guest visits. Attendance drives admissions revenue as well as total in-park spending. Admissions revenue primarily consists of single-day tickets, annual passes (which generally expire after a 12-month term), season passes (including our fun card products and, collectively with annual passes, referred to as “passes” or “season passes”) or other multi-day or multi-park admission products. Revenue from these admissions products are generally recognized based on attendance. Certain pass products are purchased through monthly installment arrangements which allow guests to pay over the product’s initial commitment period. Once the initial commitment period is reached, these products transition to a month-to-month basis providing these guests access to specific parks on a monthly basis with related revenue recognized monthly. During the period each park was temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which started on March 16, 2020, we did not recognize revenue from the closed park's admission products. Total revenue per capita, defined as total revenue divided by total attendance, consists of admission per capita and in-park per capita spending: • Admission Per Capita. We calculate admission per capita as total admissions revenue divided by total attendance. Admission per capita is primarily driven by ticket pricing, the admissions product mix (including the impact of pass visitation rates), and the park attendance mix, among other factors. The admissions product mix, also referred to as the attendance or visitation mix, is defined as the mix of attendance by ticket category such as single day, multi-day, annual/season passes or complimentary tickets and can be impacted by the mix of guests as domestic and international guests generally purchase higher admission per capita ticket products than our local guests. A higher mix of complimentary tickets will lower our admissions per capita. Pass visitation rates are the number of visits per pass. A higher number of visits per pass would yield a lower admissions per capita as the revenue is recognized over more visits. The park attendance mix is defined as the mix of theme parks visited and can impact admission per capita based on the theme park’s respective pricing which, on average, is lower for our water parks compared to our other theme parks. • In-Park Per Capita Spending. We calculate in-park per capita spending as total food, merchandise and other revenue divided by total attendance. Food, merchandise and other revenue primarily consists of food and beverage, merchandise, parking and other in-park products and also includes other miscellaneous revenue, including online transaction fees, not necessarily generated in our parks, which is not significant in the periods presented. In-park per capita spending is primarily driven by pricing changes, new product offerings, the mix of guests (such as local, domestic or international guests), guest penetration levels (percentage of guests purchasing) and the mix of in-park spending, among other factors. See further discussion in the “ Results of Operations ” section which follows and in Note 2–Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For other factors affecting our revenues, see the “ Risk Factors ” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Attendance The level of attendance in our theme parks is generally a function of many factors, including affordability, the opening of new attractions and shows, competitive offerings, weather, marketing and sales efforts, awareness and type of ticket and park offerings, travel patterns of both our domestic and international guests, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and global and regional economic conditions, consumer confidence, the external perceptions of our brands and reputation, industry best practices and perceptions as to safety. The external perceptions of our brands and reputation have at times impacted relationships with some of our business partners, including certain ticket resellers that have terminated relationships with us and other zoological-themed attractions. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe the level of attendance in our theme parks, including the mix of attendance from certain markets and certain guests, has been and will continue to be impacted by public concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of reported local cases of COVID-19, domestic and international travel restrictions, federal, state and local regulations related to public places, limits on social gatherings, the availability and/or effectiveness of vaccines for adults and children, and overall public safety sentiment. We continuously monitor factors impacting our attendance, making strategic operations, marketing and sales adjustments as necessary. As approved vaccines continue to be distributed, the operating environment has improved and COVID-19 related capacity limitations have been eliminated; however, there can be no certainty of the extent and effectiveness of the vaccines or how they will impact these factors and others, including domestic or international travel, group events and group-related attendance, public opinion concerning social gatherings, consumer behavior or federal, state and local regulations related to health protocols, capacity limitations and social gatherings . See the “ Risk Factors ” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. See discussion on seasonality of our attendance in the “ Seasonality ” section which follows. 43 Costs and Expenses Historically, the principal costs of our operations are employee wages and benefits, driven partly by staffing levels, advertising, maintenance, animal care, utilities and insurance. Factors that affect our costs and expenses include fixed operating costs, competitive wage pressures including minimum wage legislation, commodity prices, costs for construction, repairs and maintenance, other inflationary pressures and attendance levels, among other factors. The mix of products sold compared to the prior year period can also impact our costs as generally retail products have a higher cost of sales component than our food and beverage or other in-park offerings. We continue our focus on reducing costs, improving operating margins and streamlining our labor structure to better align with our strategic business objectives. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have spent significant time reviewing our operations and have identified meaningful cost savings opportunities which we believe will further strengthen our business as we return to normalized operations. As a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, costs and expenses as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, are not necessarily indicative of costs and expenses as a percentage of revenue for any future period due in part to the impact of fixed operating costs and certain other costs which are not dependent on attendance levels, as well as certain costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. For other factors affecting our costs and expenses, see the “ Risk Factors ” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additionally, we maintain valuation allowances for certain deferred tax assets which rely on estimates and assumptions on future financial performance, which may need to be adjusted in the future. See Note 13–Income Taxes in our notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details. We make annual investments to support and improve our existing theme park facilities and attractions. Maintaining and improving our theme parks, as well as opening new attractions, is critical to remain competitive, grow revenue, and increase our guests’ length of stay. For further discussion of our new and planned attractions, see “ Capital Improvements ” in the “Business” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Seasonality The theme park industry is seasonal in nature. Historically, we generate the highest revenues in the second and third quarters of each year, in part because seven of our theme parks were historically only open for a portion of the year. As a result, approximately two-thirds of our attendance and revenues were historically generated in the second and third quarters of the year and we generally incurred a net loss in the first and fourth quarters. The percent mix of revenues by quarter is relatively constant each year, but revenues can shift between the first and second quarters due to the timing of Easter and spring break holidays and between the first and fourth quarters due to the timing of holiday breaks around Christmas and New Year. Even for our theme parks which have historically been open year-round, attendance patterns have significant seasonality, driven by holidays, school vacations and weather conditions. Changes in school calendars that impact traditional school vacation breaks could also impact attendance patterns. Due in part to the temporary park closures in 2020, along with capacity limitations and/or modified/limited operations and other COVID-19 related impacts on our attendance, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the seasonality of our business and it is difficult to estimate how the COVID-19 pandemic will impact seasonality in the future. Furthermore, any changes to the operating schedule of a park such as increasing operating days for our historically seasonal parks, could change the impact of seasonality in the future. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we began year-round operations at our SeaWorld park in Texas and began to operate on select days on a year round basis at both our Busch Gardens park in Virginia and our Sesame Place park in Pennsylvania. See “ Risk Factors” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial performance. Results of Operations The following discussion provides an analysis of our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic materially impacted our revenue and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to the temporary park closures, effective on March 16, 2020, capacity limitations, and modified/limited operations associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, our operating results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 are not directly comparable to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. Our business continues to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic; however, we have seen improvement in operating results during the year ended December 31, 2021 due in part to an improving operating environment along with the impact of strategic measures we have taken both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. 44 See “ Attendance ” section previously discussed and “ Risk Factors ” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 The following data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following table presents key operating and financial information for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020: For the Year Ended December 31, Variance 2021 2020 # % Selected Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) Data: (In thousands, except per capita data and %) Net revenues: Admissions $ 851,891 $ 255,376 $ 596,515 NM Food, merchandise and other 651,839 176,403 475,436 NM Total revenues 1,503,730 431,779 1,071,951 NM Costs and expenses: Cost of food, merchandise and other revenues 114,287 36,712 77,575 NM Operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below) 622,419 388,473 233,946 60.2 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 184,871 94,885 89,986 94.8 % Severance and other separation costs 1,531 2,826 (1,295 ) (45.8 %) Depreciation and amortization 148,660 150,546 (1,886 ) (1.3 %) Total costs and expenses 1,071,768 673,442 398,326 59.1 % Operating income (loss) 431,962 (241,663 ) 673,625 NM Other expense, net 144 276 (132 ) (47.8 %) Interest expense 116,642 100,907 15,735 15.6 % Loss on early extinguishment of debt and write-off of discounts and debt issuance costs 58,827 — 58,827 ND Income (loss) before income taxes 256,349 (342,846 ) 599,195 NM Benefit from income taxes (164 ) (30,525 ) 30,361 NM Net income (loss) $ 256,513 $ (312,321 ) $ 568,834 NM Other data: Attendance 20,203 6,373 13,830 NM Total revenue per capita $ 74.43 $ 67.75 $ 6.68 9.9 % Admission per capita $ 42.17 $ 40.07 $ 2.10 5.2 % In-park per capita spending $ 32.26 $ 27.68 $ 4.58 16.5 % NM-Not meaningful ND-Not determinable Admissions revenue . Admissions revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $596.5 million, or 233.6%, to $851.9 million as compared to $255.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The improvement was a result of an increase in attendance and admissions per capita. Total attendance for 2021 increased by approximately 13.8 million guests when compared to 2020. Attendance improved primarily due to an increase in demand and approximately 90% more operating days resulting from a return to more normalized operations in 2021 compared to 2020, which was significantly impacted by the temporary park closures. The increase in operating days more than offset unfavorable impacts on attendance from COVID-19 related impacts including capacity limitations and/or modified/limited operations for some of 2021. Admission per capita increased by 5.2% to $42.17 in 2021 compared to $40.07 in 2020. Admission per capita increased primarily due to the realization of higher prices in our admission products resulting from our strategic pricing efforts, which was largely offset by the net impact of the park attendance mix and admissions product mix when compared to 2020 due in part to the limited operating days and temporary park closures. 45 Food, merchandise and other revenue . Food, merchandise and other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $475.4 million, or 269.5% to $651.8 million as compared to $176.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase largely results from the increase in attendance discussed above. In-park per capita spending increased by 16.5%, to $32.26 in 2021 from $27.68 in 2020. In park per capita spending improved due to a combination of factors including, an improved product mix, the impact of new or enhanced and expanded in-park offerings and higher realized prices when compared to 2020. We believe we also benefited from a strong consumer demand environment which contributed to higher guest spending levels when compared to the prior year. Costs of food, merchandise and other revenues. Costs of food, merchandise and other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $77.6 million, or 211.3%, to $114.3 million as compared to $36.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase primarily relates to the increase in attendance as discussed above. These costs represent 17.5% and 20.8% of related revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease as a percent of related revenue primarily reflects a return to more normalized operations and the impact of sourcing cost savings initiatives combined with higher realized prices on our in-park products, which more than offset inflationary pressures. Operating expenses . Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $233.9 million, or 60.2% to $622.4 million as compared to $388.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Operating expenses in 2020 were significantly impacted by limited operating days and hours, furloughs and workforce reductions resulting from limited reopenings and temporary park closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, the increase in operating expenses during 2021 primarily results from a return to more normalized operations. In particular, operating expenses increased largely due to labor-related and other operating costs to staff and operate open parks in a more normalized environment, partially offset by structural cost savings initiatives when compared to the prior year. Operating expenses in 2021 were also impacted by approximately $11.9 million of certain nonrecurring contractual liabilities and legal costs resulting from the temporary COVID-19 park closures, an increase of approximately $9.1 million in non-cash equity compensation expenses, and operating costs associated with incremental events added in 2021. The increase in non-cash equity compensation expense partly relates to the impact of certain performance vesting restricted awards which were previously not considered probable of vesting. See Note 15–Commitments and Contingencies and Note 19–Equity-Based Compensation to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. Operating expenses as a percent of revenue were 41.4% for 2021 and are not comparable to 2020 primarily due to the impact of certain operating costs in 2020 which are not dependent on attendance levels. Selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $90.0 million, or 94.8% to $184.9 million as compared to $94.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the impact of approximately $12.5 million in legal settlement proceeds in 2020, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $77.5 million primarily due to increased marketing-related costs, an increase of $23.2 million in non-cash equity compensation expense and an increase in labor-related costs resulting from the impact of furloughs in 2020, partially offset by the impact of cost savings and efficiency initiatives. The increased marketing-related costs result from a return to more normalized operations in 2021 as we substantially reduced marketing-related costs due to limited reopenings and temporary park closures in 2020. The increase in non-cash equity compensation expense partly relates to the impact of certain performance vesting restricted awards which were previously not considered probable of vesting. See Note 15–Commitments and Contingencies and Note 19–Equity-Based Compensation to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue were 12.3% for the year ended December 31, 2021 and are not comparable to 2020 primarily due to the impact of the temporary park closures. Severance and other separation costs. Severance and other separation costs for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased by $1.3 million, or 45.8%, to $1.5 million as compared to $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Severance and other termination costs in 2021 primarily relate to positions which were eliminated in 2021. Severance and other termination costs in 2020 primarily relates to the 2020 Restructuring Program . See Note 21–Severance and Other Separation Costs in our notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased by $1.9 million, or 1.3% to $148.7 million as compared to $150.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease primarily relates to a decline in asset additions, particularly in 2020, in part due to strategic efforts as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic along with the impact of asset retirements and fully depreciated assets. Interest expense. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $15.7 million, or 15.6% to $116.6 million as compared to $100.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase primarily relates to the net impact of interest on the Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes issued in August 2020, the First-Priority Senior Secured Notes issued in April 2020, and the Senior Notes issued in August 2021, partially offset by the impact of a lower average outstanding balance on our Revolving Credit Facility, which was undrawn in 2021, the impact of decreased LIBOR rates and a lower average outstanding balance on our Term Loans. See Note 11 –Long-Term Debt to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the “ Our Indebtedness ” section which follows for further details. 46 Loss on early extinguishment of debt and write-off of discounts and debt issuance costs. Loss on early extinguishment of debt and write-off of discounts and debt issuance costs for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily relate to a write-off of discounts and debt issuance costs resulting from the Refinancing Transactions during the year ended December 31, 2021 . See Note 11–Long-Term Debt to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K and the “ Our Indebtedness” section which follows for further details. Benefit from income taxes. Benefit from income taxes was $0.2 million and $30.5 million in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our consolidated effective tax rate was -0.1% for 2021 compared to 8.9% for 2020. The effective tax rate decreased primarily due to non-cash valuation allowance adjustments on federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and federal tax credits, impacts from equity-based compensation and changes in state tax rates. See Note 13–Income Taxes in our notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. Supplemental comparison of the year ended December 31, 2021 to the year ended December 31, 2019 We believe a comparison of selected financial results for the year ended December 31, 2021 to the year ended December 31, 2019 may provide additional insight on our business as 2019 was prior to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, the following supplemental discussion provides an analysis of selected operating results for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. For the Year Ended December 31, Variance 2021 2019 # % Selected Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) Data: (In thousands, except per capita data and %) Net revenues: Admissions $ 851,891 $ 802,834 $ 49,057 6.1 % Food, merchandise and other 651,839 595,410 56,429 9.5 % Total revenues 1,503,730 1,398,244 105,486 7.5 % Selected costs and expenses: Cost of food, merchandise and other revenues 114,287 108,953 5,334 4.9 % Operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below) 622,419 649,657 (27,238 ) (4.2 %) Selling, general and administrative expenses 184,871 261,701 (76,830 ) (29.4 %) Other data: Attendance 20,203 22,624 (2,421 ) (10.7 %) Total revenue per capita $ 74.43 $ 61.80 $ 12.63 20.4 % Admission per capita $ 42.17 $ 35.48 $ 6.69 18.9 % In-park per capita spending $ 32.26 $ 26.32 $ 5.94 22.6 % Admissions revenue . Admissions revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $49.1 million, or 6.1%, to $851.9 million as compared to $802.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in admissions revenue was primarily a result of an increase in admissions per capita which more than offset a decrease in attendance of approximately 2.4 million guests, or 10.7%. Admission per capita increased by 18.9% to $42.17 in 2021 compared to $35.48 in 2019. Admission per capita increased primarily due to the realization of higher prices in our admission products resulting from our strategic pricing efforts, along with the net impact of the admissions product mix when compared to 2019. Attendance declined when compared to 2019 primarily due to COVID-19 related impacts including capacity limitations and/or modified/limited operations at our parks for part of 2021. Attendance was also impacted by a decline from international guest visitation and group-related attendance when compared to 2019. Excluding international guest visitation and group-related attendance, attendance increased by approximately 2% when compared to 2019. Food, merchandise and other revenue. Food, merchandise and other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $56.4 million, or 9.5%, to $651.8 million as compared to $595.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily as a result of an increase in in-park per capita spending, partially offset by a decrease in attendance as discussed above. In-park per capita spending increased by 22.6% to $32.26 in 2021 compared to $26.32 in 2019. In-park per capita spending improved due to a combination of factors including an improved product mix, higher realized prices and fees and the impact of new, enhanced or expanded in-park offerings when compared to 2019. We believe we also benefited from a strong consumer demand environment which contributed to higher guest spending levels when compared to 2019. Costs of food, merchandise and other revenues. Costs of food, merchandise and other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $5.3 million, or 4.9%, to $114.3 million as compared to $109.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. These costs represent 17.5% and 18.3% of the related revenue earned for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2019, respectively. 47 The decrease as a percent of related revenue relates to the impact of sourcing cost savings initiatives combined with higher realized prices on some of our in-park products , which more than offset inflationary pressures . Operating expenses. Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased $27.2 million, or 4.2%, to $622.4 million as compared to $649.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease is primarily due to a net reduction in labor-related costs and other operating costs primarily resulting from structural cost savings initiatives and the impact of modified/limited operations due to COVID-19, partially offset by approximately $11.9 million of certain nonrecurring contractual liabilities and legal costs impacted by the temporary COVID-19 park closures, operating costs associated with incremental operating days and events added in 2021 and an increase of approximately $5.5 million in non-cash equity compensation expense. The increase in non-cash equity compensation expense partly relates to the impact of certain performance vesting restricted awards which were previously not considered probable of vesting. See Note 15–Commitments and Contingencies and Note 19–Equity-Based Compensation to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. Operating expenses were 41.4% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 46.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Selling, general and administrative expenses . Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased $76.8 million, or 29.4%, to $184.9 million as compared to $261.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease primarily relates to the following factors: (i) a targeted reduction in marketing related costs; (ii) a decrease in legal costs primarily related to a legal settlement charge in 2019, net of insurance recoveries, of approximately $32.1 million; (iii) a decline in third-party consulting costs; and (iv) the impact of cost savings and efficiency initiatives. These factors were partially offset by an increase of $23.1 million in non-cash equity compensation expense (as discussed above). See Note 15–Commitments and Contingencies and Note 19–Equity-Based Compensation to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. As a percentage of total revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses were 12.3% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 18.7% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Generally, our principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations, funds from borrowings and existing cash on hand. Our principal uses of cash include the funding of working capital obligations, debt service, investments in theme parks (including capital projects), share repurchases and/or other return of capital to stockholders, when permitted. As of December 31, 2021, we had a working capital ratio (defined as current assets divided by current liabilities) of 1.5, due in part to our outstanding cash balance at December 31, 2021. Historically, we typically have operated with a working capital ratio of less than 1 due to significant deferred revenue balance from revenues paid in advance for our theme park admissions products and high turnover of in-park products that result in limited inventory balances. Our cash flow from operations, along with our revolving credit facilities, have historically allowed us to meet our liquidity needs. As market conditions warrant and subject to our contractual restrictions and liquidity position, we or our affiliates may from time to time purchase our outstanding equity and/or debt securities, including our outstanding bank loans in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Any such purchases may be funded by incurring new debt, including additional borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Any new debt may also be secured debt. We may also use available cash on our balance sheet. The amounts involved in any such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. Further, since some of our debt may trade at a discount to the face amount among current or future syndicate members, any such purchases may result in our acquiring and retiring a substantial amount of any particular series, with the attendant reduction in the trading liquidity of any such series. Depending on conditions in the credit and capital markets and other factors, we will, from time to time, consider other financing transactions, the proceeds of which could be used to refinance our indebtedness or for other purposes. Share Repurchases See Note 20–Stockholders’ (Deficit) Equity in our notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on the Share Repurchase Program. Other We believe that existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet the capital expenditures, debt service obligations, and working capital requirements of our operations for at least the next 12 months. 48 The following table presents a summary of our cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 503,012 $ (120,729 ) $ 348,416 Net cash used in investing activities (128,854 ) (109,175 ) (195,193 ) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (364,897 ) 624,204 (147,305 ) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash $ 9,261 $ 394,300 $ 5,918 Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $503.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to net cash used in operating activities of $120.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities was primarily impacted by improved operating performance, including increased sales of admission and other products, partially offset by the impact of increased interest payments in the year ended December 31, 2021 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, which was impacted by the temporary park closures. Net cash used in operating activities was $120.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $348.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities in 2020 was primarily impacted by the decline in revenue due to the temporary park closures and limited park reopenings. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Investing activities consist principally of capital investments we make in our theme parks for future attractions and infrastructure. Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 consisted of capital expenditures of $128.9 million largely related to future attractions (see further breakdown of capital expenditures in the table below). Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted of capital expenditures of $109.2 million. The following table presents detail of our capital expenditures for the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Capital Expenditures: (Unaudited, in thousands) Core (a) $ 69,402 $ 94,671 $ 171,789 Expansion/ROI projects (b) 59,452 14,504 23,428 Capital expenditures, total $ 128,854 $ 109,175 $ 195,217 (a) Reflects capital expenditures for park rides, attractions and maintenance activities. (b) Reflects capital expenditures for park expansion, new properties, or other revenue and/or expense return on investment (“ROI”) projects. The amount of our capital expenditures may be affected by general economic and financial conditions, among other things, including restrictions imposed by our borrowing arrangements. Historically, we generally expect to fund our capital expenditures through our operating cash flow, which was materially impacted in 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we took proactive measures starting in March 2020 relating to our capital expenditures including delaying the opening of certain new rides which were originally scheduled to open in 2020 and are now scheduled to open in 2022. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 results primarily from $215.7 million used to repurchase shares, net debt repayments of $133.8 million, which includes the Refinancing Transactions and payments on the Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes, and the payment of tax withholdings on equity-based compensation through shares withheld of $14.5 million. The Refinancing Transactions primarily consisted of $1,934.6 million in repayments of our Term B-5 Loans and Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes, approximately $34.3 million related to a premium paid for redemption of our Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes, and approximately $23.3 million in debt issuance costs partially offset by net proceeds from our Term B Loans and the Senior Notes of $1,922.2 million. Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 results primarily from net proceeds from our First-Priority Senior Secured Notes and our Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes offering of $713.7 million, partially offset by net repayments on our revolving credit facility of $50.0 million, repayments of $15.5 million on our long-term debt, $12.4 million used to repurchase shares early in the first quarter of 2020 and $7.5 million of debt issuance costs paid in connection with the issuance of the First-Priority Senior Secured Notes and Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes, and as a result of amendments to our senior secured credit facilities. 49 See Note 11–Long-Term Debt to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. Our Indebtedness We are a holding company and conduct our operations through our subsidiaries, which have incurred or guaranteed indebtedness as described below. As of December 31, 2021, our indebtedness consisted of senior secured credit facilities, 8.75% first-priority senior secured notes (the “First-Priority Senior Secured Notes”) and 5.25% senior notes due 2029 (the “Senior Notes”). See discussion which follows and Note 11–Long-Term Debt to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details related to our indebtedness and related debt transactions. Senior Secured Credit Facilities SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc. (“SEA”) is the borrower under the senior secured credit facilities, as amended and restated pursuant to a credit agreement (the “Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”) dated August 25, 2021 (the “Senior Secured Credit Facilities”). As of December 31, 2021, our Senior Secured Credit Facilities consisted of $1.197 billion in Term B Loans, which will mature in August 2028, along with a $385.0 million Revolving Credit Facility, which had no amounts outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and will mature in August 2026. As of December 31, 2021, SEA had approximately $20.5 million of outstanding letters of credit, leaving approximately $364.5 million available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility. First-Priority Senior Secured Notes, Senior Notes and Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes On April 30, 2020, SEA closed on a private offering of $227.5 million aggregate principal amount of 8.750% First-Priority Senior Secured Notes. On August 5, 2020, SEA closed on a private offering of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9.500% second-priority senior secured notes (the “Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes”), which were fully redeemed during the year ended December 31, 2021. On August 25, 2021, SEA closed on a private offering of $725.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.250% senior notes due 2029 (the “Senior Notes”). Covenant Compliance As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all covenants in the credit agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indentures governing our Senior Notes and First-Priority Senior Secured Notes. See Note 11–Long-Term Debt to our consolidated financial statements for further details relating to our restrictive covenants. Adjusted EBITDA We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus (i) income tax (benefit) provision, (ii) interest expense, consent fees and similar financing costs, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) equity-based compensation expense, (v) loss on extinguishment of debt, (vi) non-cash charges/credits related to asset disposals, (vii) certain business optimization, development and strategic initiative costs, (viii) merger, acquisition, integration and certain investment costs, and (ix) other nonrecurring costs including incremental costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic or similar unusual events. Under the credit agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indentures governing our Senior Notes and First-Priority Senior Secured Notes (collectively, the “Debt Agreements”), our ability to engage in activities such as incurring additional indebtedness, making investments, refinancing certain indebtedness, paying dividends and entering into certain merger transactions is governed, in part, by our ability to satisfy tests based on Adjusted EBITDA as defined in the Debt Agreements (“Covenant Adjusted EBITDA”). Covenant Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Adjusted EBITDA plus certain other items as defined in the Debt Agreements, including estimated cost savings among other adjustments. Cost savings represent annualized estimated savings expected to be realized over the following 24 month period related to certain specified actions including restructurings and cost savings initiatives, net of actual benefits realized during the last twelve months. Other adjustments include (i) recruiting and retention costs, (ii) public company compliance costs, (iii) litigation and arbitration costs, and (iv) other costs and adjustments as permitted by the Debt Agreements. 50 We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate as it eliminates the effect of certain non-cash and other items not necessarily indicative of a company’s underlying operating performance. We use Adjusted EBITDA in connection with certain components of our executive compensation program. In addition, investors, lenders, financial analysts and rating agencies have historically used EBITDA related measures in our industry, along with other measures, to estimate the value of a company, to make informed investment decisions and to evaluate companies in the industry. In addition, we believe the presentation of Covenant Adjusted EBITDA for the last twelve months is appropriate as it provides additional information to investors about the calculation of, and compliance with, certain financial covenants in the Debt Agreements. See Note 11–Long-Term Debt to our consolidated financial statements for further details relating to our restrictive covenants. Adjusted EBITDA and Covenant Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for a measure of our financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and are not indicative of income or loss from operations as determined under GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA, Covenant Adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP financial measures have limitations which should be considered before using these measures to evaluate our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA and Covenant Adjusted EBITDA as presented by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to varying methods of calculation. The following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA and Covenant Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) for the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 (In thousands) Net income (loss) $ 256,513 $ (312,321 ) $ 89,476 (Benefit from) provision for income taxes (164 ) (30,525 ) 39,528 Loss on early extinguishment of debt and write-off of discounts and debt issuance costs (a) 58,827 — — Interest expense 116,642 100,907 84,178 Depreciation and amortization 148,660 150,546 160,557 Equity-based compensation expense (b) 41,018 7,467 11,106 Loss on impairment or disposal of assets and certain non-cash expenses (c) 7,099 7,187 3,198 Business optimization, development and strategic initiative costs (d) 8,759 7,268 27,869 Certain investment costs and other taxes (e) 830 1,044 5,056 COVID-19 related incremental costs (f) 22,562 8,808 — Other adjusting items (g) 1,302 (13,567 ) 35,954 Adjusted EBITDA (h) 662,048 (73,186 ) 456,922 Items added back to Covenant Adjusted EBITDA as defined in the Debt Agreements: Estimated cost savings ( i ) 7,100 — 11,300 Other adjustments as defined in the Debt Agreements (j) 19,990 (j) (j) Covenant Adjusted EBITDA (k) $ 689,138 $ (73,186 ) $ 468,222 (a) Reflects a loss on early extinguishment of debt and write-off of discounts and debt issuance costs associated with the Refinancing Transactions. See Note 11–Long-Term Debt to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. (b) Reflects non-cash equity compensation expenses and related payroll taxes associated with the grants of equity-based compensation. For the year ended December 31, 2021, includes equity compensation expense related to certain performance vesting restricted awards which were previously not considered probable of vesting. For the year ended December 31, 2020, includes a reversal of equity compensation for certain performance vesting restricted units which at the time were no longer considered probable of vesting. See Note 19-Equity Based Compensation to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. (c) Reflects primarily non-cash expenses related to asset write-offs and costs related to certain rides and equipment which were removed from service. See Note 8–Property and Equipment, Net, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. (d) For the year ended December 31, 2021, reflects business optimization, development and other strategic initiative costs primarily related to: (i) $4.2 million of third-party consulting costs; (ii) $3.1 million of other business optimization costs and strategic initiative costs and (iii) $1.5 million of severance and other separation costs associated with positions eliminated. 51 For the year ended December 31, 2020, reflects business optimization, development and other strategic initiative costs primarily related to: ( i ) $3. 1 million of third party consulting costs and (ii) $2.8 million of severance and other separation costs primarily related to the 2020 Restructuring Program. See Note 21 – Severance and Other Separation Costs in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. For the year ended December 31, 2019, reflects business optimization, development and other strategic initiative costs primarily related to: (i) $21.2 million of third-party consulting costs and (ii) $4.2 million of severance and other separation costs associated with positions eliminated. (e) For the year ended December 31, 2019, includes approximately $4.3 million relating to expenses associated with the previously disclosed transfer of shares and HP Agreements. See Note 17–Related Party Transactions in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. (f) For the year ended December 31, 2021, includes approximately $11.9 million of nonrecurring contractual liabilities and legal costs impacted by the temporary COVID-19 park closures and approximately $9.0 million of incremental temporary labor-related costs incurred to prepare and staff the parks and other incremental, nonrecurring, temporary incentives paid to attract employees to return to or remain in the workforce during the COVID-19 related environment. For the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily includes incremental labor-related costs to prepare and operate the parks with enhanced safety measures, incremental third-party consulting costs primarily related to our COVID-19 response and safety communication strategies, contract termination or modification costs related to impacts from the temporary COVID-19 park closures, legal costs related to COVID-19 related matters, and temporary or initial purchases of safety monitoring and personal protective equipment. These costs were included with other adjusting items in the Adjusted EBITDA calculation previously reported for the year ended December 31, 2020 and have been reclassified to COVID-19 related incremental costs above to conform with the current year presentation. (g) For the year ended December 31, 2020, includes approximately $16.9 million of legal settlement proceeds partially offset by approximately $3.3 million in other legal fees. The legal settlement proceeds received in 2020 relate to the following: (i) $12.5 million of insurance proceeds related to a legal settlement gain as previously disclosed and (ii) $4.4 million related to the return of funds previously paid for a legal settlement. For the year ended December 31, 2019, includes approximately $32.1 million related to a legal settlement charge, net of insurance recoveries. See Note 15–Commitments and Contingencies in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. ( h ) Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted to exclude certain non-cash, and other items as described above. ( i ) Our Debt Agreements, which were effective for the year ended December 31, 2021, permit the calculation of certain covenants to be based on Covenant Adjusted EBITDA, as defined above, for the last twelve-month period further adjusted for net annualized estimated savings we expect to realize over the following 24-month period related to certain specified actions, including restructurings and cost savings initiatives. These estimated savings are calculated net of the amount of actual benefits realized during such period. These estimated savings are a non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA add-back item only as defined in the Debt Agreements and does not impact our reported GAAP net income (loss). For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the estimated cost savings calculation was based on annualized estimated savings we expected to realize over the following 18-month period related to certain specified actions, including restructurings and cost savings initiatives. These estimated savings were calculated net of the amount of actual benefits realized during such period and were limited to 25% of Adjusted EBITDA, calculated for the last twelve months before the impact of these estimated cost savings. ( j ) The Debt Agreements, which were effective for the year ended December 31, 2021, permit our calculation of certain covenants to be based on Covenant Adjusted EBITDA as defined above, for the last twelve-month period further adjusted for certain costs as permitted by the Debt Agreements including recruiting and retention expenses, public company compliance costs and litigation and arbitration costs, if any. Prior to the Debt Agreements, these costs were not permitted adjustments in the calculation, as such, these adjustments are not applicable to the prior years. (k) Covenant Adjusted EBITDA is defined in the Debt Agreements as Adjusted EBITDA for the last twelve-month period further adjusted for net annualized estimated savings among other adjustments as described in footnotes (i) and (j) above. 52 Contractual Obligations We had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2021. The following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations as of December 31, 2021: Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years (In thousands) Long-term debt (including current portion) ( a) $ 2,149,500 $ 12,000 $ 24,000 $ 251,500 $ 1,862,000 Interest on long-term debt (b) 664,211 101,823 206,520 174,758 181,110 Operating and finance leases (c) 298,184 23,858 24,346 23,751 226,229 Purchase obligations, license commitments and other (d) 213,086 149,865 55,987 2,067 5,167 Total contractual obligations $ 3,324,981 $ 287,546 $ 310,853 $ 452,076 $ 2,274,506 (a) Represents principal payments. See Note 11–Long-Term Debt to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. (b) Includes amounts attributable to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, Senior Notes and First-Priority Senior Notes calculated as of December 31, 2021. See Note 11–Long-Term Debt to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. (c) Represents commitments under long-term operating and finance leases requiring annual minimum lease payments, primarily consisting of the lease for the land of our SeaWorld theme park in San Diego, California. Included in the less than 1 year column is approximately $10.8 million in deferred rent payments and certain fees related to the land lease, which is accrued as of December 31, 2021. See Note 14–Leases to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. (d) We have minimum purchase commitments with various vendors through 2031. Outstanding minimum purchase commitments consist primarily of capital expenditures related to future attractions, infrastructure enhancements for existing facilities and information technology products and services. Amounts have been calculated using early termination fees or non-cancelable minimum contractual obligations by period, as applicable, under contracts that were in effect as of December 31, 2021. In addition, in connection with the Sesame License Agreement, we have made certain commitments including opening a new Sesame Place theme park. As a result, obligations related to this agreement are included in the table above. For further details, refer to Note 15–Commitments and Contingencies in our notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingencies during the reporting period. Significant estimates and assumptions include the valuation and useful lives of long-lived assets, the accounting for income taxes, the accounting for self-insurance and revenue recognition. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies which require management’s most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. For more discussion of these and other significant accounting policies, refer to Note 2–Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets All long-lived assets, including property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Assets are grouped and tested at the lowest level for which identifiable, independent cash flows are available. An impairment loss may be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset, including disposition, are less than the carrying value of the asset. The measurement of the impairment loss to be recognized is based upon the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying amounts of the assets. Fair value is generally determined based upon a discounted cash flow analysis. If significant, certain impairment indicators may trigger an impairment review. 53 Accounting for Income Taxes We are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation periods for property and equipment and deferred revenue, for tax and financial accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets. We must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets (primarily net operating loss and charitable contribution carryforwards) will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent that we believe that recovery is not more likely than not, a valuation allowance against those amounts is recorded. To the extent that we record a valuation allowance or a change in the valuation allowance during a period, we recognize these amounts as income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), contains rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change, which is generally any change in ownership of more than 50% of its stock over a rolling three-year period, to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards in years after the ownership change. These rules generally operate by focusing on ownership shifts among stockholders owning directly or indirectly 5% or more of the stock of a company and any change in ownership arising from shares of stock sold by these same stockholders. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision or benefit for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets. Management has analyzed all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard in assessing the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred income tax assets. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of the statutory carryback and carryforward periods and tax planning alternatives. Forecasted financial performance is not used as evidence until such time as the Company has cumulative pretax income for a rolling 36-month period. The assumptions about future taxable income require the use of significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying business. Through December 31, 2020, approximately $65.6 million of valuation allowances were established for some of our deferred tax assets, which, based on our analysis at the time, we believed did not meet the “more likely than not” criteria and would expire before being realized in future periods. Based on our assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets during the year ended December 31, 2021, which included a review of current and forecasted financial performance as the Company is now in a cumulative pretax income position, we now believe that some of these deferred tax assets meet the “more likely than not” criteria and will be realized in future periods before they expire. As a result, we reversed our valuation allowances by approximately $60.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, we have a remaining valuation allowance of approximately $4.8 million, net of federal tax benefit, on the deferred tax assets related to state net operating loss carryforwards. Our valuation allowances, in part, rely on estimates and assumptions related to our future financial performance. Given the macroeconomic environment related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the uncertainties regarding the related impact on financial performance, our valuation allowances may need to be adjusted in the future. For further details, also refer to Note 13–Income Taxes, in our notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Self-Insurance Reserves Reserves are recorded for the estimated amounts of guest and employee claims and expenses incurred each period that are not covered by insurance. Reserves are established for both identified claims and incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) claims. Such amounts are accrued for when claim amounts become probable and estimable. Reserves for identified claims are based upon our own historical claims experience and third-party estimates of settlement costs. Reserves for IBNR claims are based upon our own claims data history, actuarially determined loss development factors and qualitative considerations such as claims management activities . All reserves are periodically reviewed for changes in facts and circumstances and adjustments are made as necessary. Revenue Recognition Admissions revenue primarily consists of single-day tickets, annual or season passes or other multi-day or multi-park admission products. Food, merchandise and other revenue primarily consists of food and beverage, merchandise and other in-park products and also includes other miscellaneous revenue, which is not significant in the periods presented. For single-day tickets, we recognize revenue at a point in time, upon admission to the park, and for food, merchandise and other in-park products we recognize revenue when the related products or services are received by our guests. For annual or season passes and multi-use admission products, revenue is deferred and recognized over the terms of the admission product based on estimated redemption rates for similar products and is adjusted periodically. We estimate redemption rates using historical and forecasted attendance trends by park for similar products. Attendance trends factor in seasonality and are adjusted based on actual trends periodically. These estimated redemption rates impact the timing of when revenue is recognized on these products. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates based on actual attendance patterns. Revenue is recognized on a pro-rata basis based on the estimated allocated selling price of the admission product. For pass products purchased on an installment plan that have met their initial commitment period and have 54 transitioned to a month to month basis, monthly charges are recognized as revenue when payments are received each month, with the exception of payments received during the temporary park closures in 2020 . For multi-day admission products, revenue is allocated based on the number of visits included in the pass and recognized ratably based on each admission into the theme park . Certain admission products may also include bundled products at the time of purchase, such as food and beverage or merchandise items. We conduct an analysis of bundled products to identify separate distinct performance obligations that are material in the context of the contract. For those products that are determined to be distinct performance obligations and material in the context of the contract, we allocate a portion of the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation using each performance obligation’s standalone price. If the bundled product is related to a pass product and offered over time, revenue will be recognized over time accordingly. For further details, also refer to Note 4–Revenues, in our notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Inflation The impact of inflation has affected, and will continue to affect, our operations significantly. Our costs of food, merchandise and other revenues are influenced by inflation and fluctuations in global commodity prices. In addition, costs for construction, repairs and maintenance are all subject to inflationary pressures. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates, and to a lesser extent on currency exchange rates, from time to time, on imported rides and equipment. The objective of our financial risk management is to reduce the potential negative impact of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to acceptable levels. We do not acquire market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes. We previously managed interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed-rate long-term debt and interest rate swaps that fixed a portion of our variable-rate long-term debt. In May 2020, our interest rate swap agreements expired, as such, we did not have any derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2021 or 2020. We presently manage interest rate risk primarily by managing the amount, sources and duration of our debt funding. At December 31, 2021, approximately $1.2 billion of our outstanding long-term debt represents variable-rate debt. Assuming an average balance on our revolving credit borrowings of approximately $385.0 million, a hypothetical 100 bps increase in LIBOR would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $11.0 million. Assuming no revolving credit borrowings, a hypothetical 100 bps increase in LIBOR would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $7.2 million. COVID-19 Risks and Uncertainties See “ Risk Factors” for further discussion of the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial performance. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto are provided in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), require public companies, including us, to maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” which are defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act to mean a company’s controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required or necessary disclosures. 55 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. The design of any controls and procedures also is based on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, have reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2021 and, based on their evaluation, have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date due to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting initially disclosed as of September 30, 2021 and described below. Notwithstanding the above, the control deficiency did not result in a material misstatement of any of the Company’s annual or interim consolidated financial statements. Further, management believes and has concluded that the consolidated financial statements for the prior periods and included in this report fairly present, in all material respects, the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting As required by the SEC’s rules and regulations for the implementation of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company, (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors, and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements in our consolidated financial statements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. In making these assessments, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) . Based on our assessments and those criteria, management including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, identified a material weakness within the Company’s control environment. Specifically, the Company does not have sufficient policies and procedures related to Board oversight of certain Board engagement within the Company’s control environment. Accordingly, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Regulations under the Exchange Act require public companies, including our Company, to evaluate any change in our “internal control over financial reporting” as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. We have not experienced any material impact to our internal controls over financial reporting despite the fact that certain employees worked remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We are continually monitoring and assessing the COVID-19 pandemic on our internal controls to minimize the impact on their design and operating effectiveness. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recent quarter covered by this Annual Report that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting, except for remediation efforts in connection with the material weakness as described above. 56 Status Update Management and our Board of Directors are committed to remediating this deficiency. Based upon a recommendation of the Audit Committee, the Board formed a committee (the “Committee”) to develop and execute on a remediation plan. The Committee and management are in the process of developing the remediation plan and have implemented the following: • Engaged independent consultants to advise the Board’s Committee as it relates to the deficiency. • Enhanced our evaluation of the control environment. Management and our Board are committed to taking appropriate steps to remediate the deficiency. Our remediation of the identified material weakness is ongoing and will require additional time to fully remediate. The material weakness cannot be considered remediated until remediation efforts have operated for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, that the material weakness has been resolved. Additional remediation measures continue to be considered and will be implemented as appropriate. We will continue to assess the effectiveness of our remediation efforts in connection with our evaluations of internal control over financial reporting.

Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders’ (deficit) equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28, 2022, expressed an adverse opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Revenue Recognition—Deferred Revenue Related to Annual and Season Admission Pass Products—Refer to Note 2 and Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company’s annual and seasonal admission pass products allow guests access to specific parks over a specified time period. Such revenue is deferred and recognized over the terms of the admission pass product based on estimated redemption rates for similar products and is adjusted periodically. The Company estimates redemption rates using historical and forecasted attendance trends by park. Attendance trends factor in seasonality and are adjusted based on actual trends periodically. Revenue is recognized on a pro rata basis based on the estimated allocated selling price of the admission product. The Company tracks and recognizes deferred revenue utilizing internally developed models. Auditing the attendance projections by park, which is the primary input used in the deferred revenue models, and the redemption rates calculated through the models, required extensive audit effort due to the complexity and manual nature of the models. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the attendance projections by park and the recognition of revenue from the deferred revenue related to annual and seasonal admission pass products included the following, among others: F-2 • We tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over revenue recognition related to annual and season admission pass products, including controls over actual and estimated attendance and the timing of deferred revenue relief . • We performed a retrospective review on the prior year forecasted attendance by comparing actual attendance results to management’s historical forecasts in order to evaluate management’s ability to forecast attendance and identify any past bias. • We evaluated the reasonableness of the current-year attendance forecasts compared to historical results, considering recent trends in the Company’s attendance. • We tested assumptions and inputs used in the deferred revenue pass models that are used to determine the deferred revenue balances related to and the revenue recognized from annual and seasonal admission pass products. • We tested the mathematical accuracy and appropriateness of management’s deferred revenue models and timing of revenue recognition. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Tampa, Florida February 28, 2022 We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2009. F-3 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness identified below on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 of the Company and our report dated February 28, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Material Weakness A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weakness has been identified and included in management's assessment: The Company does not have sufficient policies and procedures related to Board oversight of certain Board engagement within the Company’s control environment. This material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, of the Company, and this report does not affect our report on such financial statements. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Tampa, Florida February 28, 2022 F-4 SEAWORLD ENTERTAINMENT, INC.

(“SEA”) (collectively, the “Company”), owns and operates twelve theme parks within the United States. Prior to December 1, 2009, the Company did not have any operations. On December 1, 2009, the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity interest of Busch Entertainment LLC and affiliates from Anheuser Busch Companies, Inc. and Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (“ABI”). The Company completed an initial public offering in April 2013. See further discussion relating to subsequent ownership changes in Note 17–Related-Party Transactions. The Company operates SeaWorld theme parks in Orlando, Florida; San Antonio, Texas; and San Diego, California, and Busch Gardens theme parks in Tampa, Florida, and Williamsburg, Virginia. The Company operates water park attractions in Orlando, Florida (Aquatica); San Antonio, Texas (Aquatica); San Diego, California, (Aquatica, which will be converted to a Sesame Place park in 2022); Tampa, Florida (Adventure Island); and Williamsburg, Virginia (Water Country USA). The Company also operates a reservations-only theme park in Orlando, Florida (Discovery Cove) and a theme park in Langhorne, Pennsylvania (Sesame Place). During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2019, respectively, approximately 58 % and 57 % of the Company’s revenues were generated in the State of Florida which exposes the Company to risks affecting the Florida market, such as natural disasters, severe weather or other incidents. During the year ended December 31, 2020, more than 70 % of the Company’s revenues were generated in the State of Florida, due in part to the temporary park closures and limited operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. See Impact of Global COVID-19 Pandemic section which follows for further discussion. Impact of Global COVID-19 Pandemic The Company’s results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were impacted by the global COVID-19 pandemic due in part to the following factors: (i) capacity limitations, modified/limited operations and/or temporary park closures which were in place for portions of the respective periods; (ii) decreased demand due to public concerns associated with the pandemic; (iii) restrictions on international travel and; (iv) a decline in both international and group-related attendance. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and in compliance with government restrictions, the Company temporarily closed all of its theme parks effective March 16, 2020. Beginning in June 2020, the Company began the phased reopening of some of its parks with enhanced health, safety and cleaning measures, capacity limitations and/or modified/limited operations, which at times included reduced hours and/or reduced operating days. By the end of August 2020, the Company had reopened 10 of its 12 parks on a limited basis. The Company was unable to reopen its Aquatica water park in California and its Water Country USA water park in Virginia for the 2020 operating season but opened both parks for their 2021 operating season. At the start of 2021, seven of the Company’s 12 parks were open but were operating with capacity limitations or modified/limited operations. By the end of the second quarter of 2021, all of the Company’s 12 parks were open, and operating without COVID-19 related capacity limitations. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has taken a number of proactive measures for the safety of its guests, employees and animals, to manage costs and expenditures, and to maximize liquidity in response to the temporary park closures and limited reopenings related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of the measures taken in 2020 included, but were not limited to: (i) increased its revolving credit commitments on March 10, 2020 prior to the temporary park closures; (ii) issued first-priority senior secured notes and second-priority senior secured notes in 2020 to raise additional capital and further enhance available liquidity at the time; (iii) entered into amendments to its existing senior secured credit facilities to amend financial covenants at the time; (iv) furloughed approximately 95% of its employees in 2020 upon closing all of its parks; (v) obtained payroll tax credits and deferred certain social security payroll taxes under the CARES act; (vi) temporarily reduced executive officers’ base salary by 20% through November 2020; (vii) eliminated and/or deferred all non-essential operating expenses at all of its parks and corporate headquarters while the parks were closed and actively managed operating expenses as parks reopened; (viii) eliminated substantially all advertising and marketing spend while the parks were closed and strategically managed marketing spend as parks reopened; (ix) substantially reduced or deferred all capital expenditures starting in March 2020 (other than minimal essential capital expenditures) when the parks were closed and postponed the opening of rides that were still under construction and scheduled to open in 2020; (x) worked with certain of its vendors and other business partners to manage, defer, and/or abate certain costs and payments and; (xi) added additional levels of review and approval for payments and cash disbursements which remained in place through 2021. The Company continuously monitors guidance from federal, state and local authorities and engages with governmental authorities as well as medical/scientific consultants. The Company may adjust its plans accordingly as laws change and new information and guidance becomes available. The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a material impact on the Company’s financial results. F-9 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including SEA. All intercompany accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, the accounting for self-insurance, deferred tax assets and liabilities, deferred revenue, equity compensation, the valuation of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets and reviews for potential impairment of long-lived assets. Estimates are based on various factors including current and historical trends, as well as other pertinent company and industry data. The Company regularly evaluates this information to determine if it is necessary to update the basis for its estimates and to adjust for known changes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Based on the uncertainty relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, including but not limited to the impact or timing of government restrictions, any future capacity limitations due to social distancing guidelines, public sentiment on social gatherings, travel and attendance patterns, travel restrictions, effectiveness and adoption of vaccines, the impact of new variants, potential supply chain disruptions and additional actions which could be taken by government authorities to manage the pandemic, the Company is not certain of the ultimate impact the COVID-19 pandemic could have on its estimates, business or results of operations. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash held at financial institutions as well as operating cash onsite at each theme park to fund daily operations and amounts due from third-party credit card companies with settlement terms of less than four days . The amounts due from third-party credit card companies totaled $ 11.5 million and $ 4.9 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The cash balances in all accounts held at financial institutions are insured up to $ 250,000 by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) through December 31, 2021. At times, cash balances may exceed federally insured amounts and potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk. Management believes that no significant concentration of credit risk exists with respect to these cash balances because of its assessment of the creditworthiness and financial viability of the respective financial institutions. From time to time, the Company may invest in certain highly liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less. These instruments may include money market mutual funds, certificates of deposit or time deposits, among others, which may or may not qualify for FDIC insurance. The Company classifies any such instruments as cash and cash equivalents based on their short-term maturities. Restricted Cash Restricted cash is recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Restricted cash consists primarily of funds received from strategic partners for use in approved marketing and promotional activities. December 31, December 31, 2021 2020 (In thousands) Cash and cash equivalents $ 443,707 $ 433,909 Restricted cash, included in prepaid expenses and other current assets 779 1,316 Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 444,486 $ 435,225 Accounts Receivable—Net Accounts receivable are reported at net realizable value and consist primarily of amounts due from customers for the sale of admission products, including amounts due for admissions products purchased on monthly installment arrangements. The Company is not exposed to a significant concentration of credit risk. The Company records an allowance on trade accounts receivable with an offset to the provision for bad debt for estimated credit losses expected based on its history of uncollectable accounts. For all periods presented, the provision for bad debt was immaterial. The Company also records an allowance for estimated credit losses on amounts due from monthly installment arrangements based on historical default rates. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded $ 17.7 million and $ 6.7 million, respectively, as an allowance on its installment arrangements, which is included in accounts receivable, net, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, with a corresponding reduction to deferred revenue. F-10 Inventories Inventories are accounted for using the weighted average cost method and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventories consist primarily of products for resale, including merchandise, culinary items and miscellaneous supplies. Obsolete or excess inventories are recorded at their estimated realizable value. Property and Equipment—Net Property and equipment are recorded at cost. The cost of ordinary or routine maintenance, repairs, spare parts and minor renewals is expensed as incurred. Development costs associated with new attractions and products are generally capitalized after necessary feasibility studies have been completed and final concept or contracts have been approved. The cost of assets is depreciated using the straight-line method based on the following estimated useful lives: Land improvements 10 - 40 years Buildings 5 - 40 years Rides, attractions and equipment 3 - 20 years Animals 1 - 50 years Certain costs related to animals exhibited in the theme parks are capitalized and amortized over their estimated lives ( 1 - 50 years ). All costs to care for animals are expensed as incurred. Construction in progress assets consist primarily of new rides, attractions and infrastructure improvements that have not yet been placed in service. These assets are stated at cost and are not depreciated. Once construction of the assets is completed and placed into service, assets are reclassified to the appropriate asset class based on their nature and depreciated in accordance with the useful lives above. Debt interest is capitalized on all active construction projects. Total interest capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $ 7.3 million, $ 6.3 million and $ 4.6 million, respectively. Computer System Development Costs The Company capitalizes computer system development costs that meet established criteria and, once placed in service, amortizes those costs to expense on a straight-line basis over five years . Total capitalized costs related to computer system development costs, net of accumulated amortization, were $ 1.5 million and $ 2.4 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are recorded in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Accumulated amortization was $ 12.4 million and $ 11.2 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Amortization expense of capitalized computer system development costs during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $ 1.4 million, $ 1.7 million and $ 2.2 million, respectively, and is recorded in depreciation and amortization in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Systems reengineering costs do not meet the proper criteria for capitalization and are expensed as incurred. Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but instead reviewed for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter, and as of an interim date should factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim test, with ongoing recoverability based on applicable reporting unit overall financial performance and consideration of significant events or changes in the overall business environment or macroeconomic conditions. Such events or changes in the overall business environment could include, but are not limited to, significant negative trends or unanticipated changes in the competitive or macroeconomic environment. In assessing goodwill for impairment, the Company may choose to initially evaluate qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The Company considers several factors, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance of the reporting unit, changes in management, strategy or customers, and relevant reporting unit specific events such as a change in the carrying amount of net assets, a more likely than not expectation of selling or disposing all, or a portion, of a reporting unit, and the testing of recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment is not conclusive, then a quantitative impairment analysis for goodwill is performed at the reporting unit level. The Company may also choose to perform this quantitative impairment analysis instead of the qualitative analysis. The quantitative impairment analysis compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, determined using the income and/or market approach, to its recorded amount. If the recorded amount exceeds the fair value, then a goodwill impairment charge is recorded for the difference up to the recorded amount of goodwill. The determination of fair value in the Company’s goodwill impairment analysis is based on an estimate of fair value for the relevant reporting unit utilizing known and estimated inputs at the evaluation date. Some of those inputs include, but are not limited to, estimates of future revenue and expense growth, estimated market multiples, expected capital expenditures, income tax rates and cost of invested cap ital. F-11 The Company’s other indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of certain trade names/trademarks and other intangible assets which, after considering legal, regulatory, contractual, and other competitive and economic factors, are determined to have indefinite lives and are valued using the relief from royalty method. Trade names/trademarks are combined by brand as a unit of accounting when testing for impairment as the brand represents the highest and best use of the asset and drives the Company’s marketing strategy and international license agreements. E stimates required in this valuation method include estimated future revenues impacted by the trade names/trademarks, royalty rates, and appropriate discount rates. Projections are based on management’s best estimates given recent financial performance, market trends, strategic plans, brand awareness, operating characteristics by park, and other available information. See Note 9–Goodwill and Trade Names/Trademarks, Net, for further details. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets All long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. An impairment loss may be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset, including disposition, are less than the carrying value of the asset. The measurement of the impairment loss to be recognized is based upon the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying amounts of the assets. Fair value is generally determined based upon a discounted cash flow analysis. In order to determine if an asset has been impaired, assets are grouped and tested at the lowest level for which identifiable independent cash flows are available (generally a theme park). See further discussion in Note 8–Property and Equipment, Net. Self-Insurance Reserves Reserves are recorded for the estimated amounts of guest and employee claims and expenses incurred each period that are not covered by insurance. Reserves are established for both identified claims and incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) claims. Such amounts are accrued for when claim amounts become probable and estimable. Reserves for identified claims are based upon the Company’s historical claims experience and third-party estimates of settlement costs. Reserves for IBNR claims are based upon the Company’s claims data history, actuarially determined loss development factors and qualitative considerations such as claims management activities. The Company maintains self-insurance reserves for healthcare, auto, general liability and workers’ compensation claims. Total claims reserves were $ 30.5 million at December 31, 2021, of which $ 1.7 million is recorded in accrued salaries, wages and benefits, $ 8.2 million is recorded in other accrued liabilities and the remaining long-term portion is recorded in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Total claims reserves were $ 31.1 million at December 31, 2020, of which $ 1.8 million is recorded in accrued salaries, wages and benefits, $ 7.5 million is recorded in other accrued liabilities and the remaining long-term portion is recorded in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. All reserves are periodically reviewed for changes in facts and circumstances and adjustments are made as necessary. Debt Issuance Costs Debt issuance costs are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the related debt and are included in long-term debt, net, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. See further discussion in Note 11–Long-Term Debt. Share Repurchase Program and Treasury Stock From time to time, the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) may authorize share repurchases of common stock. Shares repurchased under Board authorizations are currently held in treasury for general corporate purposes. The Company accounts for treasury stock on the trade date under the cost method. Treasury stock at December 31, 2021 and 2020 is recorded as a reduction to stockholders’ (deficit) equity. See further discussion of the Company’s share repurchase program in Note 20–Stockholders’ (Deficit) Equity. Revenue Recognition The Company records revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”), Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements within the scope of ASC 606, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contracts with customers; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies the performance obligations. ASC 606 also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts. Revenue is recorded net of sales-related taxes collected from guests and remitted or payable to government taxing authorities. F-12 Admissions Revenue Admissions revenue primarily consists of single-day tickets, annual or season passes or other multi-day or multi-park admission products. Admission products with similar characteristics are analyzed using a portfolio approach for each separate park as the Company expects that the effects on the consolidated financial statements of applying ASC 606 to the portfolio does not differ materially from applying the guidance to individual contracts within the portfolio. For single-day tickets, the Company recognizes revenue at a point in time, upon admission to the park. Annual passes, season passes or other multi-day or multi-park passes allow guests access to specific parks over a specified time period. For these pass and multi-use products, revenue is deferred and recognized over the terms of the admission product based on estimated redemption rates for similar products and is adjusted periodically. The Company estimates redemption rates using historical and forecasted attendance trends by park for similar products. Attendance trends factor in seasonality and are adjusted based on actual trends periodically. These estimated redemption rates impact the timing of when revenue is recognized on these products. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates based on actual attendance patterns. Revenue is recognized on a pro-rata basis based on the estimated allocated selling price of the admission product. For pass products purchased on an installment plan that have met their initial commitment period and have transitioned to a month to month basis, monthly charges are recognized as revenue as payments are received each month, with the exception of payments received during the temporary park closures in 2020 (see further discussion which follows). For multi-day admission products, revenue is allocated based on the number of visits included in the pass and recognized ratably based on each admission into the theme park. In 2020, as a result of the temporary park closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company upgraded some of its pass products and extended pass expiration dates for at least the equivalent period the related parks were closed. As a result, the Company adjusted its estimated redemption and recognition patterns on these products to reflect the fact that there was no attendance during the park closures and accordingly the Company did not recognize revenue from these admission products while the parks were temporarily closed in 2020. For passes under installment plans that had transitioned to a month to month basis, the Company temporarily paused monthly charges when the related parks reopened for the equivalent period the respective parks were closed. Accordingly, payments received during the closure period were recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue once the respective parks reopened in 2020, which may not have necessarily reflected attendance patterns for these guests. The Company has also entered into agreements with certain external theme park, zoo and other attraction operators to jointly market and sell single and multi-use admission products. These joint products allow admission to both a Company park(s) and an external park, zoo or other attraction. The agreements with the external partners specify the allocation of revenue to Company parks from any jointly sold products. Whether the Company or the external partner sells the product, the Company’s portion of revenue is deferred until the first time the product is redeemed at one of the Company’s parks and recognized over its related use in a manner consistent with the Company’s other admission products. Additionally, the Company barters theme park admission products and sponsorship opportunities for advertising, employee recognition awards, and various other services. The fair value of the products or services is recognized into admissions revenue and related expenses at the time of the exchange and approximates the estimated fair value of the goods or services provided or received, whichever is more readily determinable. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, amounts included within admissions revenue with an offset to either selling, general and administrative expenses or operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) related to bartered ticket transactions were $ 13.6 million, $ 4.7 million and $ 16.2 million, respectively. Food, Merchandise and Other Revenue Food, merchandise and other revenue primarily consists of food and beverage, merchandise, parking and other in-park products and also includes other miscellaneous revenue which is not significant in the periods presented. The Company recognizes revenue for food and beverage, merchandise and other in-park products when the related products or services are received by the guests. Certain admission products may also include bundled products at the time of purchase, such as food and beverage or merchandise items. The Company conducts an analysis of bundled products to identify separate distinct performance obligations that are material in the context of the contract. For those products that are determined to be distinct performance obligations and material in the context of the contract, the Company allocates a portion of the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation using each performance obligation’s standalone price. If the bundled product is related to a pass product and offered over time, revenue will be recognized over time accordingly. See further discussion in Note 4–Revenues. Advertising and Promotional Costs Advertising production costs are deferred and expensed the first time the advertisement is shown. Other advertising and media costs are expensed as incurred and, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, totaled approximately $ 81.4 million, $ 48.1 million and $ 138.3 million, respectively, and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). F-13 Equity-Based Compensation In accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation , the Company measures the cost of employee services rendered in exchange for equity-based compensation based upon the grant date fair market value. The cost is recognized over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period unless service or performance conditions require otherwise. The Company recognizes equity compensation expense for its performance-vesting restricted awards ratably over the related performance period if the performance condition is probable of being achieved. If the probability of vesting related to these awards changes in a subsequent period, all equity compensation expense related to those awards that would have been recorded over the requisite service period had the awards been considered probable at the new percentage from inception, is recorded as a cumulative catch-up at such subsequent date. The Company recognizes the impact of forfeitures as they occur. The Company grants time-vesting restricted shares and units, time-vesting deferred stock units, performance-vesting restricted shares and units, and stock options. The Company uses the closing stock price on the date of grant to value its time-vesting and performance-vesting restricted share awards. The Company uses the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model to value stock options at the date of grant. On occasion, the Company may modify the terms or conditions of an equity award for its employees. If an award is modified, the Company evaluates the type of modification in accordance with ASC 718 to determine the appropriate accounting. See further discussion in Note 19–Equity-Based Compensation. Restructuring Costs The Company accounts for exit or disposal of activities in accordance with ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations if the one-time benefit arrangements are not part of an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract. Nonretirement post-employment benefits that are part of an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract are accounted for in accordance with ASC 712, Compensation-Nonretirement Postemployment Benefits . The Company defines a business restructuring as an exit or disposal activity that includes but is not limited to a program which is planned and controlled by management and materially changes either the scope of a business or the manner in which that business is conducted. Business restructuring charges may include (i) one-time termination benefits related to employee separations, (ii) contract termination costs and (iii) other related costs associated with exit or disposal activities. If the one-time benefit arrangements are not part of an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract, a liability is recognized and measured at its fair value for one-time termination benefits once the plan of termination is communicated to affected employees and it meets all of the following criteria: (i) management commits to a plan of termination, (ii) the plan identifies the number of employees to be terminated and their job classifications or functions, locations and the expected completion date, (iii) the plan establishes the terms of the benefit arrangement and (iv) it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or the plan will be withdrawn. If the one-time benefit arrangements are part of an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract, a liability is recognized and measured at its fair value when the following conditions are met: (i) the obligation is attributable to services already rendered; (ii) rights to those benefits accumulate; (iii) payment of the benefits is probable; and (iv) amount can be reasonably estimated. If these four conditions are not met, a liability is recognized when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated in accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies . Contract termination costs include costs to terminate a contract or costs that will continue to be incurred under the contract without benefit to the Company. A liability is recognized and measured at its fair value when the Company either terminates the contract or ceases using the rights conveyed by the contract. See further discussion in Note 21–Severance and Other Separation Costs. Leases The Company leases land, warehouse and office space, and equipment, which are classified as either operating or finance leases. Under the provisions of ASC 842, Leases, lease liabilities and right of use assets are recognized at the lease commencement date on the basis of the present value of the future lease payments, with the right of use being adjusted by any prepaid or accrued rent, lease incentives, and initial direct costs. The lease term for each lease includes the noncancelable period plus any periods subject to an option for renewal when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. The subsequent measurement of a lease is dependent on whether the lease is classified as an operating or finance lease. Operating leases have a straight-line expense pattern that is recognized as either operating expenses or selling, general, and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Finance leases have a front-loaded expense recognition pattern that is comprised of amortization expense and interest expense that is included in depreciation and amortization and interest expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). The Company initially evaluates the classification of its leases as of the lease commencement date and reevaluates the classification of its leases upon the occurrence of certain lease remeasurement events and when there is a lease modification that is not accounted for as a separate contract. F-14 The present value of future lease payments is calculated using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Company’s incremental borrowing rate, which reflects the rate of interest it would pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments under similar terms. As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses incremental borrowing rates based on the information available at the lease commencement date , liability remeasurement date, or lease modification date in determining the present value of the lease payments. In calculating the incremental borrowing rates, the Company considered recent ratings from credit agencies, recent trading prices on the Company’s debt, and current lease demographic information. The Company applies the incremental borrowing rates at a portfolio level based on lease terms. In accordance with the short-term lease recognition exemption of ASC 842, the Company does not recognize on its balance sheet leases with an initial lease term of 12 months or less. Lease expense for these short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Some of the Company’s leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from one to ten years or more. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Company’s sole discretion and the inclusion of the renewal options in the lease term would only occur when the Company concludes it is reasonably certain of exercising the option(s). Certain leases also include options to purchase the leased property. Certain of the Company’s lease agreements include rental payments based on a percentage of sales over contractual levels and others include rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation. These variable lease payments are typically recognized when the underlying event occurs and are included in operating expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) in the same line item as the expense arising from fixed lease payments. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees, material restrictive covenants or material variable lease costs other than those described in Note 14–Leases related to the Company’s land lease. All long-lived assets, including right of use assets associated with leases, are reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. The measurement of an impairment loss to be recognized is based upon the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying amounts of the assets. Fair value is generally determined based upon a discounted cash flow analysis. See further discussion in Note 14–Leases. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Realization is dependent on generating sufficient future taxable income or the reversal of deferred tax liabilities during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Forecasted financial performance is not used as evidence until such time as the Company has cumulative pretax income for a rolling 36-month period. The Company evaluates its tax positions by determining if it is more likely than not a tax position is sustainable upon examination, based upon the technical merits of the position, before any of the benefit is recorded for financial statement purposes. The benefit is measured as the largest dollar amount of the position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon settlement. Previously recorded benefits that no longer meet the more likely than not threshold are charged to earnings in the period that the determination is made. Interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits are charged to the (benefit from) provision for income taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). See further discussion in Note 13–Income Taxes. Contingencies The Company accounts for contingencies in accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies . For loss contingencies, such as potential legal settlements, the Company records an estimated loss when payment is considered probable and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company, the Company evaluates the perceived merits of the legal proceedings as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein. If a loss is considered probable but the best estimate of the loss can only be identified within a range and no specific amount within that range is more likely, then the minimum of the range is accrued. Legal and related professional services costs to defend litigation are expensed as incurred. Insurance recoveries related to potential claims are recognized up to the amount of the recorded liability when coverage is confirmed and the estimated recoveries are probable of payment. These recoveries are not netted against the related liabilities for financial statement presentation. Additionally, for any potential gain contingencies, the Company does not recognize the gain until the period that all contingencies have been resolved and the amounts are realizable. See further discussion in Note 15–Commitments and Contingencies. F-15 Fair Value Measurements Fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement and is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. An entity is permitted to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each period. The Company has not elected to use the fair value option for any of its financial assets and financial liabilities that are not already recorded at fair value. Carrying values of financial instruments classified as current assets and current liabilities approximate fair value, due to their short-term nature. Fair Value Hierarchy —As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, fair value accounting standards establish a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity. Fair value is determined for assets and liabilities, based upon significant levels of observable or unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s market assumptions. This hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. These two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy: Level 1 —Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Level 2 —Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets. Level 3 —Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. Determination of Fair Value —If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed valuation techniques that use, where possible, current market-based or independently sourced market parameters, such as interest and currency rates. Assets or liabilities valued using such internally generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation. Thus, an item may be classified in Level 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that are readily observable. See further discussion in Note 16–Fair Value Measurements. Segment Reporting The Company maintains discrete financial information for each of its twelve theme parks, which is used by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”), as a basis for allocating resources and assessing performance. Each theme park has been identified as an operating segment and meets the criteria for aggregation due to similar economic characteristics. In addition, all of the theme parks provide similar products and services and share similar processes for delivering services. The theme parks have a high degree of similarity in the workforces and target similar consumer groups. Accordingly, based on these economic and operational similarities and the way the CODM monitors and makes decisions affecting the operations, the Company has concluded that its operating segments may be aggregated and that it has one reportable segment. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging , provides the disclosure requirements for derivatives and hedging activities with the intent to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of: (i) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (ii) how the entity accounts for derivative instruments and related hedged items, and (iii) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Further, qualitative disclosures are required that explain the Company’s objectives and strategies for using derivatives, as well as quantitative disclosures about the fair value of, and gains and losses on, derivative instruments, and disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative instruments. As required by ASC 815, the Company records all derivatives, if any, on the balance sheet at fair value as either assets or liabilities. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. For derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk, the changes in fair value of the derivative contract are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, and subsequently reclassified into interest expense in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. F-16 Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge. The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of its risk, even though hedge accounting does not apply or the Company elects not to apply hedge accounting. See further discussion in Note 12–Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. 3. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS The Company reviews new accounting pronouncements as they are issued or proposed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). Recently Implemented Accounting Standards During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company adopted the following Accounting Standards Updates (“ASUs”) which had no material impact on its consolidated financial statements or disclosures: • ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) , provides optional transition guidance to ease the potential accounting burden associated with transitioning away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), with optional expedients related to the application of GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform. The provisions of this ASU are effective upon issuance and can be applied prospectively through December 31, 2022. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements or disclosure. • ASU 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes , simplifies various aspects related to accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and clarifying certain aspects of the current guidance to promote consistency among reporting entities. ASU 2019-12 was effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2021. Most amendments within this ASU are required to be applied on a prospective basis, while certain amendments must be applied on a retrospective or modified retrospective basis. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements or disclosures. 4. REVENUES Deferred revenue primarily includes revenue associated with pass products, admission or in-park products or services with a future intended use date and contract liability balances related to licensing and international agreements collected in advance of the Company satisfying its performance obligations and is expected to be recognized in future periods. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, $ 14.5 million and $ 13.4 million, respectively, is included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets related to the long-term portion of deferred revenue, which primarily relates to the Company’s international agreement, as discussed in the following section. The following table reflects the Company’s deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2021 and 2020: 2021 2020 (In thousands) Deferred revenue, including long-term portion $ 169,333 $ 144,187 Less: Deferred revenue, long-term portion, included in other liabilities 14,540 13,428 Deferred revenue, short-term portion $ 154,793 $ 130,759 The majority of the deferred revenue, short term portion, balance outstanding as of January 1, 2021 was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021. International Agreements The Company previously received $ 10.0 million in deferred revenue recorded in other liabilities related to a nonrefundable payment received from a partner in connection with a project in the Middle East to provide certain services pertaining to the planning and design of SeaWorld Abu Dhabi, a marine life theme park on Yas Island (the “Middle East Project”), with funding received expected to offset internal expenses. The Company also receives additional funds from its partner related to agreed upon services and reimbursements of costs incurred by the Company on behalf of the Middle East Project, including approximately $ 4.5 million and $ 1.9 million of additional deferred revenue recorded in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Separately, the Company recognizes an asset for the costs incurred to fulfill the contract if the costs are specifically identifiable, enhance resources that will be used to satisfy performance obligations in the future and are expected to be recovered. As a result, approximately $ 9.6 million and $ 5.9 million of costs incurred related to the Middle East Project are recorded in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The related deferred revenue and expense will begin to be recognized when substantially all of the services have been performed. The Company continually monitors performance on the contract and will make adjustments, if necessary. Construction for the Middle East Project is on track and scheduled to be completed by the end of 2022 . F-17 In March 2017, the Company entered into a Park Exclusivity and Concept Design Agreement and a Center Concept and Preliminary Design Support Agreement (collectively, the “ZHG Agreements”) with an affiliate of Zhonghong Zhuoye Group Co., Ltd. (“ZHG Group”), to provide design, support and advisory services for various potential projects and grant exclusive rights in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau. In April 2019, the Company terminated the ZHG Agreements for non-payment of undisputed amounts owed. For the year ended December 31, 2019 , the Company recorded revenue related to the ZHG Agreements of approximately $ 1.7 million, which is included in food, merchandise and other revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). There were no amounts recorded as revenue related to the ZHG Agreements in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. See Note 17–Related-Party Transactions for further details. 5. EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE Earnings (loss) per share is computed as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Net Income Shares Per Share Amount Net Loss Shares Per Share Amount Net Income Shares Per Share Amount (In thousands, except per share amounts) Basic earnings (loss) per share $ 256,513 78,302 $ 3.28 $ ( 312,321 ) 78,194 $ ( 3.99 ) $ 89,476 80,309 $ 1.11 Effect of dilutive incentive-based awards 1,273 — 735 Diluted earnings (loss) per share $ 256,513 79,575 $ 3.22 $ ( 312,321 ) 78,194 $ ( 3.99 ) $ 89,476 81,044 $ 1.10 In accordance with ASC 260, Earnings Per Share , basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period (excluding treasury stock and unvested restricted stock awards). Unvested restricted stock awards are eligible to receive dividends, if any; however, dividend rights will be forfeited if the award does not vest. Accordingly, only vested shares of formerly restricted stock are included in the calculation of basic earnings (loss) per share. The weighted average number of repurchased shares during the period, if any, which are held as treasury stock, are excluded from shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is determined using the treasury stock method based on the dilutive effect of certain unvested restricted stock awards and certain shares of common stock that are issuable upon exercise of stock options. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2019, there were approximately 146,000 and 305,000 anti-dilutive shares of common stock excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2020, there were approximately 2,253,000 potentially dilutive shares of common stock excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share as their effect would have been anti-dilutive due to the Company’s net loss in the period. The Company’s outstanding performance-vesting restricted stock awards are considered contingently issuable shares and are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share until the performance measure criteria is met as of the end of the reporting period. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2019, approximately 352,000 and 247,000 performance-vesting restricted stock awards had met their performance criteria for their respective performance years as of the end of the reporting periods, respectively, and are therefore included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share. See further discussion in Note 19–Equity-Based Compensation. 6.

Trade Names/Trademarks, Net During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company performed a qualitative assessment for its indefinite-lived intangible assets and concluded that further evaluation was unnecessary. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company performed a quantitative assessment over certain trade names/trademarks with a combined balance of $ 111.9 million related to its SeaWorld brand. Based on its assessment, the Company determined the estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value and therefore no impairment had occurred. The Company performed a qualitative assessment for its remaining other indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of 2020 and concluded that further evaluation was unnecessary. Trade names/trademarks, net, at December 31, 2021 and 2020, consisted of the following: Weighted Average Amortization Period Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Value (In thousands) Trade names/trademarks - indefinite lives $ 157,000 $ — $ 157,000 Trade names/trademarks - finite lives 9.3 years 12,900 12,900 — Total trade names/trademarks, net $ 169,900 $ 12,900 $ 157,000 F-19 10.

The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provides for senior secured financing of up to $ 1,585.0 million, consisting of: (i) a first lien term loan facility (the “Term Loan Facility” and the loans thereunder, the “Term B Loans”), in an aggregate principal amount of $ 1,200.0 million which was fully drawn on the Closing Date. The Term Loan Facility will mature on August 25, 2028 ; and (ii) a first lien revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility” (and the loans thereunder, the “Revolving Loans”) and, together with the Term Loan Facility, the “Senior Secured Credit Facilities”), in an aggregate committed principal amount of $ 385.0 million, including both a letter of credit sub-facility and a swingline loan sub-facility. The Revolving Credit Facility will mature on August 25, 2026 . Also on August 25, 2021, SEA completed a private offering of $ 725.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.250 % senior notes due 2029 (the “Senior Notes”). See Senior Notes section which follows for more details. F-20 The Company used proceeds of the Term B Loans drawn on the Closing Date, together with the proceeds from the offering of the Senior Notes and cash on hand, to redeem SEA’s then outstanding 9.500 % second-priority senior secured notes due 2025 (the “Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes”), to refinance the SEA’s Existing Secured Credit Facilities, and to pay related expenses of the offering and refinancing (collectively, the “Refinancing Transactions”). As a result of the Refinancing Transactions, on August 25, 2021, SEA terminated its Existing Secured Credit Facilities and associated Term B-5 Loans and repaid all of its related outstanding obligations in respect of principal, interest and fees. Prior to the Refinancing Transactions, on July 14, 2021, SEA completed a redemption of $ 50.0 million of its Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes and separately on August 25, 2021, SEA completed another redemption of $ 50.0 million of its Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes (collectively, the “Partial Redemptions”). Pursuant to the Partial Redemptions, the aggregate principal amount of the Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes were redeemed at a price equal to 103.000 % of the respective principal amounts thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the respective redemption dates. In connection with the Refinancing Transactions, SEA also redeemed the remaining $ 400.0 million of its Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes (the “Full Redemption”). Pursuant to the Full Redemption, all of the aggregate principal amount of the Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes were redeemed at a price equal to the sum of (a) 100.000 % of the outstanding principal amount of the Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes redeemed pursuant to the Full Redemption plus (b) approximately $ 34.3 million related to the Applicable Premium (as defined in the respective indenture), which is included in loss on early extinguishment of debt and write-off of discounts and debt issuance costs for the year ended December 31, 2021, plus (c) accrued and unpaid interest thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date.

In addition to paying interest on the outstanding principal under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee equal to 0.50 % per annum to the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder. The Company will also be required to pay customary agency fees as well as letter of credit participation fees computed at a rate per annum equal to the applicable margin for LIBOR rate borrowings on the dollar equivalent of the daily stated amount of outstanding letters of credit, plus such letter of credit issuer’s customary documentary and processing fees and charges and a fronting fee computed at a rate equal to 0.125 % per annum on the daily stated amount of each letter of credit. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities require scheduled amortization payments on the term loans in quarterly amounts equal to 0.25 % of the original principal amount of the Term B Loans, payable quarterly, with the balance to be paid at maturity. F-21 In addition, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities require the Company to prepay outstanding term loan borrowings, subject to certain exceptions, with: - beginning with the fiscal year ending on December 31, 2022, 50% (which percentage will be reduced to 25% and 0% if the Company satisfies certain net first lien senior secured leverage ratios) of annual excess cash flow, as defined under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities; - 100% of the net cash proceeds of all non-ordinary course asset sales or other non-ordinary course dispositions of property, in each case subject to certain exceptions and reinvestment rights; - 100% of the net cash proceeds of any issuance or incurrence of debt, other than proceeds from debt permitted under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The Company may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities at any time, without prepayment premium or penalty, except in connection with a repricing event in respect of the term loans as described below, subject to customary “breakage” costs with respect to LIBOR rate loans. All borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including the absence of a default or event of default and the accuracy of representations and warranties in all material respects. All obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities are unconditionally guaranteed by the Company on a limited-recourse basis and each of SEA’s existing and future direct and indirect wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The obligations are secured by a pledge of SEA’s capital stock directly held by the Company and substantially all of SEA’s assets and those of each guarantor (other than the Company), including a pledge of the capital stock of all entities directly held by SEA or the guarantors, in each case subject to exceptions. Such security interests consist of a first-priority lien with respect to the collateral. As of December 31, 2021, SEA had approximately $ 20.5 million of outstanding letters of credit, leaving approximately $ 364.5 million available under the Revolving Credit Facility, which was not drawn upon as of December 31, 2021.

In addition, prior to August 15, 2024, SEA may redeem the Senior Notes at its option, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at a redemption price equal to 100 % of the principal amount of the Senior Notes redeemed, plus the “Applicable Premium” and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to the provisions set forth in the Indenture, at any time and from time to time on or prior to August 15, 2024, SEA may redeem in the aggregate up to 40 % of the original aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes (calculated after giving effect to any issuance of additional Senior Notes) in an aggregate amount equal to the net cash proceeds of one or more equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 105.250 %, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. Additionally, upon the occurrence of specified change of control events, each holder will have the right to require SEA to repurchase all or any part of such holder’s notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101 %. SEA’s obligations under the Senior Notes and related indenture are guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior secured basis, by the Guarantors, as defined, in accordance with the provisions of the indenture. First-Priority Senior Secured Notes On April 30, 2020, SEA closed on a private offering of $ 227.5 million aggregate principal amount of 8.750 % first-priority senior secured notes due 2025 (the “First-Priority Senior Secured Notes”). The First-Priority Senior Secured Notes mature on May 1, 2025 and have interest payment dates of May 1 and November 1 with the first interest payment paid on November 2, 2020 .

F-22 The First-Priority Senior Secured Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company, any subsidiary of the Company that directly or indirectly owns 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of SEA, and subject to certain exceptions, each of SEA’s subsidiaries that guarantees SEA’s existing senior secured credit facilities. Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes On August 5, 2020, SEA closed on a private offering of $ 500.0 million aggregate principal amount of Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes. Net of expenses related to the offering of the Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes and an amendment to its then existing senior secured credit agreement, the Company used a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes to repay the then outstanding borrowings of $ 311.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes were scheduled to mature on August 1, 2025 and had interest payment dates of February 1 and August 1 with the first interest payment paid on February 1, 2021 . See additional discussion in the preceding Refinancing Transactions section regarding the full redemption of the Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes in 2021. Restrictive Covenants The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and the indentures governing the Senior Notes and First-Priority Senior Secured Notes (collectively, the “Debt Agreements”), contain covenants that limit the ability of the Company, SEA and its restricted subsidiaries to, among other things: (i) incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares; (ii) make dividend payments on or make other distributions in respect of their capital stock or make other restricted payments; (iii) make certain investments; (iv) sell certain assets; (v) create or permit to exist dividend and/or payment restrictions affecting their restricted subsidiaries; (vi) create liens on assets; (vii) consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of their assets; and (viii) enter into certain transactions with their affiliates. These covenants are subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions and are based, in part on the Company’s ability to satisfy certain tests and engage in certain transactions based on Covenant Adjusted EBITDA. Covenant Adjusted EBITDA differs from Adjusted EBITDA due to certain adjustments permitted under the relevant agreements, including but not limited to estimated cost savings, recruiting and retention costs, public company compliance costs, litigation and arbitration costs and other costs and adjustments as permitted under the Debt Agreements. The Debt Agreements contain certain customary events of default, including relating to a change of control. If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the Debt Agreements will be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the Debt Agreements and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor in respect of the collateral securing the Debt Agreements. The Revolving Credit Facility requires that the Company, commencing as of the last day of the first full fiscal quarter after the Closing Date and subject to a testing threshold, comply on a quarterly basis with a maximum net first lien senior secured leverage ratio of 6.25 to 1.00 . The testing threshold will be satisfied (and therefore the covenant must be complied with at the end of such quarter) if the aggregate amount of funded loans and issued letters of credit (excluding up to $ 30.0 million of undrawn letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility and letters of credit that are cash collateralized) under the Revolving Credit Facility on such date exceeds an amount equal to 35 % of the then-outstanding commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Debt Agreements permit an unlimited capacity for restricted payments if the net total leverage ratio on a pro forma basis does not exceed 4.25 to 1.00 after giving effect to the payment of any such restricted payment. As of December 31, 2021, the net total leverage ratio as calculated under the Debt Agreements was 2.48 to 1.00. As of December 31, 2021, SEA was in compliance with all covenants contained in the documents governing the Debt Agreements. Long-term debt at December 31, 2021, is repayable as follows and does not include the impact of any future voluntary prepayments: Years Ending December 31, (In thousands) 2022 $ 12,000 2023 12,000 2024 12,000 2025 239,500 2026 12,000 Thereafter 1,862,000 Total $ 2,149,500 Interest Rate Swap Agreements The Company previously had five interest rate swap agreements (the “Interest Rate Swap Agreements”) which effectively fixed the interest rate on the LIBOR-indexed interest payments associated with $ 1.0 billion of SEA’s outstanding long-term debt. The Interest Rate Swap Agreements expired on May 14, 2020 . SEA designated the Interest Rate Swap Agreements above as qualifying cash flow hedge accounting relationships as further discussed in Note 12–Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities which follows. F-23 Cash paid for interest relating to the Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the First-Priority Senior Secured Notes, and the Interest Rate Swap Agreements, net of amounts capitalized, as applicable, was $ 116.1 million, $ 73.7 million and $ 80.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. See Note 10–Other Accrued Liabilities for accrued interest included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. 12. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Risk Management Objective of Using Derivatives The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources and duration of its debt funding and at times through the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the Company has previously entered into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. The Company’s derivative financial instruments, if any, are used to manage differences in the amount, timing and duration of the Company’s known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to the Company’s borrowings. The Company does not speculate using derivative instruments. In May 2020, the Company’s Interest Rate Swap Agreements expired. As such, the Company did no t have any derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk The Company’s objectives in using interest rate derivatives were to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily used interest rate swaps at times as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, such derivatives were used to hedge a portion of the variable cash flows associated with existing variable-rate debt. The Interest Rate Swap Agreements were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk. The changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and were subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affected earnings. Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to derivatives were reclassified to interest expense as interest payments were made on the Company’s variable-rate debt. Tabular Disclosure of the Effect of Derivative Instruments on the Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) The table below presents the pre-tax effect of the Company’s derivative financial instruments in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2020: Year Ended December 31, 2020 (In thousands) Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships: Loss recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) $ ( 370 ) Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to interest expense $ 2,501 Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) The following table reflects the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, for the year ended December 31, 2020: Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (In thousands): (Losses) Gains on Cash Flow Hedges Accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31, 2019 ( 1,559 ) Other comprehensive loss before reclassifications ( 271 ) Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense 1,830 Change in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax 1,559 Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at December 31, 2020 $ — F-24 13. INCOME TAXES For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the (benefit from) provision for income taxes is comprised of the following: 2021 2020 2019 Current income tax provision (In thousands) Federal $ ( 31 ) $ ( 136 ) $ ( 77 ) State 3,984 1,020 1,580 Foreign — 5 27 Total current income tax provision 3,953 889 1,530 Deferred income tax (benefit) provision: Federal 345 ( 19,718 ) 21,825 State ( 4,462 ) ( 11,696 ) 16,173 Total deferred income tax (benefit) provision ( 4,117 ) ( 31,414 ) 37,998 Total income tax (benefit) provision $ ( 164 ) $ ( 30,525 ) $ 39,528 The deferred income tax (benefit) provision represents the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Cash paid for income taxes totaled $ 5.9 million, $ 0.5 million and $ 1.4 million, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 are as follows: 2021 2020 Deferred income tax assets: (In thousands) Acquisition and debt related costs $ 4,292 $ 4,128 Net operating losses 199,656 272,943 Goodwill impairment 53,677 53,887 Self-insurance 7,220 7,410 Deferred revenue 2,878 5,707 Restricted stock 9,509 2,826 Tax credits 10,718 10,577 Legal settlements 855 645 Lease obligations 29,410 29,943 Interest limitation 562 463 Charitable contributions 3,243 3,977 Other 6,115 2,084 Total deferred income tax assets 328,135 394,590 Valuation allowance ( 4,775 ) ( 65,617 ) Net deferred tax assets 323,360 328,973 Deferred income tax liabilities: Property and equipment ( 194,739 ) ( 211,729 ) Amortization - Goodwill ( 55,827 ) ( 51,435 ) Amortization - Other intangibles ( 29,482 ) ( 26,080 ) Right of use assets ( 29,004 ) ( 29,631 ) Other ( 3,116 ) ( 3,023 ) Total deferred income tax liabilities ( 312,168 ) ( 321,898 ) Net deferred income tax assets $ 11,192 $ 7,075 The Company files federal, state and provincial income tax returns in various jurisdictions with varying statute of limitation expiration dates. Under the tax statute of limitations applicable to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations by the Internal Revenue Service for years before 2017. However, because the Company is carrying forward income tax attributes, such as net operating losses and tax credits from 2009 and subsequent years, these attributes can still be audited when utilized on returns filed in the future. The Company has determined that there are no positions currently taken that would rise to a level requiring an amount to be recorded or disclosed as an unrecognized tax benefit. If such positions do arise, it is the Company’s intent that any interest or penalty amount related to such positions will be recorded as a component of the income tax provision in the applicable period. F-25 The Company has federal tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $ 0.7 billion as of December 31, 2021 and state net operating loss carryforwards spread across various jurisdictions with a combined total of approximately $ 1.0 billion as of December 31, 2021. These net operating loss carryforwards, if not used to reduce taxable income in future periods, will begin to expire in 2030 and 2029 , for federal and state tax purposes, respectively. Realization of the deferred income tax assets, primarily arising from these net operating loss carryforwards and charitable contribution carryforwards, is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the carryforwards, which may include the reversal of deferred tax liability components. Through December 31, 2020, approximately $ 65.6 million of valuation allowances were established for some of the Company’s deferred tax assets, which, based on its analysis at the time, the Company believed did not meet the “more likely than not” criteria and would expire before being realized in future periods. These valuation allowance s consisted of the following as of December 31, 2020: approximately $ 39.5 million for federal net operating loss carryforwards, approximately $ 7.1 million for federal tax credits, approximately $ 4.0 million for federal and state charitable contributions and approximately $ 15.0 million, net of federal tax benefit, for state net operating losses. Based on the Company’s assessment of the realizability of its deferred tax assets during the year ended December 31, 2021, which included a review of current and forecasted financial performance, the Company believes that some of these deferred tax assets now meet the “more likely than not” criteria and will be realized in future periods before they expire. As a result, the Company reversed its valuation allowances by approximately $ 60.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has a remaining valuation allowance of approximately $ 4.8 million, net of federal tax benefit, on the deferred tax assets related to state net operating loss carryforwards. The Company’s valuation allowances, in part, rely on estimates and assumptions related to future financial performance. Given the macroeconomic environment related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the uncertainties regarding the related impact on financial performance, the Company’s valuation allowances may need to be adjusted in the future. The reconciliation between the statutory income tax rate and the Company’s effective income tax (benefit) provision rate for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, is as follows: 2021 2020 2019 Amount % Amount % Amount % (In thousands) Income tax at federal statutory rates $ 53,833 21.00 % $ ( 71,998 ) 21.00 % $ 27,091 21.00 % State taxes, net of federal benefit 12,070 4.71 ( 15,816 ) 4.61 7,645 5.93 Equity-based compensation ( 8,051 ) ( 3.14 ) ( 485 ) 0.14 ( 1,776 ) ( 1.38 ) Tax credits ( 137 ) ( 0.05 ) ( 304 ) 0.09 ( 795 ) ( 0.62 ) Impact of state rate changes ( 753 ) ( 0.29 ) ( 3,906 ) 1.14 3,770 2.92 Officer's compensation limitation 3,437 1.34 95 ( 0.03 ) 434 0.34 Valuation allowance - state ( 13,756 ) ( 5.37 ) 10,450 ( 3.05 ) 2,455 1.90 Valuation allowance - federal ( 47,061 ) ( 18.36 ) 49,951 ( 14.57 ) — — Other 254 0.10 1,488 ( 0.43 ) 704 0.55 Income tax (benefit) provision $ ( 164 ) ( 0.06 ) % $ ( 30,525 ) 8.90 % $ 39,528 30.64 % 14. LEASES The Company leases land, warehouse and office space, and equipment, which are classified as either operating or finance leases. The Company’s most significant lease is a long-term land lease with the City of San Diego covering approximately 190 acres, including approximately 17 acres of water in Mission Bay Park, California (the “Premises”). While there are no financial restrictions or covenants imposed by the Premises lease, there are certain operational restrictions in that the Premises must be used as a marine park facility and the Company may not operate another marine park facility within 560 miles of the City of San Diego. The lease term for the Premises ends in June 2048 and the annual rent under the lease is variable and calculated on the basis of a specified percentage of the Company’s gross income from the Premises (the “Percentage Rent”), or the minimum yearly rent (the “Minimum Rent”), whichever is greater. The required annual rent payments for the Premises is adjusted every three years to an amount equal to 80 % of the average accounting year rent actually paid for the three previous years, with the annual minimum rent calculated as $ 10.4 million through each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. F-26 The annual rent payments may vary from the base rent due to a shift of seasonal performance results. Rent payments related to the Premises for the years ended December 31, 20 2 1 , 20 20 and 201 9 were approximately $ 11.1 million (including approximately $ 1.6 million remitted in 2021 related to 2020 Percentage Rent) , $ 0.5 million and $ 10.5 million, respectively. The Company’s gross income from the Premises was significantly impacted during the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the temporary park closures, limited reopenings , modified operations and capacity restrictions resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related government restrictions in San Diego. Due to these factors , the Company deferred a payment of $ 8.3 million related to the Minimum Rent for the year ended December 31, 2020 (the “2020 Minimum Rent Payment”) . As such, approximately $ 10.8 million and $ 9.9 million is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet s as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 , respectively, primarily related to the 2020 Minimum Rent Payment , in addition to certain accrued fees as of December 31, 2021 and the timing of a Percentage Rent payment as of December 31, 2020. Operating lease liabilities and long-term operating lease liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 202 1 and 2020 and the lease maturities as of December 31, 202 1 are not adjusted for these deferred payments.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company has commenced construction of certain new theme park attractions and other projects under contracts with various third parties. As of December 31, 2021, excluding certain amounts related to the License Agreement with Sesame Workshop as described below, additional capital payments of approximately $ 181.6 million are necessary to complete these projects. The majority of these projects are expected to be completed in 2022 or 2023. License Agreements Pursuant to a license agreement (“License Agreement”) with Sesame Workshop, the Company pays a specified annual license fee, as well as a specified royalty based on revenues earned in connection with sales of licensed products, all food and beverage items utilizing the licensed elements and any events utilizing such elements if a separate fee is paid for such event. The Company’s principal commitments pursuant to the License Agreement include, among other items, the opening of a second stand-alone park (“Standalone Park”) no later than mid-2021 and minimum annual capital and marketing thresholds. After the opening of the second Standalone Park (counting the existing Sesame Place Standalone Park in Langhorne, Pennsylvania), the Company will have the option to build additional Standalone Parks in the defined territory within agreed upon timelines. The License Agreement has an initial term through December 31, 2031, with an automatic additional 15-year extension plus a five year option added to the term of the License Agreement from December 31st of the year of each new Standalone Park opening. As of December 31, 2021, the Company estimates F-28 the combined remaining liabilities and obligations for the License Agreement commitments could be up to approximately $ 30.0 million over the remaining term of the agreement. In October 2019, the Company announced that it will convert Aquatica San Diego into its second Sesame Place Standalone Park in the spring of 2021. While construction began in the fall of 2019, it was temporarily paused due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company opened its Aquatica San Diego park for the 2021 operating season and currently expects to open this park rebranded as its second Sesame Place Standalone Park in March 2022. ABI has granted the Company a perpetual, exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use the Busch Gardens trademark and certain related domain names in connection with the operation, marketing, promotion and advertising of certain of the Company’s theme parks, as well as in connection with the production, use, distribution and sale of merchandise sold in connection with such theme parks. Under the license, the Company is required to indemnify ABI against losses related to the use of the marks. Legal Proceedings Securities Class Action Lawsuit On June 14, 2018, a lawsuit captioned Highfields Capital I LP et al v. SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. et al, was filed in the United States District Court in the Southern District of California against the Company and certain of the Company’s former and present executive officers. The plaintiffs allege, among other things, that the Defendants made false and misleading statements in violation of the federal securities laws and Florida common law, regarding the impact of the film Blackfish on SeaWorld’s business. The complaint further alleges that such statements were made to induce Plaintiffs to purchase common stock of the Company at artificially-inflated prices and that Plaintiffs suffered investment losses as a result. The Plaintiffs have indicated to the Company they believe the damages are in the range of $ 30 million to $ 35 million before considering interest. In 2018, Defendants moved for partial dismissal of the complaint. In 2019, the Court granted Defendants’ motion and dismissed Plaintiffs’ Florida state law claims as well as federal securities law claims based on the Company’s second quarter 2013 earnings statements. The Court conducted settlement conferences which ended in impasse. The parties have completed discovery and each party has filed a summary judgment motion. The summary judgment motions as well as the Daubert motion filed by the Company are scheduled to be argued to the Court March 16, 2022. The Company believes that the lawsuit is without merit and intends to defend the lawsuit vigorously. While there can be no assurance regarding the ultimate outcome of this lawsuit , the Company believes that any potential loss would not be material. Other lawsuits In October 2018, the Company received a demand letter from attorneys representing certain former employees who claim that the terms of their respective separation agreements entitle them to certain favorable modifications made to certain performance-vesting restricted shares (the “Tranche 3 Shares”) issued under the Company’s 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Plan”). In November 2020, the Company filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware an action for declaratory judgment seeking a determination that the threatened claims of the former employees are time-barred and without merit. In response, the defendant former employees filed a motion to dismiss or in the alternative to stay and compel arbitration. The parties agreed to arbitrate whether the former employees’ claims are subject to arbitration. On October 21, 2021, the arbitrator determined that disputes related to the former employees’ claims for the vesting of the Tranche 3 Shares are governed by the forum selection clauses of the equity award amendments rather than the Company’s dispute resolution process. In terms of potential exposure, the value of the total shares at issue for these certain former employees depends largely upon the Company’s current share price, which fluctuates daily. Approximately 300,000 shares are at issue. The Company believes that the former employees’ claims are without merit and intends to defend vigorously its positions. While there can be no assurance regarding the ultimate outcome of this matter, the Company believes that any potential loss would not be material. Other Matters The Company is a party to various other claims and legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business. In addition, from time to time the Company is subject to audits, inspections and investigations by, or receives requests for information from, various federal and state regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”), the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“Cal-OSHA”), the Florida Fish & Wildlife Commission (“FWC”), the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”), the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Other than those matters discussed above, from time to time, various parties also bring other lawsuits against the Company. Matters where an unfavorable outcome to the Company is probable and which can be reasonably estimated are accrued. Such accruals, which are not material for any period presented, are based on information known about the matters, the Company’s estimate of the outcomes of such matters, and the Company’s experience in contesting, litigating and settling similar matters. Matters that are considered reasonably possible to result in a material loss are not accrued for, but an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss is disclosed, if such amount or range can be determined. At this time, management does not expect any such known claims, legal proceedings or regulatory matters to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. F-29 2020 Settled Matters In 2020, the Company received final court approval of a settlement for a previously disclosed stockholder class action lawsuit, captioned Baker v. SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc., et al . The settlement required the Company to pay $ 65.0 million for claims alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as the costs of administration and legal fees and expenses. The settlement does not include or constitute an admission, concession, or finding of any fault, liability, or wrongdoing by the Company or any defendant. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded $ 32.1 million of legal settlement charges, net of insurance recoveries, related to this case, in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). The full settlement amount was funded during the year ended December 31, 2020. In 2020, the Company received final court approval of a settlement for a previously disclosed putative derivative lawsuit captioned Kistenmacher v. Atchison, et al. The Company was a “Nominal Defendant” in the lawsuit. Pursuant to the settlement, the Company received $ 12.5 million of insurance proceeds from its insurers and adopted certain corporate governance modifications. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a legal settlement gain of $ 12.5 million related to insurance proceeds received in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). 16. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS Of the Company’s long-term obligations as of December 31, 2021, the Term B Loans are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and the First-Priority Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes are classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Of the Company’s long-term obligations as of December 31, 2020, the Term B-5 Loans are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and the First-Priority Senior Secured Notes and the Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes are classified in level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the Term B Loans and the Term B-5 Loans approximates their carrying value, excluding unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts, due to the variable nature of the underlying interest rates and the frequent intervals at which such interest rates are reset. The fair value of the First-Priority Senior Secured Notes, Senior Notes, and Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes was determined using quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments. See Note 11–Long-Term Debt for further details. The Company did no t have any assets measured on a recurring basis at fair value as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.

F-30 17. RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS ZHG Transaction As previously disclosed, Sun Wise (UK) Co., LTD., an affiliate to the ZHG Group (“Sun Wise”), previously held beneficial ownership of 19,452,063 shares (the “Pledged Shares”) of the Company’s common stock, which Sun Wise pledged in connection with certain loan obligations of Sun Wise. Sun Wise subsequently defaulted on such loan obligations and, as a result, certain of its lenders (together, the “Lenders”) foreclosed on the Pledged Shares. The Pledged Shares were transferred to a security agent for the Lenders (the “Security Agent”), on May 3, 2019. On May 27, 2019, the Security Agent entered into a share repurchase agreement with the Company pursuant to which the Security Agent agreed to sell and the Company agreed to purchase 5,615,874 of the Pledged Shares held by the Security Agent at a price per share equal to $ 26.71 (the “SEAS Repurchase”) for a total cost of approximately $ 150.0 million. The SEAS Repurchase closed on May 30, 2019 . See Note 20 – Stockholders’ (Deficit) Equity for further details. Also on May 27, 2019, the Security Agent entered into a stock purchase agreement with Hill Path Capital LP (“Hill Path”) and certain of its affiliates pursuant to which the Security Agent agreed to sell and certain affiliates of Hill Path agreed to purchase, in the aggregate, 13,214,000 of the Pledged Shares held by the Security Agent at a price per share equal to $ 26.71 (the “HP Purchase”). The purchase closed on May 30, 2019 , at which time, Hill Path’s ownership percentage increased to 34.6 %. ZHG Agreements As discussed in Note 4–Revenues, in March 2017, the Company entered into the ZHG Agreements. In April 2019, the Company terminated the ZHG Agreements for non-payment of undisputed amounts owed. See Note 4–Revenues for further details including amounts recorded as revenue related to the ZHG Agreements. Hill Path Capital LP Agreements On May 27, 2019, in connection with the HP Purchase, the Company concurrently entered into a stockholders agreement, a registration rights and the Amended and Restated Undertaking Agreement with Hill Path (collectively, the “HP Agreements”). Under the HP Agreements, the Company agreed to appoint up to three Hill Path director designees to its Board and Hill Path agreed to certain customary standstill obligations, restrictions regarding the manner of sale of shares, and equal treatment for any change in control transaction. In addition, Hill Path agreed that shares held in excess of 24.9 % generally would be voted consistent with the Board’s recommendations or consistent with the shares voted by the Company’s other stockholders. The Company also agreed to reimburse Hill Path for up to $ 250,000 of their expenses in connection with the HP Agreements. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company reimbursed Hill Path for $ 250,000 in expenses incurred. 18. RETIREMENT PLAN The Company sponsors a defined contribution plan, under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. During 2019, the plan was a qualified automatic contributions arrangement, which automatically enrolled employees, once eligible, unless they opted out. Effective January 1, 2020, the plan removed the automatic contributions arrangement. Through December 31, 2019, the Company made matching cash contributions subject to certain restrictions, structured as a 100 % match on the first 1 % contributed by the employee and a 50 % match on the next 5 % contributed by the employee. Effective January 1, 2020, the plan amended the matching cash contributions structure going forward to be a 50 % match on the first 4 % of eligible pay contributed by the employee. In April 2020, the Company matching contribution was temporarily suspended in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and has remained suspended through 2021. Employer matching contributions for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, totaled $ 1.3 million and $ 7.5 million, respectively, and is included in selling, general and administrative expenses and in operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). 19. EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION Equity compensation expense is included in operating expenses and in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) as follows: For the Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 (In thousands) Equity compensation expense included in operating expenses $ 9,578 $ 522 $ 4,076 Equity compensation expense included in selling, general and administrative expenses 30,144 6,945 7,030 Total equity compensation expense $ 39,722 $ 7,467 $ 11,106 F-31 Equity compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2021, includes the impact of certain prior year performance vesting restricted awards which were previously not considered probable of vesting. Equity compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2020, includes the reversal of expense related to certain performance vesting restricted awards which at the time were no longer considered probable of vesting and also includes the reversal of expense related to outstanding unvested equity awards previously held by the Company’s former chief executive officer which were forfeited in connection with his departure. See Previous Long-term Incentive Awards section which follows for further details. Total unrecognized equity compensation expense for all equity compensation awards probable of vesting as of December 31, 2021 was approximately $ 29.0 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years. The total fair value of shares which vested during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was approximately $ 13.6 million, $ 12.7 million and $ 9.7 million, respectively. The weighted average grant date fair value per share of time-vesting and performance-vesting restricted awards granted during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $ 52.12 , $ 15.85 and $ 26.55 per share, respectively. The activity related to the Company’s time-vesting and performance-vesting restricted awards during the year ended December 31, 2021 was as follows: Performance-Vesting Restricted Awards Time-Vesting Restricted Awards Bonus Performance Restricted Awards Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Awards Shares/Units Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value per Award Shares/Units Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value per Award Shares/Units Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value per Award Outstanding at December 31, 2020 1,692,579 $ 14.18 23,298 $ 26.16 1,467,636 $ 23.38 Granted 243,573 $ 53.14 132,251 $ 51.64 232,954 $ 51.33 Vested ( 858,090 ) $ 15.03 ( 22,569 ) $ 26.16 ( 7,747 ) $ 14.66 Forfeited ( 140,042 ) $ 24.73 ( 21,725 ) $ 50.07 ( 702,840 ) $ 20.75 Outstanding at December 31, 2021 938,020 $ 21.94 111,255 $ 51.78 990,003 $ 31.90 The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was approximately $ 9.5 million, $ 1.3 million and $ 2.4 million, respectively. The activity related to the Company’s stock option awards during the year ended December 31, 2021 was as follows: Options Weighted Average Exercise Price Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Life (in years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in thousands) Outstanding at December 31, 2020 679,988 $ 21.51 Granted 177,688 $ 51.52 Forfeited ( 76,036 ) $ 37.61 Expired ( 3,639 ) $ 20.01 Exercised ( 289,567 ) $ 20.40 Outstanding at December 31, 2021 488,434 $ 30.59 7.08 $ 16,739 Exercisable at December 31, 2021 227,462 $ 21.61 5.41 $ 9,838 The weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted during the year ended December 31, 2021 was $ 29.17 . Key weighted-average assumptions utilized in the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model for stock options granted during the year ended December 31, 2021 were: Risk-free interest rate 1.10 % Expected volatility 61.22 % Expected dividend yield 0.00 % Expected life (years) ( a ) 6.13 F-32 ( a ) The expected life was estimated using the simplified method, as the Company does not have sufficient historical exercise data due to the limited period of time its common stock has been publicly traded. Omnibus Incentive Plan The Company has reserved 15,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the Company’s Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Omnibus Incentive Plan”), of which approximately 7,830,000 are available for future issuance as of December 31, 2021. Bonus Performance Restricted Awards During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company granted approximately 132,000 performance-vesting restricted units (the “Bonus Performance Restricted Awards”) in accordance with its annual bonus plan for 2021 (the “2021 Bonus Plan”). The 2021 Bonus Plan provides for bonus awards payable 50 % in cash and 50 % in performance-vesting restricted units (the “Bonus Performance Restricted Units”) and is based upon the Company’s achievement of specified performance goals, as defined by the 2021 Bonus Plan, with respect to the year ended December 31, 2021 (the “Fiscal 2021”). The total number of units eligible to vest into shares of stock is based on the level of achievement of the targets for Fiscal 2021 which ranges from 0 % (if below threshold performance), to 125 % (if at maximum performance) with opportunities to earn above 125% when achievement is above the maximum performance for certain metrics. In accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation , equity compensation expense is recorded on shares probable of vesting. Based on the Company’s actual Fiscal 2021 results with respect to specific performance goals, a portion of the outstanding performance-vesting restricted awards related to the Fiscal 2021 performance goals were considered probable of vesting as of December 31, 2021; therefore, equity compensation expense has been recorded related to these awards. These awards are expected to vest in accordance with their terms, at which time any unearned units will forfeit. Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company did not have an annual bonus plan for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020; however, based on a discretionary review of performance in light of the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s business, the Compensation Committee determined to make discretionary equity awards to the Company’s bonus eligible employees during the year ended December 31, 2021. These awards were paid entirely in restricted stock units that vest 50 % each on the first and second anniversaries of the date of grant. The Company also had previously granted performance-vesting restricted units which were eligible to vest based on the Company’s actual results for the year ended December 31, 2019. A portion of these units vested in 2020, and the remaining portion vested in 2021 based on the employee’s continued employment on such vesting date and the remainder forfeited in accordance with their terms. 2021 Long-Term Incentive Awards During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company granted long-term incentive plan awards for 2021 (the “2021 Long-Term Incentive Grant”) which were comprised of approximately 157,000 nonqualified stock options (the “Long-Term Incentive Options”) and approximately 168,000 performance-vesting restricted units (the “Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Units”) (collectively, the “Long-Term Incentive Awards”). Long-Term Incentive Options The Long-Term Incentive Options vest over three years , with 20 % vesting on each of the first two anniversaries of the grant date and 60 % vesting on the third anniversary of the grant date, subject to continued employment through the applicable vesting date. Equity compensation expense for these options is recognized for each tranche over the vesting period using the straight-line method. Upon stock option exercises, authorized but unissued shares are issued by the Company. Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Units The Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Units are expected to vest following the end of the three-year performance period beginning on January 1, 2021 and ending on December 31, 2023 (the “Performance Period”) based upon the Company’s achievement of specified performance goals during the Performance Period. The total number of Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Units eligible to vest will be based on the level of achievement of the performance goals and ranges from 0 % (if below threshold performance) up to 100 % (for target or above performance). Upon achievement of at least the threshold performance goals, only 25% to 50% of the award for a given level of performance will vest, with the remaining 50% subject to a one-year performance test period. Performance for the test period must meet or exceed at least 95 % of the prior year’s performance before up to the remaining 50 % of the units can be earned. The Company recognizes equity compensation expense for its performance-vesting restricted awards ratably over the related performance period, if the performance condition is likely to be achieved. If the probability of vesting related to awards changes in a subsequent period, all equity compensation expense related to those awards that would have been recorded over the requisite service period had the current assumptions been used since the grant date is recorded as a cumulative catch-up at such subsequent date. Based F-33 on the Company’s likely future achievement of respective performance goals as of December 31, 2021, equity compensation expense was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2021 related to the Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Units. Other Long-Term Incentive Awards During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company also granted time-vesting restricted units to certain employees which generally vest over three years , with 20 % vesting on each of the first two anniversaries of the grant date and 60 % vesting on the third anniversary of the grant date , subject to continued employment through the applicable vesting date. Previous Long-Term Incentive Awards The Company also has outstanding time-vesting restricted awards (the “Long-Term Incentive Time Restricted Awards”), performance-vesting restricted awards (the “Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Awards”) and nonqualified stock options granted under previous long-term incentive plan grants. During the year ended December 31, 2021, a portion of the previously granted Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Awards related to completed performance periods vested, with the remainder forfeiting in accordance with their terms. The remaining outstanding Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Awards related to future performance periods are eligible to vest based upon the Company’s achievement of pre-established performance goals for the respective performance period, as defined. A portion of the outstanding Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Awards relate to performance restricted units (the “2019 LTIP Performance Awards”) which contain a four-year performance period consisting of the 2019-2022 calendar years (or, extended through the end of the 2023 calendar year, as applicable) and are eligible to vest based upon the Company’s achievement of specific performance goals for the performance period, as defined, with an opportunity to vest up to 50% of the award earlier if certain goals are achieved in any fiscal year during the performance period. The total number of 2019 LTIP Performance Awards eligible to vest will be based on the level of achievement of the performance goals and ranges from 0 % (if below threshold performance) up to 100 % (for target or above performance). Upon achievement of the performance goals, up to 50% of the award for a given level of performance will vest, with the remaining 50% subject to a one-year extended performance test period. The goal achieved must be met again or exceeded for the extended performance period before the remaining units are earned. Based on the Company’s results for fiscal year 2021, the Company expects to vest a portion of the 2019 LTIP Performance Awards in the first quarter of 2022. Other During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company granted equity awards to its non-employee members of its Board which will vest on the day before the Company’s next annual meeting. Each eligible Board member elected the form of their equity award as either deferred stock units (“DSUs”) or restricted stock units (“RSUs”). Each DSU granted in 2021 represents the right to receive one share of the Company’s common stock three months after the respective director leaves the Board. Upon vesting, each RSU will be converted into one share of the Company’s common stock. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company granted equity awards in the form of RSUs or DSUs which vested immediately to each eligible Board member in lieu of quarterly cash payments related to the director’s annual retainers. 20. STOCKHOLDERS’ (DEFICIT) EQUITY As of December 31, 2021, 95,541,992 shares of common stock were issued in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, which includes 19,953,042 shares of treasury stock held by the Company (see Share Repurchase Program discussion which follows), but excludes 50,862 unvested shares of common stock and 1,988,416 unvested restricted stock units held by certain participants in the Company’s equity compensation plans (see Note 19–Equity-Based Compensation). Share Repurchase Program The Board had previously authorized the repurchase of up to $ 250.0 million of the Company’s common stock (the “Share Repurchase Program”). Under the Share Repurchase Program, the Company is authorized to repurchase shares through open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans and under Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company repurchased 3,692,794 shares for an aggregate total of approximately $ 215.7 million leaving approximately $ 21.8 million available under the Share Repurchase Program as of December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2020, prior to the COVID-19 temporary park closures, the Company repurchased 469,785 shares for an aggregate total of approximately $ 12.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company repurchased 5,615,874 shares (see discussion relating to the SEAS Repurchase in Note 17–Related Party Transactions for further details). The Share Repurchase Program has no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued completely at any time. The number of shares to be purchased and the timing of purchases will be based on the Company’s trading windows and available liquidity, general business F-34 and market conditions, and other factors, including legal requirements, debt covenant restrictions and alternative investment opportunities. All shares repurchased pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program, the SEAS Repurchase and shares repurchased directly from selling stockholders concurrently with previous secondary offerings, are recorded as treasury stock at a total cost of $ 631.1 million and $ 415.3 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are reflected as a reduction to stockholders’ (deficit) equity in the accompanying consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ (deficit) equity. 21. SEVERANCE AND OTHER SEPARATION COSTS The Company is committed to continuous improvement and regularly evaluates operations to ensure it is properly organized for performance and efficiency. As a result, during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2019, the Company recorded approximately $ 1.5 million and $ 4.2 million, respectively, in pre-tax charges primarily consisting of severance and other termination benefits, which is included in severance and other separation costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). In September 2020, the Company committed to a plan of termination (the “2020 Restructuring Program”) primarily impacting some of the Company’s previously furloughed salaried, full-time and part-time employees. Substantially all of the impacted employees were furloughed as part of the Company’s efforts to reduce operating expenses and adjust cash flows in light of business circumstances associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the sudden and unforeseeable economic impacts of the pandemic on the Company’s business operations, that were not reasonably foreseeable at the time of the temporary furloughs, the Company transitioned certain park and corporate personnel from a furloughed status to a permanent layoff. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded approximately $ 2.7 million in pre-tax restructuring charges primarily related to severance and other termination benefits related to the 2020 Restructuring Program, which is included in severance and other separation costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).

(the “Parent”) was incorporated in Delaware on October 2, 2009. See further discussion in Note 1–Description of the Business and Note 17–Related-Party Transactions in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The Parent has no operations or significant assets or liabilities other than its investment in SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc. (“SEA”), which owns and operates twelve theme parks within the United States. Accordingly, the Parent is dependent upon distributions from SEA to fund its obligations. However, under the terms of SEA’s various debt agreements, SEA’s ability to pay dividends or lend to the Parent is restricted, except that SEA may pay specified amounts to the Parent to fund the payment of the Parent’s tax obligations. The COVID-19 pandemic materially impacted operations for SEA for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. See further discussion relating to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Note 1–Description of the Business in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION The accompanying condensed financial statements (the “parent company only financial statements”) include the accounts of the Parent and its investment in SEA accounted for in accordance with the equity method and do not present the financial statements of the Parent and its subsidiary on a consolidated basis. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted since this information is included with the SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “consolidated financial statements”). These parent company only financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements. 3. GUARANTEES SEA is the borrower under the senior secured credit facilities, (the “Senior Secured Credit Facilities”) under a credit agreement dated as of December 1, 2009 which was amended and restated on August 25, 2021 (the “Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”). On August 25, 2021, SEA completed a private offering of $ 725.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.250 % senior notes due 2029 (the “Senior Notes”). On April 30, 2020, SEA closed on a private offering of $ 227.5 million aggregate principal amount of 8.750 % first-priority senior secured notes due 2025 (the “First-Priority Senior Secured Notes”). On August 5, 2020, SEA closed on a private offering of $ 500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9.500 % second-priority senior secured notes due 2025 (the “Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes”), which were fully redeemed during the year ended December 31, 2021. Under the terms of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the obligations of SEA are fully, unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by Parent, any subsidiary of Parent that directly or indirectly owns 100 % of the issued and outstanding equity interest of SEA, and subject to certain exceptions, each of SEA’s existing and future material domestic wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the “Guarantors”). SEA’s obligations under the Senior Notes and related indenture are guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior secured basis, by the Guarantors, as defined, in accordance with the provisions of the indenture. The First-Priority Senior Secured Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent, any subsidiary of the Parent that directly or indirectly owns 100 % of the issued and outstanding equity interests of SEA, and subject to certain exceptions, each of SEA’s subsidiaries that guarantees SEA’s existing senior secured credit facilities. See Note 11–Long-Term Debt of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further details . 4.

F-39 5. STOCKHOLDERS’ DEFICIT Omnibus Incentive Plan The Parent has reserved 15,000,000 shares of common stock for future issuance under the Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Omnibus Incentive Plan”), of which approximately 7,830,000 are available for future issuance as of December 31, 2021. The Omnibus Incentive Plan is administered by the compensation committee of the Parent’s Board, and provides that the Parent may grant equity incentive awards to eligible employees, directors, consultants or advisors of the Parent or its subsidiary, SEA, in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other stock-based and performance compensation awards. If an award under the Omnibus Incentive Plan expires or is canceled, forfeited, or terminated, without issuance to the participant, the unissued shares may be granted again under the Omnibus Incentive Plan. See further discussion in Note 19–Equity-Based Compensation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, Parent transferred approximately $ 6.0 million and $ 2.6 million in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options to SEA as a capital contribution and increased its investment in SEA. Share Repurchase Program The Parent’s Board previously authorized the repurchase of up to $ 250.0 million of the Company’s common stock (the “Share Repurchase Program”). Under the Share Repurchase Program, the Parent is authorized to repurchase shares through open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans and under Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. The Share Repurchase Program has no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued completely at any time. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Parent repurchased 3,692,794 shares for an aggregate total of approximately $ 215.7 million leaving approximately $ 21.8 million available under the Share Repurchase Program as of December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2020, prior to the COVID-19 temporary park closures, the Parent repurchased 469,785 shares for an aggregate total of approximately $ 12.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Parent repurchased a total of 5,615,874 shares of common stock at a total cost of approximately $ 150.0 million. All shares repurchased pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program, along with shares repurchased directly from selling stockholders concurrently with previous secondary offerings, are recorded as treasury stock at a total cost of $ 631.1 million and $ 415.3 million as of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are reflected as a reduction to stockholders’ (deficit) equity in the accompanying condensed balance sheets.

Business Company Overview We are a leading theme park and entertainment company providing experiences that matter and inspiring guests to protect animals and the wild wonders of our world. We own or license a portfolio of recognized brands including SeaWorld, Busch Gardens, Aquatica, Discovery Cove, Sesame Place and Sea Rescue. Over our more than 60-year history, we have developed a diversified portfolio of 12 differentiated theme parks that are grouped in key markets across the United States. Many of our theme parks showcase our one-of-a-kind zoological collection and feature a diverse array of both thrill and family-friendly rides, educational presentations, shows and/or other attractions with broad demographic appeal which deliver memorable experiences and a strong value proposition for our guests. We generate revenue primarily from selling admission to our theme parks and from purchases of food, merchandise and other items, primarily within our theme parks. For more information concerning our results from operations, see the “ Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As one of the world’s foremost zoological organizations and a global leader in animal welfare, training, husbandry, veterinary care and marine animal rescue, we are committed to helping protect and preserve the oceans, environment and the natural world. For more information, see the “—Our Culture and Social Responsibility” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Recent Developments Impact of Global COVID-19 Pandemic In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, and in compliance with government restrictions, we temporarily closed all of our theme parks effective March 16, 2020. Beginning in June 2020, we began the phased reopening of some of our parks with enhanced health, safety and sanitizing measures, capacity limitations, modified/limited operations, reduced hours and/or reduced operating days. In particular, on June 6, our Aquatica water park in Texas reopened; on June 11, all five of our Florida parks reopened; on June 19, our SeaWorld park in Texas reopened; on July 24, our Sesame Place park in Pennsylvania reopened; on August 5, our Busch Gardens park in Virginia reopened and on August 28, our SeaWorld park in California reopened on a limited basis, following the State of California’s guidance for reopening zoos. In compliance with revised state government restrictions issued late in the fourth quarter in California, we once again closed our SeaWorld park in California effective December 7, 2020. Separately, we were unable to open our Aquatica water park in California and our Water Country USA water park in Virginia for the 2020 operating season. Additionally, during the third quarter, the state of Virginia had a state mandated capacity restriction of 1,000 guests at a time which significantly restricted attendance for our Busch Gardens park in that state. On October 29, 2020, the State of Virginia revised its theme park guidance and modified the methodology for calculating capacity at theme parks. As a result, capacity at this park increased from 1,000 guests to approximately 4,000 guests at a time. On February 1, 2021, in consultation with the State of Virginia, we increased capacity to approximately 6,000 guests at a time based on revisions to the methodology for calculating restricted capacity at theme parks. On January 15, 2021, while our SeaWorld San Diego park remained closed, we introduced a limited time drive-through only experience for guests at this park. Subsequently, based on updated state government guidance issued in January 2021, we have since reopened our SeaWorld park in California on February 6, 2021 on a limited basis, once again following the State of California’s guidance for reopening zoos. In 2021, w e have also begun year-round operations at our SeaWorld park in Texas and have begun to operate on select days at both our Busch Gardens park in Virginia and our Sesame Place park in Pennsylvania. These parks are now open primarily on the weekend and holidays during the winter season, weather permitting. We continue to monitor guidance from, and engage with, federal, state and local authorities and may adjust our plans accordingly. Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, we have taken proactive measures for the safety of our guests, employees and animals, to manage costs and expenditures, and to maximize liquidity in response to the temporary park closures and limited reopenings related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of these measures included, but were not limited to: (i) increased our revolving credit commitments on March 10th; (ii) issued $227.5 million in first-priority senior secured notes and $500.0 million in second-priority senior secured notes to raise additional capital and further enhance available liquidity; (iii) entered into amendments to our existing senior secured credit facilities to amend our financial covenants ; (iv) initially furloughed approximately 95% of our employees upon closing all of our parks; (v) obtained payroll tax credits and deferred certain social security payroll taxes under the CARES act; (vi) temporarily reduced executive officers’ base salary by 20% through November 2020; (vii) eliminated and/or deferred all non-essential operating expenses at all of our parks and corporate headquarters while the parks were closed and actively managing operating expenses; (viii) eliminated substantially all advertising and marketing spend while the parks were closed and strategically managing marketing spend as parks reopened; (ix) substantially reduced or deferred all capital expenditures starting in March 2020 (other than minimal essential capital expenditures) when the parks were closed and postponed the opening of rides that were still under construction and scheduled to open in 2020; (x) worked with certain vendors and other business partners to manage, defer, and/or abate certain costs and payments and; (xi) added additional levels of review and approval for payments and cash disbursements which remains in place. 3 Concurrent with the reopening of some of our parks , we began to prudently bring some employees back from furlough . Some of our employees remain on furlough while others have been transitioned from a furloughed status to a permanent layoff . The COVID-19 pandemic, resulting park closures and limited park reopenings have had, and are likely to continue to have, a material impact on our financial results. See further discussion in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Leadership Changes Effective April 4, 2020, Sergio D. Rivera resigned from his position of Chief Executive Officer and as a member of our Board. As a result, the Board appointed Marc G. Swanson, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, to serve as Interim Chief Executive Officer and Elizabeth C. Gulacsy, our Chief Accounting Officer, to serve as Interim Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer in addition to her role of Chief Accounting Officer. Also on April 4, 2020, the Board appointed Walter Bogumil to serve as the Company’s Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Rivera was not entitled to any severance benefits in connection with his departure and forfeited his outstanding equity awards. The Board increased its size from eight to ten directors and elected Timothy J. Hartnett and Kimberly K. Schaefer to serve as directors of the Company on December 9, 2020. Our Competitive Strengths • Brands That Consumers Know and Love. We believe our brands attract and appeal to guests from around the world. We use our brands, intellectual property and the work we do to care for animals to increase awareness of our theme parks, drive attendance to our theme parks and create “out-of-park” experiences for our guests as a way to connect with them before they visit our theme parks and to stay connected with them after their visit. Such experiences include various consumer product offerings, including toys, books, apparel, and technology accessories as well as our websites and advertisements. • Differentiated Theme Parks. We own and operate 12 theme parks which deliver high-quality educational experiences, entertainment offerings, aesthetic appeal, and shopping and dining experiences. Our portfolio includes theme parks ranked among the most highly attended in the industry, including three of the top 20 theme parks and four of the top 10 water parks in North America, as measured by attendance ( TEA/AECOM 2019 Report ). Our combined theme park portfolio has over 650 attractions that appeal to guests of all ages, including 88 animal habitats, 114 programs and 204 rides. In addition, we have over 350 restaurants, photo and specialty retail shops. Our theme parks appeal to the entire family and offer a broad range of experiences, ranging from educational animal encounters and presentations, to thrilling rides and exciting shows. In fact, we have won numerous awards and recognition. See further details in our theme park portfolio table located in the Our Theme Parks section which follows. • Diversified Business Portfolio. Our portfolio of theme parks is diversified in a number of important respects. Our theme parks are located in geographic clusters across the United States, which at times can help protect us from the impact of localized events. Many of our theme parks showcase a different mix of thrill-oriented and family friendly attractions including rides, educational presentations and/or shows. This varied portfolio of offerings attracts guests from a broad range of demographics and geographies. Our portfolio of theme parks appeal to both regional and destination guests, which provide us with a diversified attendance base. • One of the World’s Largest Zoological Collections. We provide care for what we believe is one of the world’s largest zoological collections. We believe we are attractively positioned in the industry due to our highly unique zoological collection and ability to present our animals in a differentiated, interactive and educational manner. Through opportunities to explore and interact with these amazing animals in our parks, each year we educate millions of guests with the goal of inspiring them to care and protect animals and their habitats in the wild. Our commitment to these animals includes applying world-class standards of care while striving to provide habitats that promote their health. We also lead, partner with and/or sponsor research efforts that have provided and will continue to provide essential information and tools to help protect and sustain species in their natural habitats around the world. See the “— Conservation & Community Relations ” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. • Strong Competitive Position. Our competitive position is enhanced by the combination of our powerful brands, extensive zoological collection and expertise and attractive in-park assets located on valuable real estate. Our zoological collection and expertise, which have evolved over our six decades of caring for animals, would be extremely difficult and expensive to replicate. We have made extensive investments in new attractions and infrastructure and we believe that our theme parks are well capitalized (see the “— Capital Improvements” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of our new rides and attractions). We believe that the limited supply of real estate suitable for theme park development coupled with high initial capital investment, long development lead-times and zoning and other land use restrictions constrain the number of large theme parks that can be constructed. 4 • Proven and Experienced Management Team and Employees with Specialized Animal Expertise. Our senior management team, currently led by Marc Swanson , Interim Chief Executive Officer, have an average tenure of approximately 1 6 years in relevant industries. The management team is comprised of highly skilled and dedicated professionals with wide ranging experience in theme park operations, zoological operations, product and business development, hospitality, finance and accounting. Additionally, our animal care team is among the most experienced and qualified in the world, making us a global leader in animal welfare, husbandry, enrichment , and veterinary care. • Proximity of Complementary Theme Parks. Our theme parks are grouped in key locations near large population centers and/or tourism destinations across the United States, which allows us to realize revenue and operating expense efficiencies. Having complementary theme parks located within close proximity to each other also enables us to cross market and offer bundled ticket and vacation packages. In addition, closely located theme parks provide operating efficiencies including sales, marketing, procurement and administrative synergies as overhead expenses are shared among the theme parks within each region. • Significant Cash Flow Generation. We believe that our disciplined approach to capital expenditures, cost management and working capital management historically has enabled us to generate significant annual operating cash flow, even in years of declining performance. In addition, typically five of our 12 theme parks are open year-round, which helps reduce seasonal cash flow volatility. Due to the temporary park closures and limited reopenings as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our cash flow in 2020 was materially impacted. We have taken significant actions to carefully manage our cash flow, reduce our costs and strengthen our liquidity as we navigate through this environment. For more details, refer to the “— Impact of Global COVID-19 Pandemic ” section. • Care for Our Community and the Natural World. We are committed to the communities in which our theme parks are located and focus our philanthropic efforts in three areas: animal preservation and stewardship; youth development and education; and community initiatives that address environmental sustainability. Our theme parks inspire and educate children and guests of all ages through experiences that are educational, fun and meaningful. Additionally, our Sesame Place park was the first theme park in the world to have achieved the designation of Certified Autism Center from the International Board of Credentialing and Continuing Education Standards (the “IBCCES”). In 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we provided complimentary distance learning resources for students, teachers and parents to use as schools shifted to virtual classrooms. These resources included standards-aligned classroom activities, teacher’s guides, videos, and animal information books. By providing these distance learning resources, we were able to help families explore, discover, and stay connected virtually in a fun and inspiring environment even while our parks were temporarily closed. We also partner with charities across the country whose values and missions are aligned with our own by providing financial support, in-kind resources, strategic guidance, and/or hands-on volunteer work. For example, we are one of the primary supporters and a corporate member of the SeaWorld & Busch Gardens Conservation Fund, a non-profit conservation foundation, which makes grants to wildlife research and conservation projects that protect wildlife and wild places worldwide. In addition, we operate one of the world’s most respected rescue programs for ill and injured marine animals, in collaboration with federal, state and local governments, and other members of accredited stranding networks, among others, with the goal of rehabilitating and returning them to the wild. For more than five decades, our animal experts have helped more than 38,000 ill, injured, orphaned and abandoned wild animals. We are committed to animal rescue, conservation research and education and invest millions annually in these efforts. Our Theme Parks Our legacy started in 1959 with the opening of our first Busch Gardens theme park in Tampa, Florida. Since then, we have grown our portfolio of strong brands and strategically expanded across five states on approximately 2,000 acres of owned land and 190 acres of leased property in San Diego. Our theme parks offer guests a variety of exhilarating experiences, from animal encounters that invite exploration and appreciation of the natural world, to both thrilling and family-friendly rides, educational presentations and spectacular shows. Our theme parks are consistently recognized among the top theme parks in the world and rank among the most highly attended in the industry. We generally locate our theme parks in geographic clusters, which we believe improves our ability to serve guests by providing them with a varied, comprehensive vacation experience and valuable multi-park pricing packages, as well as improving our operating efficiency through shared overhead costs. Our portfolio of branded theme parks includes the following names (see the theme park portfolio table which follows for more details on each of these parks and a summary of our recent awards and recognitions): 5 • SeaWorld. SeaWorld is widely recognized as the leading marine-life theme park brand in the world. Our SeaWorld theme parks rank among the most highly attended theme parks in the industry and offer up-close interactive experiences, educational presentations, special dining experiences, thrilling attractions and a variety of educational and entertainment offerings that immerse guests in the marine-life theme. We also offer our guests numerous animal encounters, including the opportunity to work with trainers and feed marine animals, as well as themed thrill and family-friendly rides and entertainment that creatively incorporate our one-of-a-kind zoological collection. We currently own and operate the following SeaWorld-branded theme parks: • SeaWorld San Diego is the original SeaWorld theme park and was founded in 1964 by four graduates from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). SeaWorld San Diego spans 190 acres of waterfront property on Mission Bay in San Diego, California, is open year-round and is one of the most visited paid attractions in San Diego.

( i ) The total number of animal habitats, rides, shows, presentations, events, distinctive experiences and play areas in our theme park portfolio varies seasonally. Capital Improvements We make annual targeted investments to support our existing theme park facilities and attractions, as well as enable the development of new theme park attractions and infrastructure. Maintaining and improving our theme parks, as well as opening new attractions, is critical to remain competitive, grow revenue and increase our guests’ length of stay. We previously announced a strong lineup of attractions which were scheduled to open in 2020 including 5 of the 10 most anticipated roller coasters of 2020 ( USA Today, 2020 ). In order to manage costs and expenditures and to maximize liquidity in response to the temporary park closures and limited reopenings related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we substantially reduced or deferred all capital expenditures starting in March 2020 (other than minimal essential capital expenditures) when the parks were closed and postponed the opening of certain rides that were still under construction and scheduled to open in 2020. We were able to open certain new attractions in 2020 prior to the park closures including our award-winning Texas Stingray coaster at SeaWorld San Antonio . We are currently assessing the opening timelines for our new rides and attractions in light of capacity restrictions in place and may adjust our plans accordingly. We expect to open the following new rides and attractions in our parks: • Ice Breaker (SeaWorld Orlando): The first quadruple swing launch coaster in North America, featuring four airtime filled launches, both backwards and forwards, culminating in a reverse launch up a 93-foot vertical spike leading to the steepest beyond vertical drop in Florida. • Emperor (SeaWorld San Diego): The tallest, fastest, longest and first floorless dive coaster on the West Coast. After climbing more than 150 feet, the coaster car will dangle at a 45-degree angle before plunging into a 143-foot vertical drop that will accelerate riders to more than 60 miles per hour. • Iron Gwazi (Busch Gardens Tampa Bay): The tallest hybrid coaster in North America and the world’s fastest and steepest hybrid coaster, with the world’s tallest drop. Riders will climb more than 200 feet before plunging into a beyond vertical drop, reaching speeds of 76 miles per hour, and experiencing a dozen airtime moments. • Pantheon (Busch Gardens Williamsburg): The world’s fastest multi-launch coaster, will accelerate riders to a speed of 73 miles per hour and will include a 95-degree drop, four launches, two inversions, 15 air-time moments and a height of 180 feet. • Riptide Race (Aquatica Orlando): The first dueling pipeline slide in the state of Florida that will send riders racing through nearly 650 feet of slide all while navigating tight turns and accelerations alongside their opponents. 9 • Aquazoid Amped (Water Country USA): The first of its kind in Virginia, this new water slide experience will take guests in rafts through 59 fully enclosed color changing rings with dynamic sound spread over 219 feet of slide, providing a new thrill each time you ride . • Big Bird’s Tour Bus (Sesame Place): The whole family will enjoy a ride on this oversized, red double-decker bus with Big Bird and some of his furry friends. The bus goes around and around with a Sesame Street-inspired cityscape as the backdrop. Ride Conservation Partnerships We are pleased to announce partnerships with the following conservation organizations in conjunction with our new and planned rides, including: the Alaska SeaLife Center on our new Ice Breaker ride which will highlight animal rescue and climate change in the Arctic region; Penguins International on our new Emperor ride which will focus on penguin awareness and conservation; the Harte Research Center at Texas A&M on our new Texas Stingray ride which focuses on habitat protection in the Gulf of Mexico; and the Wilderness Foundation Africa on our new Iron Gwazi ride which will highlight the plight of endangered African wildlife. Safety, Maintenance and Inspection Safety is of utmost importance to us. Maintenance at our theme parks is a key component of safety and guest service and includes two areas of focus: (i) facilities and infrastructure and (ii) rides and attractions. Facilities and infrastructure maintenance consists of all functions associated with upkeep, repair, preventative maintenance, code compliance and improvement of theme park infrastructure. This area is staffed with a combination of external contractors/suppliers and our employees. Rides and attractions maintenance represents all functions dedicated to the inspection, upkeep, repair and testing of guest experiences, particularly rides. Rides and attractions maintenance is also staffed with a combination of external suppliers, inspectors, and our employees, who work to assure that ride experiences are operating within, and that maintenance is conducted according to, the manufacturer’s criteria, internal standards, industry best practice and standards (such as ASTM International, formerly known as the American Society for Testing and Materials), state or jurisdictional requirements, as well as the ride designer or manufacturer’s specifications. All ride maintenance personnel are trained to perform their duties according to internal training processes, in addition to recognized industry certification programs for maintenance leadership. Every ride at our theme parks is inspected regularly, according to daily, weekly, monthly, and annual schedules, by both park maintenance experts and external consultants. Additionally, all rides are inspected daily by maintenance personnel before use by guests to ensure proper and safe operation. A networked enterprise software system is used to plan and track various maintenance activities, in order to schedule and request work, track completion progress and manage costs of parts and materials. In addition to our day-to-day maintenance and inspection practices for the existing rides in our parks, before new rides are introduced to our guests, an extensive review of the ride, from design through installation, is conducted by the ride manufacturer, internal technical and operational experts, local authorities, as well as competent third party inspectors and engineers. Additionally, all new rides are analyzed according to a standardized, internal evaluation and acceptance process, which reviews, among other things, that the new ride operates safely and as intended, that the associated site and facility requirements for the ride operation are met, that the appropriate training of our employees is conducted, and that operational and maintenance procedures are documented. Our Culture and Social Responsibility As a purpose-driven company, our culture is built on our mission to provide experiences that matter for our guests and, in many of our parks, inspiring our guests to protect animals and the wild wonders of our world. Our management team and our employees, often referred to as ambassadors, are committed to social responsibility and strive to connect people to nature and animals and to do so in a socially responsible manner. We create an environment in our theme parks, where each guest can explore a diverse range of experiences meant to inspire and motivate them to join us in protecting animals and our planet. Our purpose and focus on creating experiences that matter for our guests are integral to our organization and the cornerstone of our success. Animal Care and Rescue We provide care for one of the largest zoological collections in the world. Our commitment to these animals includes applying world-class standards of care, while striving to provide habitats that promote the health of the animals. During our temporary park closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic, essential personnel, including our animal care experts, continued to provide for the health, safety, and nutritional needs of all of the animals in our care. Our animal care team is among the most experienced and qualified in the world, making SeaWorld a global leader in animal welfare, husbandry, enrichment, and veterinary care. 10 The zoological programs of all three SeaWorld parks, Discovery Cove and Busch Gardens Tampa Bay are validated by several professional zoological assessing organizations. Our parks are accredited members of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (“AZA”), one of the foremost professional zoological organizations in the world. In addition, our three SeaWorld parks and Discovery Cove are accredited by the Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums (“AMMPA”), an association specifically focused on the care of marine mammals. SeaWorld’s facilities have also received accreditation from the International Marine Animal Trainers’ Association (“IMATA”), whose Animal Trainer Development Program was developed to recognize those facilities that have exceptional systems for training animal care givers in the science and art of animal training, while utilizing positive reinforcement. And lastly, our parks are Certified Humane by Humane Conservation, an animal welfare certification standard developed by the independent third - party organization American Humane. We take a comprehensive approach to ensuring the health and welfare of the animals in our care that focuses on physical, behavioral and population health. Our animal care team includes board-certified veterinarians, technicians, and animal care experts, and we have onsite animal hospitals at each SeaWorld park and a guest-facing, state-of-the-art Animal Care Center at our Busch Gardens park in Tampa, Florida. We have also been at the forefront of advancing understanding and best practice-related behavioral health in animals. We are committed to caring for each individual animal, and to being responsible stewards of our animal populations, including ensuring that we maintain the genetic diversity needed for healthy and self-sustaining populations. We have invested significantly in developing leading-edge reproductive health expertise, technologies, and capabilities. Our focus on population health is also driven by our goal of helping to support, and our participation in, Species Survival Plans, which are ultimately aimed at preserving species in the wild. We apply high quality and comprehensive animal care standards, and actively work to advance knowledge and improve standards. We do this by contributing to research and sharing our insights with other zoological organizations around the world. For example, our continued work to define the clinically normal, healthy ranges for key measures in marine animals in our parks has helped to establish and refine the standards used by many veterinarians to assess both wild and managed marine species. This ongoing research also includes defining the basic biology and physiology of animals in our population. The combined results of these continued research efforts have provided and will continue to provide essential information and tools to help formulate plans to protect species in their natural habitats. We are also a leader in animal rescue. During the time we closed our parks in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our animal rescue and rehabilitation operations continued to operate to help wildlife in need. Over the last five decades, through December 31, 2020, we have helped more than 38,000 ill, injured, orphaned or abandoned wild animals in need of our expert care. Working in partnership with state, local and federal agencies, our rescue teams are on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year, including during our temporary park closures. Our commitment to animals also extends beyond our theme parks and throughout the world. We actively participate in species conservation and rescue efforts as discussed in the “— Conservation & Community Relations ” section which follows. Conservation and Community Relations Our purpose is to inspire people to protect animals and the wild wonders of the world, and a critical way we deliver on this is by providing our guests opportunities to explore and interact with the animals in our parks. Through our up-close animal encounters, educational exhibits, “Inside Look” events, educational presentations, and innovative entertainment, we strive to inspire each guest to take action to care for and conserve the natural world. Some of the animals in our care serve as ambassadors for their species through numerous national media and public appearances that educate the public and raise awareness for issues facing wildlife and wild places. We also partner with and support leading research, education and conservation organizations that help protect species of animals at risk in the wild, as well as the habitats that are home to many vulnerable species. We support conservation organizations such as the Killer Whale Research and Conservation Program, in partnership with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, to study and protect endangered killer whales in the wild, with a particular focus on the Southern Resident killer whale population found off the coast of Washington. Another example is a partnership with marine wildlife artist and conservationist Guy Harvey focused on ocean health and the plight of sharks in the wild. We also continue to support the Hubbs-SeaWorld Research Institute, which was started over 55 years ago by one of SeaWorld’s founders and remains a world-renowned scientific research organization committed to conserving and renewing marine life to ensure a healthier planet. 11 Alongside our conservation work, we are committed to giving back to the communities in which our theme parks are located. We focus our philanthropic efforts in three areas: animal preservation and stewardship; youth development and education; and community initiatives that address environmental sustainability. We partner with charities across the country whose values and missions are aligned with our own by providing financial support, in-kind resources, strategic guidance and/or hands-on volunteer work. Additionally, our ambassadors are actively involved in volunteer activities, such as beach and river cleanup efforts, fun run charity fundraisers, local food bank distributions and more. We also provide complimentary tickets and discounts to educators as well as active and former military and their families. Sustainable Operations Environmental conservation is implicit in our purpose. To thrive, animals need vibrant ecosystems and healthy habitats. We understand the adverse effects of human behavior and climate change on ecosystems and the animals who call them home; therefore, we are constantly working to minimize the footprint of our operations. As a part of our commitment to conservation, we have invested in numerous projects to reduce our energy and water use and the amount of waste we generate. For example, in 2019, the first full year of the elevated solar panel project at Aquatica San Diego, the panels generated nearly 100% of the park’s annual energy use. We believe our parks have some of the most advanced and efficient water purification systems in the world, which provide the optimum environment for our marine life. We leverage this knowledge to reclaim and recycle wastewater for reuse, thereby decreasing our consumption of fresh water. We have also implemented a range of other water conservation efforts across our parks, including a natural biofiltration system in 2019 at SeaWorld San Antonio, which is the first of its kind in a zoological setting. Many of our water conservation efforts incorporate lessons from our facilities in San Diego and San Antonio, which, driven in part by drought conditions, have found innovative opportunities to harvest rainwater, reuse water for cooling buildings, and adapt landscaping to require less water. We continually look for new ways to reduce water use in our parks and to support water conservation projects elsewhere. We see the impacts of marine debris and litter along shorelines and in coastal waters, estuaries, and oceans – a visible reminder of the need to reduce waste. We have implemented programs to generate less waste in our parks and to increase our recycling efforts. For example, in 2019, we replaced polystyrene foam dinnerware products with products made from 100% recycled materials at all of our parks. We also have removed all single use plastic drinking straws and shopping bags, have an extensive recycling infrastructure in place in all our parks and actively encourage our guests to recycle. Several of our parks have been externally recognized for their recycling programs. In 2018, for example, SeaWorld San Diego was selected by the City of San Diego’s Environmental Services Department as a “Recycler of the Year” – the 20 th time the park has received this award. We raise awareness with our employees and guests about the need for all of us to do our part to address this global challenge. Responsible Sourcing Corporate responsibility extends to how we source the goods and services needed to operate our parks and to serve our guests. We have established a Responsible Food Sourcing Policy, which outlines our commitment to partner with food suppliers that deliver products that meet or exceed sustainable, healthy and humane food standards. For example, our parks have converted to 100% cage-free eggs. We have also made a variety of commitments related to the sourcing of particular products. We have also set a goal of purchasing from suppliers that have announced a commitment and published targets to convert to group-housed humane farming. In response to growing guest demand, we have also taken steps to expand the number of plant-based food offerings on our menus across our parks. As part of these efforts, in 2019, we added a sustainable, plant-based burger to our menus at all of our parks. We have also taken additional steps, where possible, to identify and partner with brands and products in our parks which share our commitment to giving back to communities, animals, and / or our broader environment. Human Capital Management We have a diverse and mission-driven team of employee Ambassadors. Our team makes it possible each day to provide our guests with experiences that matter and to inspire them to protect animals and the wild wonders of our world. As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 2,300 full-time employees and approximately 8,200 part-time and seasonal employees. During our peak operating season in 2020, we employed additional part-time and seasonal employees, including high school and college students. Due to the temporary park closures and limited reopenings related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of employees and the mix of employees in 2020 was impacted as parks are operating with limited capacity and limited operating days and/or hours. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Our focus on recruiting and developing diverse talent has resulted in a management team that is approximately 50% female and 40% of a minority ethnicity. Similarly, our overall workforce is 53% women and 50% of a minority ethnicity. We don’t simply view diversity as a target, but rather a continual commitment to focus on creating the best and most inclusive workplace possible by recognizing and celebrating our unique backgrounds. 12 We strive to provide our Ambassadors with a competitive compensation package using market data including comprehensive benefits. We provide market-competitive benefits including health, dental, vision, disability, life insurance, retirement, paid time-off, complimentary tickets and various other benefits. In response to the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic and for the safety of our Ambassadors, we implemented new procedures which included remote work places when possible, social distancing, daily temperature checks, COVID-19 specific training and contact tracing to help protect our employees from the spread of the virus. Safety is not just important as it relates to the COVID-19 pandemic. We provide training and require certifications for certain positions. We routinely review all procedures and safety requirements to promote a safe working environment for our Ambassadors, guests and animals. We believe that working for our Company is more than a job – it is a commitment to the protection of animals and the wild wonders of our world, while also providing a fun and meaningful experience for our guests that will be remembered long after they leave our parks. We create memories that matter. Our human capital programs, policies, and initiatives will continue to reinforce this belief in the years ahead. Our Products and Services Admission Tickets We generate most of our revenue from selling admission to our theme parks. We engage with travel agents, ticket resellers and travel agencies, and directly with our guests through our websites and social media, to promote advanced ticket sales and provide guest convenience and ease of entry. Guests who visit our theme parks have the option of purchasing multiple types of admission tickets, from single and multi-day tickets to season or annual passes. In addition, visitors can purchase vacation packages with preferred hotels, behind-the-scenes tours and educational animal encounters, specialty dining packages, and front of the line “Quick Queue” access to enhance their experience. We actively use pricing and promotions to manage capacity and maximize revenue. We utilize demand-based pricing for select peak time periods at some of our parks, advance purchase discounts to encourage early commitment, and seasonal pricing models to drive demand in non-peak time periods. Additionally, in 2020, we introduced an online reservation system to help manage capacity and we are managing the number of operating days, operating hours and staffing needs by park to optimize cash flow. Culinary Offerings We strive to deliver a variety of high quality, creative and memorable culinary experiences for our guests. Our culinary team focuses on providing creative menu offerings and ways to deliver those offerings that appeal to our diverse guest base. We offer a variety of dining programs that provide quality food and great value to our guests and drive incremental revenues. While our menu offerings have broad appeal, they also cater to guests who desire healthy options and those with special allergy-related needs. Our all-day-dining program delivers convenience and value to our guests with numerous restaurant choices for one price. We also offer creative immersive dining experiences that allow guests to dine up-close with our animals and characters. Our commitment to care for the natural world extends to the food that we serve. Some of our menus feature sustainable, organic, seasonal, and locally grown ingredients that aim to minimize environmental impacts to animals and their habitats. In addition, through culinary supply chain management initiatives, we are well-positioned to take advantage of changing economic and market conditions. Merchandise We offer guests the opportunity to capture memories through our products and services, including through traditional retail shops, game venues and customized photos. We make a focused effort to leverage the emotional connection of the theme park experiences, capitalize on trends, and optimize brand alignment with our merchandise product offerings. In-park games are designed with the goal of creating positive family experiences for guests of every age. Our merchandise teams also focus on making a visit to our theme parks easy, convenient, and comfortable. This includes offering lockers or service vehicle rentals such as strollers, electric personal carts and wheelchairs. Consumer Products and Licensing To capitalize on our popular brands, we leverage content through licensing and consumer product arrangements. We developed licensed consumer products to drive consumer sales through retail channels beyond our theme parks and continue to look for this channel to grow. While currently these licensed consumer products do not represent a significant percentage of our total revenue, we believe by leveraging our brands and our intellectual property through consumer products, we will create new revenue streams and enhance the value of our brands through greater brand visibility, consumer awareness and increased consumer loyalty. In addition, we have expanded our brand appeal through strategic alliances with well-known external brands, including Sesame Street. We have also incorporated Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer™ and other well-known characters into five of our park holiday programs under a license agreement with Character Arts, LLC, which currently runs through January 2024. 13 Group Events At times we host a variety of different group events and meetings at our theme parks, both during the day and at night. Our parks provide a wide variety of unique venues, backdrops and products for groups and include venues such as the icy walls of Antarctica, concert ready stadiums, outdoor pavilions, animal habitats and fully air-conditioned ballrooms. Our special group ticket packages and offerings appeal to specialty markets such as youth, sports, social (e.g. family reunions) and fraternal groups, as well as corporate groups seeking to recognize and reward their employees. Park buy-outs have historically allowed groups to enjoy exclusive itineraries, including meetings, educational presentations and shows, up-close encounters with animals and behind-the-scenes tours. Our group facilities are available year-round and fully customizable as they can be built around any of the park’s special events, educational presentations, inspirational shows, or one-of-a-kind attractions. Each of our theme parks offers attractive venues, such as SeaWorld Orlando’s Ports of Call, a 70,000 square foot dedicated special events complex and banquet facility that includes a ballroom, a collection of four outdoor pavilions and a courtyard in Orlando, or a fully enclosed and air-conditioned pavilion in Tampa. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related impacts on the travel industry, group events in 2020 were impacted. See the “— Impact of Global COVID-19 Pandemic ” and “Risk Factors ” sections included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial performance. Corporate Sponsorships and Strategic Alliances We seek to secure long-term corporate sponsorships and strategic alliances with leading companies and brands that share our core values, deliver significant brand value, and influence and drive mutual business gains. We identify prospective corporate sponsors based on their industry and industry-leading position, and we select them based on their ability to deliver impactful value to our theme parks and our brands, as well as to consumer products and various entertainment platforms. Our corporate sponsors contribute to us in a multitude of ways, such as through direct marketing, advertising, media exposure and licensing opportunities, as well as through contributions to the non-profit SeaWorld & Busch Gardens Conservation Fund. Also see additional discussion concerning our conservation partnerships, such as Guy Harvey, in the “ —Conservation and Community Relations” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Seasonality See the seasonality discussion in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our Markets, Guests and Customers Our theme parks are entertainment venues with broad demographic appeal and are located near a number of large metropolitan areas, including 6 of the 10 most populous metropolitan areas in the United States and 8 of the top 25 Best Destinations in the United States (U.S. Census, 2020; TripAdvisor, 2020) . Additionally, because our theme parks are divided between regional and destination theme parks, historically our guests have included local visitors, non-local domestic visitors and international visitors. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related impacts, travel from domestic and international markets were impacted in 2020. See the “— Impact of Global COVID-19 Pandemic ” and “Risk Factors ” sections included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. Intellectual Property Our business is affected by our ability to protect against infringement of our intellectual property, including our trademarks, service marks, domain names, copyrights, and other proprietary rights. Important intellectual property includes rights in names, logos, character likenesses, theme park attractions and systems related to the study and care of certain of our animals. In addition, we are party to key license agreements as licensee, including our agreements with Anheuser-Busch, Incorporated (“ABI”) and Sesame Workshop (“Sesame”) as discussed below. Busch Gardens License Agreement Our subsidiary, SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment LLC, is a party to a trademark license agreement with ABI, which governs our use of the Busch Gardens name and logo. Under the license agreement, ABI granted to us a perpetual, exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use the Busch Gardens trademark and certain related domain names in connection with the operation, marketing, promotion and advertising of our theme parks, as well as in connection with the production, use, distribution and sale of merchandise sold in connection with such theme parks. 14 The license extends to our Busch Gardens theme parks located in Williamsburg, Virginia and Tampa, Florida, and may also include any amusement or theme park anywhere in the world that we acquire, build or rebrand with the Busch Gardens name in the future, subject to certain conditions. ABI may not assign, transfer or sell the Busch Gardens mark without first granting us a reasonable right of first refusal to purchase such mark. We have agreed to indemnify ABI from and against third party claims and losses arising out of or in connection with the operation of the theme parks and the related marketing or promotion thereof, any merchandise branded with the licensed marks and the infringement of a third party’s intellectual property. We are required to carry certain insurance coverage throughout the term of the license. The license agreement can be terminated by ABI under certain limited circumstances, including in connection with certain types of change of control of SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment LLC. Sesame License Agreement Our wholly-owned subsidiary, SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc. (“SEA”), is a party to a license agreement with Sesame, a New York not-for-profit corporation. The License Agreement extends SEA’s status as Sesame’s exclusive theme park partner in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands (the “Sesame Territory”), with a second Sesame Place ® theme park scheduled to open no later than mid-2021. On October 21, 2019, we announced that we will open our second Sesame Place theme park at the site of the current Aquatica San Diego in the spring of 2021. While construction began in the fall of 2019, it was temporarily paused due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We currently expect to open this park in 2022. After the opening of Sesame Place San Diego, we will have the option to build additional Sesame Place theme parks in the Sesame Territory. Under the terms of the license agreement, including the requirement for certain subsequent approvals from Sesame, Sesame granted SEA the right to use the Sesame Street Elements (as defined below) (a) in connection with the design, building, installation, theming, promotion, and operation of SEA’s existing Sesame Place theme park, located in Langhorne, Pennsylvania (the “Langhorne Sesame Place”) and additional Sesame Place theme parks in the United States, including the recently announced Sesame Street San Diego (collectively, the “Standalone Parks”); (b) in connection with the design, building, installation, theming, promotion, and operation of SEA’s existing Sesame Lands (currently known as Sesame Street ® Land at SeaWorld Orlando, which opened in spring of 2019, Sesame Street Bay of Play at SeaWorld San Antonio, Sesame Street Bay of Play at SeaWorld San Diego, Sesame Street Safari of Fun at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay, and Sesame Street Forest of Fun at Busch Gardens Williamsburg) and additional Sesame Lands, (collectively, the “Sesame Lands”); (c) in connection with the Licensed Products (as defined below); (d) in marketing and promotional activities related to the Standalone Parks and Sesame Lands, including without limitation, marketing, advertising and promotion, character appearances and live presentations (both in park and in off-site promotional activities such as schools, parades, conventions, etc.), and the Licensed Products; and/or (e) to seek and to enter into sponsorship agreements for specific sponsorships of Sesame Street -themed attractions. In addition, SEA has been granted a license to (i) develop and manufacture or have developed and manufactured products that utilize the Sesame Street Elements or to purchase products that utilize the Sesame Street Elements from Sesame’s third party licensees (collectively, the “Licensed Products”), (ii) to market, promote, advertise, distribute and sell the Licensed Products within each of SEA’s theme parks and through online stores on SEA’s websites and targeted primarily to consumers in the United States and (iii) to contract with third party vendors to promote, distribute and sell the Licensed Products within the United States. The term “Sesame Street Elements” means all current and hereafter developed or owned titles, marks, names, characters (including any new Sesame Street characters shown on Sesame Street and owned in whole or controlled by Sesame), images, likenesses, audio, video, audiovisual, logos, themes, symbols, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, visual representations and designs, and other intellectual property (whether in two- or three-dimensional form and including animated and mechanical representations) owned or controlled by Sesame (or its affiliates), and associated with the “ Sesame Street ” television property, whether previously (unless retired) or currently on “ Sesame Street ” or whether hereafter developed or owned and the names and marks “ Sesame Place ” and “ Sesame Land, ” but expressly excluding “Kermit the Frog.” Sesame has reserved rights to build family entertainment centers using the Sesame Street Elements subject to certain territorial restrictions surrounding SEA’s Sesame Place Standalone Parks and Sesame Lands within the Sesame Territory. The license agreement has an initial term through December 31, 2031, with an automatic additional 15 year extension plus a 5 year option added from each new Standalone Park opening. Pursuant to the license agreement, SEA pays a specified annual license fee, as well as a specified royalty based on revenues earned in connection with sales of Licensed Products, all food and beverage items utilizing the licensed elements and any events utilizing such elements if a separate fee is paid for such event. 15 International Development Strategy We believe that in addition to the growth potential that exists domestically, our brands can also have significant appeal in certain international markets. We continue to make progress in our partnership with Miral Asset Management LLC to develop SeaWorld Abu Dhabi, a first-of-its-kind marine life themed park on Yas Island (the “Middle East Project”). As part of this partnership, we are providing certain services pertaining to the planning and design of the Middle East Project, with funding received from our partner in the Middle East expected to offset our internal expenses. Construction for the Middle East Project is on track and scheduled to be completed by the end of 2022. For a discussion of certain risks associated with our international development strategy, including the Middle East Project, see the “ Risk Factors ” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “ Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry—We may not realize the benefits of developments, restructurings, acquisitions or other strategic initiatives .” Our Industry In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted the theme park industry causing complete shutdowns or extended periods of closure. Some theme parks have chosen to partially reopen with capacity limitations and enhanced safety protocols, which have allowed them to resume operations but with lower levels of attendance. With the widespread introduction and reception of vaccines to fight COVID-19, we believe the industry will eventually return to its pre-COVID-19 levels of significant cash flow generation and growth. We believe that the theme park industry is an attractive sector characterized by a proven business model that over the long-term generates significant cash flow and has avenues for growth. Theme parks offer a strong consumer value proposition, particularly when compared to other forms of out-of-home entertainment such as concerts, sporting events, cruises and movies. As a result, theme parks attract a broad range of guests and generally exhibit strong operating margin across regions, operators, park types and macroeconomic conditions. Competition Our theme parks and other product and entertainment offerings compete directly for discretionary spending with other destination and regional theme parks and water and amusement parks and indirectly with other types of recreational facilities and forms of entertainment, including movies, home entertainment options, sports attractions, restaurants and vacation travel. Principal direct competitors of our theme parks include theme parks operated by The Walt Disney Company, Universal Parks and Resorts, Six Flags Entertainment Corporation, Cedar Fair, L.P., Merlin Entertainments ltd., and Hershey Entertainment and Resorts Company. Our highly differentiated products provide a value proposition and a complementary experience to those offered by fantasy-themed Disney and Universal parks. In addition, we benefit from the significant capital investments made in developing the tourism industry in the Orlando area. The Orlando theme park market is extremely competitive, with a high concentration of theme parks operated by several companies. Competition is based on multiple factors including location, price, the originality and perceived quality of the rides and attractions, the atmosphere and cleanliness of the theme park, the quality of food and entertainment, weather conditions, ease of travel to the theme park (including direct flights by major airlines), availability and cost of transportation to a theme park, industry best practices and perceptions as to safety. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe the level of attendance at theme parks has been and will continue to be impacted by public concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of reported local cases of COVID-19, travel restrictions, federal, state and local regulations related to public places, limits on social gatherings and overall public safety sentiment. We believe we can compete effectively, due to our strong brand recognition, unique and extensive zoological collection, diversity of product offerings and locations, targeted capital investments, guest sentiment related to our rescue and conservation efforts, and valuable real estate. Additionally, we believe that our theme parks feature a sufficient quality and variety of rides and attractions, educational and interactive experiences, merchandise locations, restaurants and family orientation to make them highly competitive with other destination and regional theme parks, as well as other forms of entertainment. 16 Regulatory Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances including, but not limited to, those regulating the environment, display, possession and care of our animals, amusement park rides, building and construction, health and safety, labor and employment, workplace safety, zoning and land use and alcoholic beverage and food service. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have had to comply with rapidly changing local, state and federal rules, orders and regulations. Key statutes and treaties relating to the display, possession and care of our zoological collection include the Endangered Species Act, Marine Mammal Protection Act, Animal Welfare Act, Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species and Fauna Protection Act and the Lacey Act. We must also comply with the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, Wild Bird Conservation Act and National Environmental Policy Act, among other laws and regulations. We believe that we are in compliance with applicable laws, regulations and ordinances; however, such requirements may change over time, and there can be no assurance that new requirements, changes in enforcement policies or newly discovered conditions relating to our properties or operations will not require significant expenditures in the future. Recent Regulatory Developments The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”) released a proposed rule on February 3, 2016 to amend the Animal Welfare Act regulations concerning the humane handling, care and treatment of marine mammals in captivity (the “Proposed APHIS Regulations”). The Proposed APHIS Regulations were subject to public comment which ended on May 4, 2016. We submitted a comment letter to APHIS expressing our views on the Proposed APHIS Regulations. The full impact of the Proposed APHIS Regulations on our business will not be known until the Proposed APHIS Regulations are finalized. These Proposed APHIS Regulations were not listed as a priority for APHIS indicating that the agency did not plan any further action at that time on the matter. However, there can be no assurance that APHIS will not propose or enact regulations that could materially impact the Company in the future. In December 2020, the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs released its latest Semiannual Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions for Fall 2020 (the “Fall 2020 Unified Agenda”). APHIS did include on the Fall 2020 Unified Agenda a notice that it was planning to release a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in or around June 2021 related to contingency plans for the handling of animals. This rulemaking would amend Animal Welfare Act regulations to add requirements for contingency planning and training of personnel by research facilities and by dealers, exhibitors, intermediate handlers, and carriers. APHIS says this action would heighten the awareness of licensees and registrants regarding their responsibilities and help ensure a timely and appropriate response should an emergency or disaster occur. Likewise, the full impact of these Proposed APHIS Regulations on our business will not be known until the Proposed APHIS Regulations are released. For a discussion of certain risks associated with federal and state regulations governing the treatment of animals, see the “ Risk Factors ” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “ Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry—We are subject to complex federal and state regulations governing the treatment of animals, which can change, and to claims and lawsuits by activist groups before government regulators and in the courts. ” We face a rapidly changing regulatory environment across our business, including responses to COVID-19, wages and hour regulations, employee health and benefit requirement and the policy agenda of the new U.S. President and his administration to name a few. For more detailed discussion, see the “Impact of Global COVID-19 Pandemic” section and the following under the “Risk Factors” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, “ The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our business and will adversely affect our results of operations and various other factors beyond our control could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations; Increased labor costs and employee health and welfare benefits may negatively impact our operations; and The policies of the recently elected U.S. President and his administration or any changes to tax laws may result in a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial condition and may impact our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards.” Insurance We maintain insurance of the type and in the amounts that we believe to be commercially reasonable for businesses in our industry. We maintain primary and excess casualty coverage of up to $100.0 million. As part of this coverage, we retain deductible/self-insured retention exposures consistent with our normal expected losses related to general liability claims, automobile liability and workers’ compensation claims. We maintain employers’ liability and all coverage required by law in the states in which we operate. Defense costs are included in the insurance coverage we obtain against losses in these areas. Based upon our historical experience of reported claims and an estimate for incurred-but-not-reported claims, we accrue a liability for our deductible/self-insured retention contingencies regarding general liability, automobile liability and workers’ compensation exposures. We maintain additional forms of special casualty coverage which we believe is appropriate for our business. We also maintain commercial property coverage against fire, natural perils, so-called “extended coverage” perils such as civil commotion, business interruption and terrorism exposures for protection of our real and personal properties (other than land). We generally renegotiate our insurance policies on an annual basis. We cannot predict the amounts of premium cost that we may be required to pay for future insurance coverage, the level of any deductibles/self-insured retentions or co-insurance we may retain applicable thereto, the level of aggregate excess coverage 17 available, the availability of coverage for special or specific risks or whether the amount of insurance will be sufficient to cover all actual perils that may occur. For example, we expect that most of our losses related to the impacts of the COVID -19 pandemic will not be covered by insurance available to us and /or insurers may contest coverage . Corporate History Our legacy started in 1959 with the opening of our first Busch Gardens theme park in Tampa, Florida. Since then, we have grown our portfolio of strong brands and strategically expanded across five states. On December 1, 2009, investment funds affiliated with The Blackstone Group L.P. and certain co-investors, through SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc. (“SEA”), acquired 100% of the equity interests of Sea World LLC (f/k/a Sea World, Inc.) and SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment LLC (f/k/a Busch Entertainment Corporation) from certain subsidiaries of Anheuser-Busch Companies, Inc. We refer to this acquisition and related financing transactions as the “2009 Transactions.” SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware on October 2, 2009 in connection with the 2009 Transactions and changed its name from SW Holdco, Inc. to SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. in December 2012. We completed our initial public offering (the “IPO”) in April 2013 and our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “SEAS”. On May 8, 2017, an affiliate of ZHG Group, Sun Wise (UK) Co., LTD. (“ZHG”) acquired approximately 21% of the then outstanding shares of our common stock from certain affiliates of Blackstone (the “Seller”), pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement between ZHG and the Seller (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”). ZHG pledged such shares in connection with certain loan obligations of ZHG (the “Pledged Shares”). ZHG subsequently defaulted on such loan obligations and, as a result, certain lenders (the “Lenders”) foreclosed on the Pledged Shares and, accordingly, the Pledged Shares were transferred to a security agent for the Lenders (the “Security Agent”), on May 3, 2019. On May 27, 2019, the Security Agent entered into a share repurchase agreement with us pursuant to which the Security Agent agreed to sell and we agreed to purchase 5,615,874 of the Pledged Shares held by the Security Agent (the “SEAS Repurchase”). On May 27, 2019, the Security Agent also entered into a stock purchase agreement with Hill Path Capital LP (“Hill Path”) and certain of its affiliates pursuant to which the Security Agent agreed to sell and certain affiliates of Hill Path agreed to purchase, in the aggregate, 13,214,000 of the Pledged Shares held by the Security Agent. The purchase closed on May 30, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, Hill Path owned approximately 34.7% of our total outstanding common stock.

financial condition and results of operations. • Actions of activist stockholders, and such activism could adversely impact the value of our securities. • Affiliates of Hill Path Capital LP could be able to significantly influence our decisions and their interests may conflict with ours or yours in the future. • The policies of the recently elected U.S. President and his administration or any changes to tax laws may result in a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial condition and may impact our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards. Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock • Our stock price may change significantly, and you may not be able to sell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid or at all, and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result. • We cannot guarantee that our allocation of capital to various alternatives will enhance long-term stockholder value, and in some cases, our Share Repurchase Program could increase the volatility of the price of our common stock. • Future sales, or the perception of future sales, by us or our existing stockholders in the public market could cause the market price for our common stock to decline. • Our indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock in the future. • Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control. • The concentration of ownership of our capital stock limits your ability to influence corporate matters. • Non-U.S. holders who own or owned more than a certain ownership threshold may be subject to United States federal income tax on gains realized on the disposition of our common stock. 20 The following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating us and this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain statements in “Risk Factors” are forward-looking statements. See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” elsewhere in this report: Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our business and will adversely affect our results of operations and various other factors beyond our control could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, quarantines, significant travel warnings and restrictions, social distancing rules, curfews and shelter-in-place have been implemented and may be re-implemented pursuant to federal, state and local orders and mandates. From March 16, 2020 to June 5, 2020, we temporarily closed all of our theme parks and therefore, did not generate revenue from our parks during the closure period. Beginning on June 6, 2020, we began the phased reopening of some of our parks. Although some of our parks have been permitted to re-open with limited capacity, the extent and duration of any negative impacts over the longer term remain uncertain and dependent on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time. It is also impossible to predict the severity and transmission rate of COVID-19, the impact of any mutations of the virus, the extent and effectiveness of any vaccine or containment actions taken, and the impact of these and other factors on travel and consumer behavior. It is possible that the spread of COVID-19, the resulting economic and societal impact, social distancing or other safety requirements existing today or that may be implemented will reduce our guests’ interest or ability to visit our theme parks. The COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken in response, pose the risk that we or our employees, contractors, suppliers, and other business partners may be prevented from conducting business activities for an unknown period of time. Restrictions on travel, quarantines and other measures imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as ongoing concern regarding the virus’ potential impact, have had and will likely continue to have a negative effect on economies and financial markets, including supply chain shortages and additional business disruptions. Any such impacts could have a material adverse effect on our business. In response to our park closures, we took steps to minimize our cash outflows, manage costs and expenditures and maximize liquidity. Some of these measures included, but were not limited to (i) substantially reduced or deferred all capital projects while our parks were closed other than a minimal amount of essential projects and maintenance and postponed the opening of rides that were still under construction and scheduled to open in 2020; (ii) eliminated and/or deferred all non-essential operating expenses at all of our parks and corporate headquarters while the parks were closed and actively managing operating expenses; (iii) eliminated substantially all advertising and marketing spend while the parks were closed and strategically managing marketing spend as parks reopen; (iv) temporarily reduced Executive Officer base pay by 20% through November 2020; (v) worked with certain vendors and other business partners to manage, defer, and/or abate certain costs and payments; and (vi) initially furloughing approximately 95% of our employees upon closing all of our parks. It is unclear if any of these actions could have a lasting negative impact on our relationships with vendors, current and/or future business partners or ambassadors or, if parks are forced to close again, whether we will be forced to take similar actions and be able to achieve similar cost savings. We have been sued and may face additional lawsuits or damage to our reputation related to actions taken or not taken as a result of COVID-19 from current and/or future vendors, customers and/or ambassadors. The lawsuits could negatively impact our cash flows and results of operations; however none have been material to date. Also, another prolonged closure of our parks could materially impact our results, operations and financial condition. Additionally, due to the uncertainties created by the COVID-19 pandemic and the related impact on our business, we have made or may make future employment or restructuring decisions which may subject us to increased risks related to employment matters, including increased union organizing activity, litigation and/or claims for severance or other benefits. In March 2020, we increased borrowings under our revolving credit facility as a precautionary measure to increase our cash position and in April 2020 we issued $227.5 million aggregate principal amount of 8.750% first-priority senior secured notes due 2025 to raise capital and provide additional liquidity for a sustained period and to preserve financial flexibility in light of uncertainty in the global markets resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we entered into amendments to our Amended Credit Agreement to amend certain provisions therein . Pursuant to the most recent amendment, we will be exempt from complying with our first lien secured leverage ratio covenant through the end of 2021 and will be required to comply with a quarterly minimum liquidity coverage test (defined as unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and available commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility) of not less than $75.0 million until the earlier of September 30, 2022 or the date we elect to use actual Adjusted EBITDA for purposes of calculating our financial maintenance covenant. There is no certainty we will be able to meet this test and failure to meet this test could result in events of default under our debt agreements, acceleration of our outstanding debt and materially affect our financial condition and results of operations. On August 5, 2020, we issued $500.0 million of 9.500% second-priority senior secured notes due 2025 which provided us with net proceeds of approximately $489.9 million. As of December 31, 2020, total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents was approximately $433.9 million and $311.3 million was available under our revolving credit facility. 21 We cannot be certain that we will continue to have access to sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations for the time required to allow our cash generating operations to normalize. The effect of COVID-19 on the capital markets could significantly impact our cost of borrowing and the availability of capital to us. COVID-19 also makes it more challenging for management to estimate the future performance of our business and/or our liquidity needs, particularly over the near to medium term. We may not be able to obtain additional liquidity and any relief provided by lenders, governmental agencies, and business partners may not be adequate and may include onerous terms. We had never previously experienced a complete cessation of our operations, and as a consequence, our ability to be predictive regarding the impact of such a cessation on our operations and future prospects is uncertain. In addition, the magnitude, duration and speed of the global pandemic is uncertain. As a consequence, we cannot estimate the impact on our business, financial condition or near or longer-term financial or operational results with certainty. As we continue to make progress in the reopening of our theme parks, we may face additional costs and obstacles in complying with any new federal, state or local regulations or industry best practices established in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, re-integrating our furloughed employees and attracting guests who may not wish to travel or visit our theme parks for a prolonged period. In addition, any measures we take or may be required to take such as limiting capacity in our theme parks, enforcing social distancing requirements and / or requiring masks, may negatively impact attendance at our theme parks. It is not possible to predict what steps, if any, we may be required to take if the COVID-19 pandemic worsens. It is possible we could be forced to close some or all of our parks again. In fact, in compliance with revised state government restrictions issued late in the fourth quarter in California, we once again closed our SeaWorld park in California effective December 7, 2020. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and results of operations. A single case of COVID-19 in a theme park could result in additional costs and further closures. If we do not continue to respond appropriately to the pandemic, or if customers do not perceive our response to be adequate, we could suffer damage to our reputation, which could significantly adversely affect our business. Furthermore, the effects of the pandemic on our business could be long-lasting and could continue to have adverse effects, some of which may be significant, and which may indefinitely impact our ability to operate our business in the traditional, pre-pandemic manner. Our business also could be significantly affected should the disruptions caused by COVID-19 lead to systemic changes in consumer behavior. The outbreak of COVID-19 has significantly increased economic uncertainty. It is possible that the current outbreak or continued spread of COVID-19 could cause a global recession, which could further adversely affect our business, and such adverse effects may be material. Further, our results of operations and financial condition would be negatively impacted if we experience another prolonged period of closure, experience significant declines in business volumes, are unable to return to normalized performance levels or attendance at our parks is limited due to capacity restrictions. Our properties are subject to the risk that operations could be halted for a temporary or extended period of time. If there is a prolonged disruption at any of our properties, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects will likely be materially adversely affected. Additionally, if a prolonged downturn of general economic or other conditions in the areas in which our properties are located or from which we draw our guests or prevents guests from easily coming to our properties, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects will be materially adversely affected. We are subject to complex federal and state regulations governing the treatment of animals, which can change, and to claims and lawsuits by activist groups before government regulators and in the courts. We operate in a complex and evolving regulatory environment and are subject to various federal and state statutes and regulations and international treaties implemented by federal law. The states in which we operate also regulate zoological activity involving the import and export of exotic and native wildlife, endangered and/or otherwise protected species, zoological display and anti-cruelty statutes. We incur significant compliance costs in connection with these regulations and violation of such regulations could subject us to fines and penalties and result in the loss of our licenses and permits, which, if occurred, could impact our ability to display certain animals. Future amendments to existing statutes, regulations and treaties or new statutes, regulations and treaties or lawsuits against the Company, government agencies or other third parties in the zoological industry may potentially restrict our ability to maintain our animals, or to acquire new ones to supplement or sustain our breeding programs or otherwise adversely affect our business. In 2016, the California Orca Protection Act was enacted into law and (i) codified the end of captive breeding programs and the export and import of genetic materials for orcas in California, (ii) prohibits the import or export of new orcas into or existing orcas out of California, (iii) permits the transfer of orcas currently in California among existing SeaWorld facilities and (iv) requires educational presentations of orcas in California. We introduced new orca programs in our San Diego park in 2017 which are consistent with these standards. In the past, Congress has proposed legislation that would have impacted the breeding, the taking (wild capture), and the import or export of orcas for the purposes of public display and the transport of orcas from one park to another. Also, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”) has proposed regulations that could impact our business. For example, APHIS included on the Fall 2020 Unified Agenda a notice that it was planning to release a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in June 2021 related to contingency plans for the handling of animals. This rulemaking would amend Animal Welfare Act regulations to add requirements for contingency planning and training of personnel by research facilities and by dealers, 22 exhibitors, intermediate handlers, and carriers. APHIS says this action would heighten the awareness of licensees and registrants regarding their responsibilities and help ensure a timely and appropriate response should an emergency or disaster occur. There can be no assurance that Congress will not pass legislation or that APHIS or other federal, state or local jurisdictions will not propose or enact additional laws or regulations that could materially impact the Company in the future . In light of the uncertain legal, legislative and regulatory environment and evolving public sentiment, we continue to evaluate a broad spectrum of enhancements, modifications and alternatives with respect to the display, husbandry and breeding practices, handling and care, and study and research of our orcas and other marine animals. Any decisions regarding such matters are subject to consideration and assessment of various factors including, but not limited to, the health and welfare of the animals, guest sentiment, market conditions, anticipated impact on our business, regulatory environment, legal proceedings, and input from our conservation partners, and other factors. If we were to pursue or be required to pursue any alternative approaches with respect to the display, husbandry and breeding practices, handling and care, or study and research of our orcas or other animals in our zoological collection, the full impact of such alternatives on our business will not be known until such alternatives are finalized. In the meantime, we continue to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate the impact of and ensure compliance with the applicable regulatory and other developments. We are subject to scrutiny by activist and other third-party groups and/or media who can pressure governmental agencies, vendors, partners, and/or regulators, bring action in the courts or create negative publicity about us. From time to time, animal activist and other third-party groups may make claims before government agencies, bring lawsuits against us, and/or attempt to generate negative publicity associated with our business. Such activities sometimes are based on allegations that we do not properly care for some of our animals. On other occasions, such activities are specifically designed to change existing law or enact new law in order to impede our ability to retain, exhibit, acquire or breed animals. While we seek to structure our operations to comply with all applicable federal and state laws and vigorously defend ourselves when sued, there are no assurances as to the outcome of claims and lawsuits that could be brought against us or new laws or changes to existing laws that could negatively impact us. Even if not successful, these lawsuits, or proposed changes to laws, can require deployment of our resources and can lead to negative publicity. Negative publicity created by activists or in the media could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. At times, activists and other third-party groups have also attempted to generate negative publicity related to our relationships with our business partners, such as corporate sponsors, promotional partners, vendors, ticket resellers and others. These activities have at times led relationships with some ticket resellers to be terminated. Although sales from any particular ticket reseller may not constitute a significant portion of our ticket sales, if a relationship with a ticket reseller is terminated, we will attempt to find alternative distribution channels. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful or that those channels will be as successful or not have additional costs. If we are unable to find cost effective alternative distribution channels, the loss of multiple ticket resellers could have a negative impact on our results of operations. Various factors beyond our control could adversely affect attendance and guest spending patterns at our theme parks. Various factors beyond our control could adversely affect attendance and guest spending patterns at our theme parks. These factors could also affect our suppliers, vendors, insurance carriers and other contractual counterparties. Such factors include but are not limited to: • bad weather and even forecasts of bad weather, including abnormally hot, cold, snow/ice and/or wet weather, particularly during weekends, holidays or other peak periods; • natural disasters, such as hurricanes, fires, earthquakes, tsunamis, tornados, floods and volcanic eruptions and man-made disasters such as oil spills, which may deter travelers from scheduling vacations or cause them to cancel travel or vacation plans; • fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; • low consumer confidence; • outbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases or consumers’ concerns relating to potential exposure to travel-related health concerns such as pandemics and epidemics such as Coronavirus, Ebola, Zika, Influenza H1N1, avian bird flu, SARS and MERS; • changes in the desirability of particular locations or travel patterns of both our domestic and international guests; • oil prices and travel costs and the financial condition of the airline, automotive and other transportation-related industries, any travel-related disruptions or incidents and their impact on travel or decrease transportation options to cities where we have parks; • war, terrorist activities or threats and heightened travel security measures instituted in response to these events; 23 • actions or statements by U.S. and foreign governmental officials related to travel and corporate travel-related activities (including changes to the U.S. visa rules or disease related restrictions or testing requirements) and the resulting public perception of such travel and activities; and • interruption of public or private utility services to our theme parks. Any one or more of these factors could adversely affect attendance, revenue, and per capita spending at our theme parks, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates impact our business. A strong dollar increases the cost for international tourists and could impact their spending. In addition, demand for our parks is highly dependent on the general environment for travel and tourism, which can be significantly adversely affected by extreme weather events, including ice and snow conditions. Any of these such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Additionally, because many of the attractions at our parks are outdoors, attendance at our parks is adversely affected by bad or extreme weather conditions and forecasts of bad or mixed weather conditions, which negatively affects our revenues and results of operations. For example, attendance at our parks in 2019 was negatively impacted by Hurricane Dorian over Labor Day weekend. Separately, we have previously also experienced negative impacts from weather events in other parks, particularly hurricanes, which have caused park closures in Tampa and Orlando and park closures and other weather impacts in Texas and Virginia. Incidents or adverse publicity concerning our theme parks, the theme park industry or zoological facilities generally could harm our brands or reputation as well as negatively impact our revenues and profitability. Our brands and our reputation are among our most important assets. Our ability to attract and retain guests depends, in part, upon the external perceptions of the Company, the quality and safety of our theme parks and services and our corporate and management integrity. The operation of theme parks involves the risk of accidents, illnesses, environmental incidents and other incidents which may negatively affect the perception of guest and employee safety, health, security and guest satisfaction and which could negatively impact our brands or reputation and our business and results of operations. An accident or an injury at any of our theme parks or at theme parks operated by competitors, particularly an accident or an injury involving the safety of guests and employees, that receives media attention, is the topic of a book, film, documentary or is otherwise the subject of public discussions, may harm our brands or reputation, cause a loss of consumer confidence in the Company, reduce attendance at our theme parks and negatively impact our results of operations. Such incidents have occurred in the past and may occur in the future. In addition, other types of adverse publicity concerning our business, the theme park industry or zoological facilities generally could harm our brands, reputation, and results of operations. The considerable expansion in the use of social media over recent years has compounded the impact of negative publicity. There has been and may continue to be perception issues and negative media attention that create a barrier to attendance at our parks which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We could be adversely affected by a decline in discretionary consumer spending or consumer confidence. Our success depends to a significant extent on discretionary consumer spending, which is heavily influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income. In the past, severe economic downturns, coupled with high volatility and uncertainty as to the future global economic landscape, have had an adverse effect on consumers’ discretionary income and consumer confidence. Volatile, negative, or uncertain economic conditions and recessionary periods may adversely impact attendance figures, the frequency with which guests choose to visit our theme parks and guest spending patterns at our theme parks. The actual or perceived weakness in the economy could also lead to decreased spending by our guests. For example, in 2009 and 2010, we experienced a decline in attendance as a result of the global economic crisis, which in turn adversely affected our revenue and profitability. Both attendance and total revenue per capita spending at our theme parks are key drivers of our revenue and profitability, and reductions in either can materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. A significant portion of our revenues are historically generated in the States of Florida, California and Virginia. Any risks affecting such markets, such as natural disasters, severe weather and travel-related disruptions or incidents, may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In 2020, more than 70% of our revenues were generated in the State of Florida, due in part to the temporary park closures and limited operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Historically, however, more than 50% of our revenues are generated in the State of Florida with approximately 30% of our revenues generated from the States of California and Virginia combined. 24 Any risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, such as the occurrence of natural disasters and travel-related disruptions or incidents, affecting the States of Florida, California and Virginia generally may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, especially if they have the effect of decreasing attendance at our theme parks or, in extreme cases, cause us to close any of our theme parks for any period of time. For example, in 2019, Florida was negatively impacted by Hurricane Dorian . Also, our parks in Texas and Virginia have previously been negatively impacted by h urricane s . Although we attempt to manage our exposure to such events by implementing our hurricane preparedness plan, our theme parks located in Orlando and Tampa, Florida and in Williamsburg, Virginia have previously experienced closures as a result of storms, which negatively impact ed attendance and results of operations. Our operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations. We have historically experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in our annual theme park attendance and revenue, which are typically higher in our second and third quarters, partly because seven of our theme parks have historically only opened for a portion of the year. Historically, approximately two-thirds of our attendance and revenues are generated in the second and third quarters of the year and we typically incur a net loss in the first and fourth quarters. In addition, the timing of school vacations and school start dates also cause fluctuations in our quarterly theme park attendance and revenue. For example, revenues can shift between the first and second quarters due to the timing of Easter and spring break holidays and between the first and fourth quarters due to the timing of holiday breaks around Christmas and New Year. Even for our five theme parks that have historically been open year-round, attendance patterns have significant seasonality, driven by holidays, school vacations and weather conditions. Changes in school calendars that impact traditional school vacation breaks could also impact attendance patterns. Due in part to the temporary park closures, capacity limitations and modified/limited operations, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the seasonality of our business for 2020 and it is difficult to estimate how the COVID-19 pandemic will impact seasonality in the future. Furthermore, the operating season at some of our theme parks, including SeaWorld San Antonio, Aquatica San Antonio, Adventure Island, Aquatica San Diego, Busch Gardens Williamsburg, Water Country USA and Sesame Place, is of limited duration. In addition, historically most of our expenses for maintenance and costs of adding new attractions at our seasonal theme parks are incurred when the operating season is over, which may increase the need for borrowing to fund such expenses during such periods. When conditions or events described in this Risk Factor section occur during the operating season, particularly during the second and third quarters, there is only a limited period of time during which the impact of those conditions or events can be mitigated. Accordingly, such conditions or events may have a disproportionately adverse effect on our revenues and cash flow. Because we operate in a competitive industry, our revenues, profits or market share could be harmed if we are unable to compete effectively. Our theme parks compete with other theme, water and amusement parks and with other types of recreational facilities and forms of entertainment, including movies, home entertainment options, family entertainment centers, sports attractions, restaurants and vacation travel. Principal direct competitors of our theme parks include theme parks operated by The Walt Disney Company, Universal Parks and Resorts, Six Flags Entertainment Corporation, Cedar Fair, L.P., Merlin Entertainments ltd., Herschend Family Entertainment and Hershey Entertainment and Resorts Company. The principal competitive factors of a theme park include location, price, originality and perceived quality of the rides and attractions, the atmosphere and cleanliness of the theme park, the quality of its food and entertainment, weather conditions, ease of travel to the theme park (including direct flights by major airlines), and availability and cost of transportation to a theme park. Certain of our direct competitors have substantially greater financial resources than we do, and they may be able to adapt more quickly to changes in guest preferences or devote greater resources to their attractions or promotion of their offerings and attractions than us. Our competitors may be able to attract guests to their theme parks in lieu of our own through the development or acquisition of new rides, attractions or shows that are perceived by guests to be of a higher quality and entertainment value. As a result, we may not be able to compete successfully against such competitors. If we are unable to compete with new and existing attractions, our results of operations could be negatively impacted. 25 Featuring animals at our theme parks involves risks. Our theme parks feature numerous displays and interactions that include animals. All animal enterprises involve some degree of risk. All animal interactions by our employees and our guests in attractions in our theme parks, where offered, involves risk. While we maintain strict safety procedures for the protection of our employees and guests, injuries or death, while rare, have occurred in the past. For example, in February 2010, a trainer was killed while engaged in an interaction with an orca. Following this incident, we were subject to an inspection by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), which resulted in citations concerning alleged violations of the Occupational Safety and Health Act and certain regulations thereunder. In connection with this incident, we reviewed and revised our safety protocols and made certain safety-related facility enhancements such as revising training protocols used in animal presentations. This incident has also been and continues to be the subject of significant media attention, including extensive television and newspaper coverage, books, at least one documentary and discussions in social media. This incident and similar events that may occur in the future may harm our reputation, reduce attendance and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We maintain insurance of the type and in amounts that we believe are commercially reasonable and that are available to animal enterprise related businesses in the theme park industry. We cannot predict the level of the premiums that we may be required to pay for subsequent insurance coverage, the level of any self-insurance retention or co-insurance applicable thereto, the level of aggregate coverage available, the availability of coverage for specific risks, or whether insurance we do maintain will be sufficient. Animals in our care are important to our theme parks, and they could be exposed to infectious diseases. Many of our theme parks are distinguished from those of our competitors in that we offer guest interactions with animals in our care. Individual animals, specific species of animals or groups of animals in our zoological collection could be exposed to infectious diseases or could expose guests to infectious diseases. While we have never had any such experiences, an outbreak of an infectious disease among any animals in our theme parks or the public’s perception that a certain disease could be harmful to human health may materially adversely affect our zoological collection, our business, financial condition and results of operations. The high fixed cost structure of theme park operations can result in significantly lower margins if revenues decline. A large portion of our expenses is relatively fixed because the costs for employees, maintenance, animal care, utilities, advertising, and insurance do not vary significantly with attendance. These fixed costs may increase at a greater rate than our revenues and may not be able to be reduced at the same rate as declining revenues. If cost-cutting efforts are insufficient to offset declines in revenues or are impracticable, we could experience a material decline in margins, revenues, profitability and reduced or negative cash flows. Such effects can be especially pronounced during a pandemic or periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth. Changes in consumer tastes and preferences for entertainment and consumer products could reduce demand for our entertainment offerings and products and adversely affect the profitability of our business. The success of our business depends on our ability to consistently provide, maintain, and expand theme park attractions as well as create online material and consumer products that meet changing consumer preferences . In addition, consumers from outside the United States constitute an important portion of our theme park attendance, and our success depends in part on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to tastes and preferences of this consumer group. If our entertainment offerings and products do not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or if consumer preferences change, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Cyber security risks and the failure to maintain the integrity of internal or guest data could result in damages to our reputation, the disruption of operations and/or subject us to costs, fines or lawsuits. We collect internal and customer data for business purposes. This data may include personal identifiable information held in our various information technology systems which collect, process, summarize, and report such data. We also maintain personally identifiable information about our employees. The integrity and protection of our customer, employee and company data is critical to our business. Our guests and employees have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information. The regulatory environment, as well as the requirements imposed on us by the credit card industry, governing information, security and privacy laws is increasingly demanding and continues to evolve. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act took effect in January 2020 and imposes requirements for identifying, managing, securing, tracking, producing and deleting consumer privacy information in California. Maintaining compliance with applicable security and privacy regulations may increase our operating costs and/or adversely impact our ability to market our theme parks, products, and services to our guests. We also rely on accounting, financial and operational management information technology systems to conduct our operations. If these information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. 26 We face security threats, including but not limited to cyber security attacks on our data infrastructure. We expect to continue devoting significant resources to the security of our information technology systems and the training of our employees and we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate technological threats. There can be no assurance that these procedures, investments and/or controls will be sufficient to prevent penetrations, malicious acts or disruptions to our systems. Furthermore, a penetrated or compromised data system or the intentional, inadvertent or negligent release or disclosure of data could result in theft, loss, fraudulent or unlawful use of guest, employee, company or protected data which could harm our reputation or result in remedial and other costs, fines or lawsuits and require significant management attention and resources to be spent. In addition, our insurance coverage and indemnification arrangements that we enter into, if any, may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to cyber security attacks or disruptions resulting from such events. To date, cyber security attacks directed at us have not had a material impact on our financial results. Due to the evolving nature of security threats, however, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted. Technology interruptions or failures that impair access to our websites or information technology systems could adversely affect our business or operations. The satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our web sites and our infrastructure are critical to the conduct of our business. Any system interruptions that result in the unavailability or slowness of our websites could impact our ability to market or sell admissions or other products which could adversely affect our results of operations and/or result in negative publicity. We have in the past experienced, or may in the future experience, temporary system interruptions for a variety of reasons, including security incidents, viruses, telecommunication and other network failures, power failures, programming errors, undetected bugs, design faults, data corruption, denial-of-service attacks, legacy systems, poor scalability or network overload from an overwhelming number of traffic trying to reach our websites at the same time. Even a disruption as brief as a few minutes could have a negative impact on our online activities and could result in a loss of revenue. For example, there have been instances when our websites experienced slow performance and unavailability for some guests. Although these issues were short-lived and did not have a material impact to our results of operations, prolonged or repeat system interruptions and network failures could adversely impact our operations as a significant portion of our admissions revenues are from ticket purchases and reservations made online. Additionally, damage, failures or interruptions to our information technology systems may require a significant investment to update, remediate or replace with alternate systems, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations as a result. In addition, costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations and/or result in negative publicity. Any material interruptions or failures in our systems, including those that may result from our failure to adequately develop, implement and maintain a robust disaster recovery plan and backup systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance. Increased labor costs and employee health and welfare benefits may negatively impact our operations. Labor is a primary component in the cost of operating our business. We devote significant resources to recruiting and training our employees. Increased labor costs due to competition, increased minimum wage or employee benefit costs or otherwise, would adversely impact our operating expenses. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 and the amendments thereto contain provisions that have impacted our healthcare costs. Additionally, the new administration is encouraging Congress to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. Any future amendments or new legislation could significantly increase our compensation costs, which would reduce our net income and adversely affect our cash flows. In 2016, San Diego passed legislation which, after the first increase on January 1, 2017, increases its minimum wage over a six-year period to $15 an hour by January 1, 2023. After the San Diego minimum wage reaches $15 an hour, it will change based on the consumer price index. Virginia passed legislation that increases the state minimum wage to $9.50 an hour on May 1, 2021 and increases its minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2026. In November 2020, Florida passed a ballot initiative raising minimum wage to $10.00 per hour effective September 30th, 2021. Each September 30th thereafter, minimum wage shall increase by $1.00 per hour until the minimum wage reaches $15.00 per hour on September 30th, 2026. From that point forward, future minimum wage increases shall revert to being adjusted annually for inflation starting September 30th, 2027. In addition, a number of companies with whom we compete for talent have announced wage increases. Increases to the minimum wage in locations where we do business, wages of companies from whom we compete for talent and/or increased benefit costs will negatively impact our operating expenses. Our growth strategy may not achieve the anticipated results. Our future success will depend on our ability to grow our business, including through capital investments to improve existing and develop or acquire additional theme parks, rides, attractions and shows, as well as in-park product offerings and product offerings outside of our theme parks that are complementary to our parks. Our growth and innovation strategies require significant commitments of management resources and capital investments and may not grow our revenues at the rate we expect or at all. As a result, we may not be able to recover the costs incurred in developing our new projects and initiatives or to realize their intended or projected benefits, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 27 We may not be able to fund theme park capital expenditures and investment in future attractions and projects. A principal competitive factor for a theme park is the originality and perceived quality of its rides and attractions. We need to make continued capital investments through maintenance and the regular addition of new rides and attractions. Our ability to fund capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and to raise capital from third parties. We cannot assure you that our operations will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to fund such costs, or that we will be able to obtain sufficient financing on adequate terms, or at all, which could cause us to delay or abandon certain projects or plans. Adverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved in the normal course of our business could reduce our profits or limit our ability to operate our business. We are subject to allegations, claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business, which may include claims by third parties, including guests who visit our theme parks, our employees, stockholders and/or regulators. We are currently subject to securities litigation. We are also subject to audits, inspections and investigations by, or receives requests for information from, various federal and state regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”), the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“Cal-OSHA”), state departments of labor, the Florida Fish & Wildlife Commission (“FWC”), the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”), the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS” ), the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). From time to time, various parties may also bring lawsuits against us. For example, on February 11, 2020, we announced that we had entered into a settlement agreement with respect to a previously disclosed class action lawsuit commenced in 2014, captioned Baker v. SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc ., et al., Case No. 14-CV-02129-MMA (AGS) (“Baker”). The settlement required us to pay $65.0 million for claims alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as the costs of administration and legal fees and expenses. The settlement does not include or constitute an admission, concession, or finding of any fault, liability, or wrongdoing by us or any defendant. Also, in June 2017, we received a subpoena in connection with an investigation by the DOJ concerning certain disclosures and public statements made by us and certain individuals on or before August 2014, and trading in our securities. We also had received subpoenas from the staff of the SEC in connection with these matters. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we reached a settlement with the SEC. In connection with the settlement, without admitting or denying the substantive allegations in the SEC’s complaint, we agreed to the entry of a final judgment ordering us to pay a civil penalty of $4.0 million and enjoining us from violation of certain provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and certain rules thereunder. The settlement was approved by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on September 24, 2018. On December 11, 2018, the DOJ informed us that it does not intend to take any action against us or any individuals in connection with its investigation. We consider the DOJ matter concluded. We discuss securities litigation and other litigation to which we are subject in greater detail in “ Item 3. Legal Proceedings ” and Note 15–Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any proceedings, audits, inspections or investigations were to be determined adversely against us or resulted in legal actions, claims, regulatory proceedings, enforcement actions, or judgments, fines, or settlements involving a payment of material sums of money, or if injunctive relief were issued against us, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Even the successful defense of legal proceedings may cause us to incur substantial legal costs and may divert management’s attention and resources. Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could adversely affect our business. Our intellectual property, including our trademarks, service marks, domain names, copyrights, patent and other proprietary rights, constitutes a significant part of our value. To protect our intellectual property rights, we rely upon a combination of trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret and unfair competition laws of the United States and other countries, as well as contract provisions and third-party policies and procedures governing internet/domain name registrations. However, there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful in any given case, particularly in those countries where the laws do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. We may be unable to prevent the misappropriation, infringement or violation of our intellectual property rights, breaching any contractual obligations to us, or independently developing intellectual property that is similar to ours, any of which could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed, adversely affect our revenues or otherwise harm our business. We have obtained and applied for numerous U.S. and foreign trademark and service mark registrations and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks and service marks or other intellectual property, as appropriate. We cannot guarantee that any of our pending applications will be approved by the applicable governmental authorities. Moreover, even if the applications are approved, third parties may seek to oppose or otherwise challenge these registrations. A failure to obtain registrations for our intellectual property in the United States and other countries could limit our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and impede our marketing efforts in those jurisdictions. 28 We are actively engaged in enforcement and other activities to protect our intellectual property rights. If it became necessary for us to resort to litigation to protect these rights, any proceedings could be burdensome, costly and divert the attention of our personnel, and we may not prevail. In addition, any repeal or weakening of laws or enforcement in the United States or internationally intended to protect intellectual property rights could make it more difficult for us to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, negatively impacting their value and increasing the cost of enforcing our rights. We may be subject to claims for infringing the intellectual property rights of others, which could be costly and result in the loss of significant intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that we do not and will not infringe the intellectual property rights of others. We have been in the past, and may be in the future, subject to litigation and other claims in the ordinary course of our business based on allegations of infringement or other violations of the intellectual property rights of others. Regardless of their merits, intellectual property claims can divert the efforts of our personnel and are often time-consuming and expensive to litigate or settle. In addition, to the extent claims against us are successful, we may have to pay substantial money damages or discontinue, modify, or rename certain products or services that are found to be in violation of another party’s rights. We may have to seek a license (if available on acceptable terms, or at all) to continue offering products and services, which may significantly increase our operating expenses. If we lose licenses and permits required to exhibit animals and/or violate laws and regulations, our business will be adversely affected. We are required to hold government licenses and permits, some of which are subject to yearly or periodic renewal, for purposes of possessing, exhibiting, and maintaining animals. Although our theme parks’ licenses and permits have always been renewed in the past, in the event that any of our licenses or permits are not renewed or any of our licenses or permits are revoked, portions of the affected theme park might not be able to remain open for purpose of displaying or retaining the animals covered by such license or permit. Such an outcome could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we are subject to periodic inspections by federal and state agencies and the subsequent issuance of inspection reports. While we believe that we comply with, or exceed, requisite care and maintenance standards that apply to our animals, government inspectors can cite us for alleged statutory or regulatory violations. In unusual instances when we are cited for an alleged deficiency, we are most often given the opportunity to correct any purported deficiencies without penalty. It is possible, however, that in some cases a federal or state regulator could seek to impose monetary fines on us. In the past, when we have been subjected to governmental claims for fines, the amounts involved were not material to our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, while unlikely, we cannot predict whether any future fines that regulators might seek to impose would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Moreover, many of the statutes under which we operate allow for the imposition of criminal sanctions. While neither of the foregoing situations are likely to occur, either could negatively affect the business, financial condition or results of operations at our theme parks. If we lose key personnel, our business may be adversely affected. Our success depends in part upon a number of key employees, including members of our senior management team who have extensive experience in the industry. We may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employees, particularly if we do not offer employment terms that are competitive with the rest of the market. Failure to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified employees, or failure to develop and implement a viable succession plan, could adversely affect our business and our future success. Changes in our management team and to the Board of Directors, may be disruptive to, or cause uncertainty in, our business, and any additional changes to the management team or the Board of Directors could have a negative impact on our ability to manage and grow our business effectively. In addition, if we are not effective in our succession planning, it may have a negative impact on our ability to successfully recruit for our management team. Any such disruption or uncertainty or difficulty in efficiently and effectively filling key manageme nt roles could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and/or the price of our common stock. Unionization activities or labor disputes may disrupt our operations and affect our profitability. Although none of our employees are currently covered under collective bargaining agreements, we cannot guarantee that our employees will not elect to be represented by labor unions in the future. If some or all of our employees were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were significantly different from our current compensation arrangements, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, a labor dispute involving some or all of our employees may disrupt our operations and reduce our revenues, and resolution of disputes may increase our costs. Although we maintain binding policies that require employees to submit to a mandatory alternative dispute resolution procedure in lieu of other remedies, as employers, we may be subject to various employment-related claims, such as individual or class actions or government enforcement actions relating to alleged employment discrimination, employee classification and related withholding, wage-hour, labor standards or healthcare and benefit issues. Such actions, if brought against us and successful in whole or in part, may affect our ability to compete or materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 29 Our business depends on our ability to meet our workforce needs. Our success depends on our ability to attract, train, motivate and retain qualified employees to keep pace with our needs, including employees with certain specialized skills in the field of animal training and care. If we are unable to do so, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected. In addition, we employ a significant seasonal workforce. We recruit year-round to fill thousands of seasonal staffing positions each season and work to manage seasonal wages and the timing of the hiring process to ensure the appropriate workforce is in place. There is no assurance that we will be able to recruit and hire adequate seasonal personnel as the business requires or that we will not experience material increases in the cost of securing our seasonal workforce in the future. Increased seasonal wages or an inadequate workforce could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. See also, “ Increased labor costs and employee health and welfare benefits may negatively impact our operations.” We may not realize the benefits of developments, restructurings, acquisitions or other strategic initiatives and we may incur significant costs associated with such activities. Our business strategy may include selective expansion, both domestically and internationally, through acquisitions of assets or other strategic initiatives, such as joint ventures, that allow us to profitably expand our business and leverage our brands. For example, in 2016 we announced our partnership with Miral Asset Management LLC to develop SeaWorld Abu Dhabi, a first-of-its-kind marine life themed park on Yas Island. There is no assurance that the Miral partnership or our other strategic initiatives will be successful. In addition, on March 24, 2017, we entered into a Park Exclusivity and Concept Design Agreement and a Center Concept & Preliminary Design Support Agreement with an affiliate of ZHG Group to provide design, support and advisory services for various potential projects and granting exclusive rights in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau (collectively, the “ZHG Agreements”). The ZHG Agreements were terminated in April 2019 as a result of the contract party’s defaulting on the payment of required amounts under these agreements. Any international transactions and partnerships are subject to additional risks, including foreign and U.S. regulations on the import and export of animals, the impact of economic fluctuations in economies outside of the United States, difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations due to distance, language and cultural differences, as well as political instability and lesser degree of legal protection in certain jurisdictions, currency exchange fluctuations and potentially adverse tax consequences of overseas operations. In addition, the success of any acquisition depends on effective integration of acquired businesses and assets into our operations, which is subject to risks and uncertainties, including realization of anticipated synergies and cost savings, the ability to retain and attract personnel, the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns, and undisclosed or potential legal liabilities of acquired businesses or assets. We are executing on a strategic plan to grow revenue and Adjusted EBITDA and, from time to time, identify and execute on cost reduction opportunities and take other actions designed to achieve operational efficiencies and process improvements. There is no assurance that we will be able to achieve and/or sustain the cost savings, grow our business, realize or sustain operational efficiencies or achieve other benefits that we may initially expect. In addition, such actions may result in various one-time costs and temporary operational inefficiencies and could negatively impact business and employment relationships during transitional periods. See further discussion under the caption “ Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations―Principal Factors and Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations―Costs and Expenses ” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If we are unable to maintain certain commercial licenses, our business, reputation and brand could be adversely affected. We rely on a license from Sesame to use the Sesame Place trade name and trademark and certain other intellectual property rights, including titles, marks, characters, logos and designs from the Sesame Street television series within our Sesame Place theme park located in Langhorne, Pennsylvania (the “Langhorne Sesame Place”), the Sesame Place theme park we announced that will be opened in California and any additional future Sesame Place theme parks in the United States (collectively, the “Standalone Parks”) and with respect to Sesame Street themed areas within certain areas of some of our other theme parks, as well as in connection with the sales of certain Sesame Street themed products. The License Agreement with Sesame Workshop (the “Sesame License Agreement”) has an initial term through December 31, 2031, with an automatic additional 15-year extension plus a 5-year option added from each new Standalone Park opening. Our use of these intellectual property rights is subject to the approval of Sesame and the parties have certain termination rights under the Sesame License Agreement, including without limitation Sesame’s right to terminate the Sesame License Agreement in whole or in part under certain limited circumstances, including a change of control of SeaWorld (or of SeaWorld Parks and Entertainment, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of SeaWorld), our bankruptcy or uncured breach of the Sesame License Agreement, or the termination of the Sesame License Agreement regarding the Langhorne Sesame Place theme park. If we were to lose or have to renegotiate the Sesame License Agreement, our business may be adversely affected. 30 ABI is the owner of the Busch Gardens trademarks and domain names. ABI has granted us a perpetual, exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use the Busch Gardens trademark and certain related domain names in connection with the operation, marketing, promotion and advertising of certain of our theme parks, as well as in connection with the production, use, distribution and sale of merchandise sold in connection with such theme parks. Under the license, we are required to indemnify ABI against losses related to our use of the marks. If we were to lose or have to renegotiate this license, our business may be adversely affected. Our existing debt agreements contain, and future debt agreements may contain, restrictions that may limit our flexibility in operating our business. Our existing debt agreements contain, and documents governing our future indebtedness may contain, financial and operating covenants that limit the discretion of management with respect to certain business matters. These covenants place restrictions on, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends and other distributions, make capital expenditures, make certain loans, investments and other restricted payments, enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends, engage in certain transactions with stockholders or affiliates, sell certain assets or engage in mergers, acquisitions and other business combinations, amend or otherwise alter the terms of our indebtedness, alter the business that we conduct, guarantee indebtedness or incur other contingent obligations and create liens. Our existing debt agreements also require, and documents governing our future indebtedness may require, us to meet certain financial ratios and tests. Our ability to comply with these and other provisions of the existing debt agreements is dependent on our future performance, which will be subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control. The breach of any of these covenants or non-compliance with any of these financial ratios and tests could result in an event of default under the existing debt agreements, which, if not cured or waived, could result in acceleration of the related debt and the acceleration of debt under other instruments evidencing indebtedness that may contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions. We discuss certain key covenants and financial ratios to which we are subject under our debt agreements in greater detail under the caption “Restrictive Covenants” in Note 11–Long-Term Debt to our accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and under “ Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations―Our Indebtedness―Covenant Compliance ”. Additionally, variable rate indebtedness subjects us to the risk of higher interest rates, which could cause our future debt service obligations to increase significantly. Changes to, or the elimination of, LIBOR may adversely affect interest expense related to our indebtedness. Borrowings under our Term B-5 Loans which mature on March 31, 2024, and the Revolving Credit Facility which matures on October 31, 2023 are currently based on LIBOR. In July 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), a regulator of financial services firms and financial markets in the United Kingdom, stated that it will plan for a phase out of regulatory oversight of LIBOR interest rates indices. The FCA has indicated it will support the LIBOR indices through 2021, to allow for an orderly transition to an alternative reference rate. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate any credit agreements or any hedge transactions extending beyond 2021 that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established. Also, if we intend to hedge our LIBOR denominated debt, we cannot predict whether hedging opportunities will exist on acceptable terms. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee, which was charged with determining a replacement for LIBOR, has proposed the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), as its recommended alternative to LIBOR. Subsequent to that recommendation, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2018-16, Derivatives and Hedging which includes SOFR as a permitted rates that can be used in the application of hedge accounting pursuant to adoption of the standard (see Note–3 Recent Accounting Pronouncements to our accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual report on Form 10-K for further discussion). The Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing SOFR rates in April 2018. SOFR is intended to be a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities. The market transition away from LIBOR is expected to be gradual and complicated, and to include the development of term and credit adjustments to accommodate differences between LIBOR and SOFR. There can be no guarantee that SOFR will become widely used or that alternatives may be developed without additional complications. We are not able to predict whether LIBOR will cease to be available after 2021, whether SOFR will become a widely accepted benchmark in place of LIBOR, or what the impact of such a possible transition from LIBOR may be on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds, related margins, liquidity, and access to capital markets. Moody’s Investor Service and Standard & Poor’s Financial Services routinely evaluate our debt and issue ratings on our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. These ratings are based on a number of factors, which included their assessment of our financial strength, liquidity, capital structure, asset quality, and sustainability of cash flow and earnings. Due to changes in these factors, the pandemic and market conditions, we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings, which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins, liquidity and access to capital markets. 31 For example, as of December 31, 20 20 , our Senior Secured Credit Facilities were rated by Standard and Poor’s Financial Services (corporate credit rated B - with a negative outlook and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities rated B - ) and Moody’s Investors Service (corporate family rated B 3 with a negative outlook and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities rated B2). We disclose these ratings to enhance the understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effects of these ratings on our costs of funds and related margins, liquidity and access to capital markets. Our borrowing costs depend, in part, on our credit ratings and any actions taken by these credit rating agencies to lower our credit ratings , could increase our borrowing costs. Our leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness. As of December 31, 2020, our total indebtedness was approximately $2.220 billion. Our high degree of leverage could have important consequences, including the following: (i) a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations is dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available for operations, capital expenditures, future business opportunities and/or share repurchases of our common stock; (ii) our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate purposes in the future may be limited; (iii) certain of the borrowings are at variable rates of interest, which will increase our vulnerability to increases in interest rates; (iv) we are at a competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors; (v) we may be unable to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions; (vi) the debt service requirements of our other indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations; and (vii) we may be vulnerable in a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business and we may be unable to carry out activities that are important to our growth. We do not currently have any of our debt hedged. A hypothetical increase in LIBOR of 100 bps would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $5.9 million. Increased debt service costs would adversely affect our cash flow and net income. There can be no assurance that if we intend to enter into a hedge, that we will be able to enter into hedging arrangements on favorable terms or at all. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, or to pay interest on, or to refinance indebtedness depends on and is subject to our financial and operating performance, which in turn is affected by general and regional economic, financial, competitive, business and other factors beyond our control, including the availability of financing in the banking and capital markets. If unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs, we will need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity. There can be no assurance that any refinancing of our indebtedness will be possible and any such refinancing could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants that could further restrict our business operations. We from time to time may increase the amount of our indebtedness, modify the terms of our financing arrangements, make capital expenditures, issue dividends and take other actions that may substantially increase our leverage. Despite our significant leverage, we may incur additional amounts of debt, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our significant leverage. Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that we could suffer, and our insurance costs may increase. Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that we could suffer, and our insurance costs may increase. Although we maintain various safety and loss prevention programs and carry property and casualty insurance to cover certain risks, our insurance policies do not cover all types of losses and liabilities. Additionally, many of our policies are subject to deductibles and/or self-insured retentions and co-insurance. There can be no assurance our insurance will be sufficient to cover the full extent of all losses or liabilities for which we are insured and may be significantly less than the expected and actual replacement cost of rebuilding facilities “as was” if there was a total loss. For example, we expect the majority of losses related to impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will not be covered by insurance available to us and insurers may contest coverage. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew our current insurance policies on favorable terms, or at all. In addition, if we or other theme park operators sustain significant losses or make significant insurance claims, then our ability to obtain future insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates could be materially adversely affected. 32 We may be unable to purchase or contract with third-party manufacturers for our theme park rides and attractions, or construction delays may occur and impact attraction openings . We may be unable to purchase or contract with third parties to build high quality rides and attractions and to continue to service and maintain those rides and attractions at competitive or beneficial prices, or to provide the replacement parts needed to maintain the operation of such rides. In addition, if our third-party suppliers’ financial condition deteriorates or they go out of business, we may not be able to obtain the full benefit of manufacturer warranties or indemnities typically contained in our contracts or may need to incur greater costs for the maintenance, repair, replacement or insurance of these assets. We may also incur unanticipated construction delays in completing capital projects which could adversely affect ride or attraction opening dates which could impact our attendance or revenues. Further, when rides and/or attractions have downtime and/or closures, our attendance or revenue could be adversely affected. Our operations and our ownership of property subject us to environmental requirements, and to environmental expenditures and liabilities. We incur costs to comply with environmental requirements, such as those relating to water use, wastewater and storm water management and disposal, air emissions control, hazardous materials management, solid and hazardous waste disposal, and the clean-up of properties affected by regulated materials. We have been required and continue to investigate and clean-up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases, and other releases, from current or formerly owned or operated facilities. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we generate, use and dispose of large volumes of water, including saltwater, which requires us to comply with a number of federal, state and local regulations and to incur significant expenses. Failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to fines and penalties and/or require us to incur additional expenses. Although we are not now classified as a large quantity generator of hazardous waste, we do store and handle hazardous materials to operate and maintain our equipment and facilities and have done so historically. We cannot assure you that we will not incur substantial costs to comply with new or expanded environmental requirements in the future or to investigate or clean-up new or newly identified environmental conditions, which could also impair our ability to use or transfer the affected properties and to obtain financing. Delays, restrictions, or inability to obtain or maintain permits for capital investments could impair our business. Our capital investments require regulatory permits from one or more governmental agencies in order to improve existing or build new theme parks, rides, attractions and shows. Such permits are typically issued by state agencies, but federal and local governmental permits may also be required. The requirements for such permits vary depending on the location of such capital investments. As with all governmental permitting processes, there is a degree of uncertainty as to whether a permit will be granted, the time it will take for a permit to be issued, and the conditions that may be imposed in connection with the granting of the permit. Therefore, our capital investments in certain areas may be delayed, interrupted, or suspended for varying lengths of time, causing a loss of revenue to us, increasing cost, and/or adversely affecting our results of operations. Financial distress experienced by our strategic partners or other counterparties could have an adverse impact on us. We are party to numerous contracts of varying durations. Certain of our agreements are comprised of a mixture of firm and non-firm commitments, varying tenures, and varying renewal terms, among other terms. There can be no guarantee that, upon the expiration of our contracts, we will be able to renew such contracts on terms as favorable to us, or at all. Although we attempt to assess the creditworthiness of our strategic partners and other contract counterparties, there can be no assurance as to the creditworthiness of any such strategic partner or contract counterparty. Financial distress experienced by our strategic partners or other counterparties could have an adverse impact in the event such parties are unable to pay us for the services we provide or otherwise fulfill their contractual obligations. We are exposed to the risk of loss in the event of non-performance by such strategic partners or other counterparties. Some of these counterparties may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating, market and regulatory risks, and some are experiencing, or may experience in the future, severe financial problems that have had or may have a significant impact on their creditworthiness. For example, we terminated the ZHG Agreements for non-payment of undisputed amounts owed. In addition, the sale or transfer of our common stock owned by affiliates of Hill Path, or the perception that such sales or transfers could occur, could harm the prevailing market price of shares of our common stock. Any material nonpayment or nonperformance from our contract counterparties due to inability or unwillingness to perform or adhere to contractual arrangements could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to make cash distributions to its stockholders. Furthermore, in the case of financially distressed strategic partners, such events might otherwise force such strategic partners to curtail their commercial relationships with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. 33 Goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets represent a significant portion of our total assets, and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets. Our operations are capital intensive and require significant investment in long-lived assets, such as property, equipment and other long-lived assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant portion of our assets. We review goodwill and intangible assets at least annually for impairment. Impairment may result from, among other things, deterioration in park performance, adverse competitive conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations, including changes that restrict our activities or affect the services we offer, challenges to the validity of our intellectual property and a variety of other factors. For example, in 2017 due to financial performance at the time at our SeaWorld Orlando park, we determined a triggering event had occurred that required an interim goodwill impairment test. Based on the results of the interim goodwill impairment test, we concluded that the goodwill for the SeaWorld Orlando reporting unit was fully impaired which resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of $269.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. There is no assurance that we will not experience similar asset impairments in the future. Any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets would result in a non-cash charge against earnings, which would adversely affect our results of operations. Changes to tax laws may result in a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial condition. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), was enacted on December 22, 2017, and contains a number of changes to U.S. federal tax laws. The Tax Act requires complex computations that were not previously provided for under U.S. tax law and significantly revised the U.S. tax code by, among other changes, lowering the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and imposing limitations on the deductibility of interest. Additional guidance may be issued by the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, the Department of the Treasury, or other governing body that may significantly differ from our interpretation of the law, which may result in a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial conditions . Tariffs or other trade restrictions could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We purchase some of our merchandise for resale and other products used in our business from entities which are located in foreign countries. Additionally, some of our ride manufacturers may be located in foreign countries or utilize components manufactured or sourced from foreign countries. These relationships expose us to risks associated with doing business globally, including changes in tariffs, quotas and other restrictions on imports (collectively, “Trade Restrictions”). The United States has increased tariffs on certain imports from China and other countries. While the current tariffs have not had a material impact on goods that we currently either import from China or purchase from domestic vendors which import from China, we cannot predict how any future tariffs or any other Trade Restrictions will impact our business. Such Trade Restrictions would likely result in lower gross margin on impacted products or increase the cost of capital projects, unless we are able to take successfully any one or more of the following mitigating actions: increase our prices, move production to countries with no or lower tariffs or away from domestic vendors who source from China or other tariff impacted countries, or alter or cease offering certain products. Any increase in pricing, alteration of products or reduced product offering could reduce the competitiveness of our products. Furthermore, any retaliatory counter-measures imposed by countries subject to such tariffs, could increase our, or our vendors’, import expenses. Additionally, even if the products we import are not directly impacted by tariffs, the imposition and maintenance of such tariffs on goods imported into the United States could cause increased prices for consumer goods, in general, which could have a negative impact on consumer spending for discretionary items reducing attendance or spending at our parks. These direct and indirect impacts of increased tariffs or Trade Restrictions implemented by the United States, both individually and cumulatively, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of future operations. Actions of activist stockholders, and such activism could adversely impact the value of our securities. We value constructive input from our stockholders and the investment community. Our Board and management team are committed to acting in the best interests of all of our stockholders. There is no assurance that the actions taken by our Board of Directors and management in seeking to maintain constructive engagement with our stockholders will be successful. Responding to actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management and our employees. Such activities could also interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plan and our long-term growth. The perceived uncertainties as to our future direction caused by activist actions could affect the market price of our securities, result in the loss of potential business opportunities and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, board members and business partners. In addition, any interference with our annual meeting process, including but not limited to a proxy contest for the election of directors at our annual meeting, could require us to incur significant legal and other advisory fees and proxy solicitation expenses and require significant time and attention by management and our Board. 34 Affiliates of Hill Path Capital LP could be able to significantly influence our decisions and their interests may conflict with ours or yours in the future. In 2019, Hill Path Capital LP and certain of its affiliates (“Hill Path”) purchased in the aggregate, 13,214,000 shares of our common stock (the “HP Purchase”). As described more fully in our Form 8-K dated May 27, 2019, we concurrently entered into the Stockholders Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement and the Undertaking Agreement (collectively, the “HP Agreements”) with Hill Path in connection with the HP Purchase. On July 2, 2020, Hill Path filed with the SEC a Schedule 13D/A (the “Schedule 13D/A”) reporting that such persons had accumulated a total of 27,205,306 shares of our common stock, which represents approximately 34.7% of our total outstanding shares of common stock as of December 31, 2020. Also, certain funds affiliated with Hill Path have other economic interests in the Company. Please refer to their most recent Schedule 13D/A. In addition, the Hill Path Schedule 13D filed on May 1, 2017, as amended states, among other things, that Hill Path may suggest changes in our business, operations, capital structure, capital allocation, corporate governance, and other strategic matters. Under the HP Agreements, we agreed to appoint up to three Hill Path director designees (“Hill Path Designees”) to our Board of Directors of which two directors may be affiliated with Hill Path and, subject to the independence standards of the New York Stock Exchange, there shall be one Hill Path Designee on each committee of the Board, as determined by Hill Path and subject to the approval of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Scott Ross, founder of Hill Path, James Chambers, a Partner at Hill Path, and Charles Koppelman, who is independent, are the Hill Path Designees. Mr. Ross currently serves as Chairman of the Board and Chairman of the Compensation Committee and also serves on the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Revenue Committee. Mr. Chambers serves as Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and also serves on the Compensation Committee and the Revenue Committee. Mr. Koppelman serves on the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Revenue Committee. For so long as Hill Path Designees remain on our Board, Hill Path will have influence with respect to our management, business plans and policies, including the appointment and removal of our officers, and nominees for director. In addition, for so long as Hill Path continues to own a significant percentage of our stock, Hill Path will be able to influence the composition of our Board of Directors and the approval of actions requiring stockholder approval. For example, for so long as Hill Path continues to own a significant percentage of our stock, Hill Path may be able to influence whether or not a change of control of our Company or a change in the composition of our Board of Directors occurs. The concentration of ownership could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of common stock as part of a sale of our Company and ultimately might affect the market price of our common stock. The policies of the recently elected U.S. President and his administration or any changes to tax laws may result in a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial condition and may impact our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards. While the new administration’s policies in many areas are uncertain at this time, certain types of policies regarding increases in minimum wage, foreign travel to the United States, foreign trade, domestic travel, changes to labor laws or regulations, manufacturing, development, investment and environment or animal welfare matters could adversely affect our business. Additionally, policies that strengthen the U.S. dollar against a variety of foreign currencies could impact international tourist spending, including at our theme parks. While there is currently a substantial lack of clarity and uncertainty around the likelihood, timing and details of any such policies and reforms, such policies and reforms may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the value of our securities. For example, a proposed corporate tax bill includes, among other changes, an increase in the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28% and a minimum tax of 15% on book net income for corporations with $100 million or higher in book profits. The President signed an Executive Order with the goal of increasing the minimum wage for federal workers and contractors to $15.00 an hour. Additionally, the new administration is encouraging Congress to increase the federal minimum wage to $15.00 an hour. Separately, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), which was enacted on December 22, 2017, contained a number of changes to U.S. federal tax laws. The Tax Act, among other changes, imposed limitations on the deductibility of interest, limited the use of net operating loss carryforwards arising in periods after 2017, and extended the expiration period for net operating losses from 20 years to an unlimited period. Additionally, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) temporarily revised the U.S. tax code by, among other changes, deferring the 2020 employer portion of social security payments, implementing an employee retention credit, and allowing for 100% utilization of net operating loss carryforwards against 2020 taxable income. On December 28, 2020, a second stimulus bill was enacted which enhanced the CARES Act by, among other changes, extending the employee retention credit, extending the work opportunity credit, and allowing for 100% deduction for certain business meals through the year 2022. Additional guidance may be issued by the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, the Department of the Treasury, or other governing body that may significantly differ from our interpretation of the law, which may result in a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial conditions . 35 W e continue to monitor changes and proposed changes to tax and other laws that may impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition and liquidity . I t is currently unclear how the agenda of the new administration will impact our business . It is also uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the CARES Act. As a result , we may not be able to utilize our existing net operating losses or any portion thereof in the current tax year or any available carryforward period. Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock Our stock price may change significantly, and you may not be able to sell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid or at all, and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result. The trading price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile. Since shares of our common stock were sold in our IPO in April 2013 through December 31, 2020, our common stock close price has ranged from $7.46 to $38.92. In addition to the risk factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the trading price of our common stock may be adversely affected due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: • results of operations that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors; • results of operations that vary from those of our competitors; • changes in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates and investment recommendations by securities analysts and investors; • declines in the market prices of stocks generally, or those of amusement and theme parks companies; • strategic actions by us or our competitors; • announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, new products, acquisitions, joint marketing relationships, joint ventures, other strategic relationships or capital commitments; • changes in general economic or market conditions or trends in our industry or markets; • changes in business or regulatory conditions; • future sales of our common stock or other securities; • repurchases of our common stock; • investor perceptions or the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment alternatives; • the public’s response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the SEC; • rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry, particularly with respect to strategic transactions; • announcements relating to litigation; • guidance, if any, that we provide to the public, any changes in this guidance or our failure to meet this guidance; • the development and sustainability of an active trading market for our stock; • actions by institutional or activist stockholders; • changes in accounting principles; and • other events or factors, including those resulting from pandemics, natural disasters, war, acts of terrorism or responses to these events. We cannot guarantee that our allocation of capital to various alternatives will enhance long-term stockholder value, and in some cases, our Share Repurchase Program could increase the volatility of the price of our common stock. Our goal is to invest capital to maximize our overall long-term returns. This includes spending on capital projects and expenses, managing debt levels, and periodically returning capital to our stockholders through share repurchases and dividends. There can be no assurance that our capital allocation decisions will enhance stockholder value. Our Board has previously authorized a share repurchase of up to $250.0 million of our common stock (the “Share Repurchase Program”), of which approximately $237.6 million remains available under the Share Repurchase Program as of December 31, 2020. The number of shares to be purchased and the timing of purchases will be based on our trading windows and available liquidity, general business and market conditions and other factors, including legal requirements and alternative opportunities. In connection with Amendment No. 12 to our Amended Credit Agreement, we are restricted from paying any dividends or making restricted payments, including share repurchases, through the third quarter of 2022 unless certain conditions are met. 36 During 2020, prior to the COVID-19 temporary park closures, we completed a share repurchase of 469,785 shares for an aggregate total of approximately $12.4 million. Repurchases of our common stock pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. The existence of the Share Repurchase Program could cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. There can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock. Although the Share Repurchase Program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, there is no assurance that it will do so and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce such program’s effectiveness. Future sales, or the perception of future sales, by us or our existing stockholders in the public market could cause the market price for our common stock to decline. The sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could harm the prevailing market price of shares of our common stock. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. Shares held by Hill Path and certain of our directors, officers and employees are eligible for resale, subject to volume, manner of sale and other limitations under Rule 144. In addition, pursuant to a registration rights agreement entered into in connection with the HP Purchase, we granted Hill Path the right, subject to certain conditions, to require us to register the sale of their shares of common stock under the Securities Act. If Hill Path exercises their registration rights, the market price of our shares of common stock could drop significantly. This factor could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through future offerings of our shares of common stock or other securities. In addition, the shares of our common stock reserved for future issuance under the 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan will become eligible for sale in the public market once those shares are issued, subject to provisions relating to various vesting agreements, any applicable lock-up agreements in effect from time to time and Rule 144, as applicable. A total of 15,000,000 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under the 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan, of which approximately 7,680,000 shares of common stock remain available for future issuance as of December 31, 2020. In the future, we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions. The number of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of our common stock. Any issuance of additional securities in connection with investments or acquisitions may result in additional dilution to you. Our indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock in the future. We have not paid a dividend since September 2016. Dividends, if any, and the timing of declaration of any such dividends, will be at the discretion of the Board and will depend upon many factors, including, but not limited to, our results of operations, financial condition, level of indebtedness, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, restrictions in our debt agreements and in any preferred stock, business prospects and other factors that the Board deems relevant. Our ability to declare dividends and make other restricted payments is limited by covenants in our senior secured credit facilities pursuant to a credit agreement dated as of December 1, 2009, as the same may be amended, restated, supplemented or modified from time to time (the “Senior Secured Credit Facilities”). In connection with Amendment No. 12 to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, we are restricted from paying any dividends or making restricted payments, including share repurchases, through the third quarter of 2022 unless certain conditions are met. See Note 11–Long-Term Debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 37 Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control. Certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, defer or prevent a merger, acquisition, tender offer, takeover attempt or other change of control transaction that a stockholder might consider in its best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by our stockholders. These provisions provide for, among other things: • the ability of our Board of Directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock; • advance notice for nominations of directors by stockholders and for stockholders to include matters to be considered at our annual meetings; • certain limitations on convening special stockholder meetings; • the removal of directors with or without cause only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66.67% in voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of our stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class; and • that certain provisions may be amended only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66.67% in voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of our stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class. These anti-takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if the third-party’s offer may be considered beneficial by many of our stockholders. As a result, our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares. The concentration of ownership of our capital stock limits your ability to influence corporate matters. Our executive officers, directors, current 5% or greater stockholders and entities affiliated with them beneficially owned (as determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC) approximately 62.4% of our common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2020. This significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with controlling stockholders. Also, these stockholders, acting together, may be able to control our management and affairs and matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions, such as mergers, consolidations or the sale of substantially all of our assets. Consequently, this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, including a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control, even if that change of control would benefit our other stockholders. Non-U.S. holders who own or owned more than a certain ownership threshold may be subject to United States federal income tax on gains realized on the disposition of our common stock. We believe that we are currently a U.S. real property holding corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. So long as our common stock continues to be regularly traded on an established securities market, a non-U.S. stockholder who holds or held (at any time during the shorter of the five-year period preceding the date of disposition or the holder’s holding period) more than 5% of our common stock will be subject to United States federal income tax on the disposition of our common stock. Non-U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the consequences of disposing of shares of our common stock. 38 Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 2. Properties The following table summarizes our principal properties as of December 31, 2020, which includes approximately 400 acres of land available for future development. Location Size Use San Diego, CA 190 acres (a) Leased Land Chula Vista, CA 66 acres Owned Water Park (b) Orlando, FL 279 acres Owned Theme Park and Corporate Headquarters Orlando, FL 58 acres Owned All-inclusive Interactive Park Orlando, FL 81 acres Owned Water Park Tampa, FL 56 acres Owned Water Park Tampa, FL 306 acres Owned Theme Park Dade City, FL 109 acres Owned Breeding and Holding Facility Langhorne, PA 55 acres Owned Theme Park San Antonio, TX 397 acres Owned Theme Park San Antonio, TX 18 acres Owned Water Park Williamsburg, VA 222 acres Owned Water Park Williamsburg, VA 422 acres Owned Theme Park Williamsburg, VA 5 acres Owned Warehouse Space Williamsburg, VA 5 acres Owned Seasonal Worker Lodging (a) Includes approximately 17 acres of water in Mission Bay Park, California. (b) Expected to be converted to Sesame Place in 2022. We believe that our properties are in good operating condition and adequately serve our current business operations. Lease Agreement with City of San Diego Our subsidiary, Sea World LLC (f/k/a Sea World Inc.), leases approximately 190 acres from the City of San Diego, including approximately 17 acres of water in Mission Bay Park, California (the “Premises”). The current lease term commenced on July 1, 1998 and extends for 50 years or the maximum period allowed by law. Under the lease, the Premises must be used as a marine park facility and related uses. In addition, we may not operate another marine park facility within a radius of 560 miles from the City of San Diego. The annual rent under the lease is calculated on the basis of a specified percentage of Sea World LLC’s gross income from the Premises (the “Percentage Rent”), or the minimum yearly rent (the “Minimum Rent”), whichever is greater. The minimum yearly rent is adjusted every three years to an amount equal to 80% of the average accounting year rent actually paid for the three previous years. The current minimum yearly rent is approximately $10.4 million, which is subject to adjustment on January 1, 2023. The Company’s gross income from the Premises was significantly impacted during the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the temporary park closures, limited reopenings, modified operations and capacity restrictions resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related government restrictions in San Diego. As a result, the Company deferred approximately $1.6 million of the Percentage Rent related to the year ended December 31, 2020, which was subsequently paid during the first quarter of 2021. The Company continues to defer an additional $8.3 million related to the Minimum Rent for the year ended December 31, 2020.

(2) Our Board of Directors previously authorized a share repurchase program of up to $250.0 million of our common stock (the “Share Repurchase Program”). Under the Share Repurchase Program, we are authorized to repurchase shares through open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans and under Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. Through December 31, 2020, prior to the COVID-19 temporary park closures, we repurchased an aggregate total of approximately $12.4 million, leaving approximately $237.6 million available under the Share Repurchase Program as of December 31, 2020. All of the common stock is held as treasury shares as of December 31, 2020. In connection with Amendment No. 12 to our Amended Credit Agreement, we are restricted from making restricted payments, including share repurchases, through the third quarter of 2022 unless certain conditions are met.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations References to our “theme parks” or “parks” in the discussion that follows includes all of our separately gated parks. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those described in the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

Business Overview We are a leading theme park and entertainment company providing experiences that matter and inspiring guests to protect animals and the wild wonders of our world. We own or license a portfolio of recognized brands, including SeaWorld, Busch Gardens, Aquatica, Discovery Cove and Sesame Place. Over our more than 60-year history, we have developed a diversified portfolio of 12 differentiated theme parks that are grouped in key markets across the United States. Many of our theme parks showcase our one-of-a-kind zoological collection and feature a diverse array of both thrill and family-friendly rides, educational presentations, shows and/or other attractions with broad demographic appeal which deliver memorable experiences and a strong value proposition for our guests. Recent Developments Impact of Global COVID-19 Pandemic Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, we have taken proactive measures for the safety of our guests, employees and animals, to manage costs and expenditures, and to provide liquidity. See further discussion concerning the proactive measures we have taken in the “ Business ” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and in compliance with government restrictions, we temporarily closed all of our theme parks effective March 16, 2020. Beginning in June 2020, we began the phased reopening of some of our parks with capacity limitations and modified/limited operations. See further discussion relating to the parks we have reopened in the “Business” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have implemented enhanced health and safety protocols for our parks including capacity limitations, increased cleaning and sanitizing, physical distancing practices, face covering requirements and temperature screening of both guests and employees. Additionally, we introduced an online reservation system to help manage capacity and we are managing the number of operating days and operating hours by park to optimize cash flow. We also continue our focus on cost reduction initiatives and have identified and executed on additional cost efficiencies which we have implemented, including optimizing labor through more efficient staffing . Attendance since our parks reopened has been impacted by capacity limitations, modified/limited operations, reduced hours and/or reduced operating days, limited marketing spend and a limited events line-up. Despite these limitations, attendance on a 43 consolidated basis , which includes all open and closed parks, improved throughout the second half of 2020 with quarterly attendance down 81% in the third quarter and down 53% in the fourth quarter, versus the comparable prior year period . Excluding our Virginia and California parks which were partially open and operating with modified and significantly limited operations due to state imposed restrictions, attendance trends for open parks also improved throughout the second half of 2020 with quarterly attendance down 70% in the third quarter and down 44% in the fourth quarter versus the comparable prior year period. For other factors concerning the COVID-19 pandemic, see the “ Business” and “ Risk Factors ” sections included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Regulatory Developments See the discussion of relevant regulatory developments under “ Recent Regulatory Developments ” in the “ Business ” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a discussion of certain risks associated with federal and state regulations governing the treatment of animals, see the “ Risk Factors ” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “ Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry—We are subject to complex federal and state regulations governing the treatment of animals, which can change, and to claims and lawsuits by activist groups before government regulators and in the courts. ” Principal Factors and Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations Revenues Our revenues are driven primarily by attendance in our theme parks and the level of per capita spending for admission and per capita spending for culinary, merchandise and other in-park products. We define attendance as the number of guest visits. Attendance drives admissions revenue as well as total in-park spending. Admissions revenue primarily consists of single-day tickets, annual passes (which generally expire after a 12-month term), season passes (including our fun card products and, collectively with annual passes, referred to as “passes” or “season passes”) or other multi-day or multi-park admission products. Revenue from these admissions products are generally recognized based on attendance. Certain pass products are purchased through monthly installment arrangements which allow guests to pay over the product’s initial commitment period. Once the initial commitment period is reached, these products transition to a month to month basis providing these guests access to specific parks on a monthly basis with related revenue recognized monthly when the parks are open. During the period each park was temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which started on March 16, 2020, we did not recognize revenue from the closed park's admission products. Pass and certain pre-purchased revenue products were extended to future dates dependent on the respective park re-opening dates. Pass products purchased through monthly installment arrangements whose initial commitment period ended during the temporary park closures were extended for the respective number of months of closure. Total revenue per capita, defined as total revenue divided by total attendance, consists of admission per capita and in-park per capita spending: • Admission Per Capita. We calculate admission per capita as total admissions revenue divided by total attendance. Admission per capita is primarily driven by ticket pricing, the admissions product mix and the park attendance mix, among other factors. The admissions product mix, also referred to as the attendance or visitation mix, is defined as the mix of attendance by ticket category such as single day, multi-day, annual/season passes or complimentary tickets and can be impacted by the mix of guests as domestic and international guests generally purchase higher admission per capita ticket products than our local guests. A higher mix of complimentary tickets will generally lower our admissions per capita. The park attendance mix is defined as the mix of theme parks visited and can impact admission per capita based on the theme park’s respective pricing which, on average, is lower for our water parks compared to our other theme parks. • In-Park Per Capita Spending. We calculate in-park per capita spending as total food, merchandise and other revenue divided by total attendance. Food, merchandise and other revenue primarily consists of culinary, merchandise, parking and other in-park products and also includes other miscellaneous revenue, including online transaction fees, not necessarily generated in our parks, which is not significant in the periods presented. In-park per capita spending is primarily driven by pricing changes, new product offerings, the mix of guests (such as local, domestic or international guests), penetration levels (percentage of guests purchasing) and the mix of in-park spending, among other factors. See further discussion in the “ Results of Operations ” section which follows. For other factors affecting our revenues, see the “ Risk Factors ” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Attendance The level of attendance in our theme parks is generally a function of many factors, including affordability, the opening of new attractions and shows, competitive offerings, weather, marketing and sales efforts, awareness and type of ticket and park offerings, travel patterns of both our domestic and international guests, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and global and regional economic conditions, consumer confidence, the external perceptions of our brands and reputation, industry best practices and perceptions as to 44 safety. T he external perceptions of our brands and reputation have at times impacted relationships with some of our business partners, including certain ticket resellers that have terminated relationships with us and other zoological-themed attractions. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe the level of attendance in our theme parks, including the mix of attendance from certain markets, has been and will continue to be impacted by public concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of reported local cases of COVID-19, domestic and international travel restrictions, federal, state and local regulations related to public places, limits on social gatherings and overall public safety sentiment. We continuously monitor factors impacting our attendance, making strategic marketing and sales adjustments as necessary. See further discussion in the “ Seasonality ” section which follows. Costs and Expenses Historically, the principal costs of our operations are employee wages and benefits, driven partly by staffing levels, advertising, maintenance, animal care, utilities and insurance. Factors that affect our costs and expenses include fixed operating costs, competitive wage pressures including minimum wage legislation, commodity prices, costs for construction, repairs and maintenance, other inflationary pressures and attendance levels, among other factors. The mix of products sold compared to the prior year period can also impact our costs as generally retail products have a higher cost of sales component than our culinary or other in-park offerings. We continue our focus on reducing costs, improving operating margins and streamlining our labor structure to better align with our strategic business objectives. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have spent significant time reviewing our operations and have identified meaningful cost savings opportunities which we believe will further strengthen our business once we return to normalized operations. During the year ended December 31, 2020, in connection with two previously disclosed legal settlements, we received proceeds of $16.9 million which is included as a reduction to selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded $32.1 million related to a legal settlement charge, net of insurance recoveries, which is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Note 15–Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we committed to a plan of termination (the “2020 Restructuring Program”), primarily impacting some of our furloughed employees. We recorded approximately $2.8 million of severance and other separation costs during the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily related to the 2020 Restructuring Program. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded approximately $4.2 million in pre-tax charges primarily consisting of severance and other termination benefits for positions eliminated in 2019, which is included in severance and other separation costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Note 21–Severance and Other Separation Costs to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. As a result of the park closures related to the COVID-19 pandemic, costs and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, are not necessarily indicative of costs and expenses for any future period. Due in part to the impact of fixed operating costs and certain other costs which are not dependent on attendance levels, operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2020 increased as a percent of revenue when compared to the prior year period. See the “ Impact of Global COVID-19 Pandemic ” section for further details. For other factors affecting our costs and expenses, see the “ Risk Factors ” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We make annual investments to support and improve our existing theme park facilities and attractions. Maintaining and improving our theme parks, as well as opening new attractions, is critical to remain competitive, grow revenue, and increase our guests’ length of stay. For further discussion of our new and planned attractions, see “ Capital Improvements ” in the “Business” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Seasonality The theme park industry is seasonal in nature. Historically, we generate the highest revenues in the second and third quarters of each year, in part because seven of our theme parks are typically only open for a portion of the year. Approximately two-thirds of our attendance and revenues are typically generated in the second and third quarters of the year and we generally incur a net loss in the first and fourth quarters. The percent mix of revenues by quarter is relatively constant each year, but revenues can shift between the first and second quarters due to the timing of Easter and spring break holidays and between the first and fourth quarters due to the timing of holiday breaks around Christmas and New Year. Even for our five theme parks which have historically been open year-round, attendance patterns have significant seasonality, driven by holidays, school vacations and weather conditions. Changes in school calendars that impact traditional school vacation breaks could also impact attendance patterns. Due in part to the temporary park closures, capacity limitations and modified/limited operations, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the seasonality of our business for 2020 and it is difficult to estimate how the COVID-19 pandemic will impact seasonality in the future. Furthermore, any 45 changes to the operating schedule of a park such as increasing operating days for our seasonal parks, could change the impact of seasonality in the future. See “ Risk Factors” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial performance. Results of Operations The following discussion provides an analysis of our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic has materially impacted our revenue and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. See “ Attendance ” and “ Risk Factors ” for further discussion of the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 The following data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following table presents key operating and financial information for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019: For the Year Ended December 31, Variance 2020 2019 $ % Selected Statements of Comprehensive (Loss) Income Data: (In thousands, except per capita data and %) Net revenues: Admissions $ 255,376 $ 802,834 $ (547,458 ) (68.2 %) Food, merchandise and other 176,403 595,410 (419,007 ) (70.4 %) Total revenues 431,779 1,398,244 (966,465 ) (69.1 %) Costs and expenses: Cost of food, merchandise and other revenues 36,712 108,953 (72,241 ) (66.3 %) Operating expenses 388,473 649,657 (261,184 ) (40.2 %) Selling, general and administrative expenses 94,885 261,701 (166,816 ) (63.7 %) Severance and other separation costs 2,826 4,176 (1,350 ) (32.3 %) Depreciation and amortization 150,546 160,557 (10,011 ) (6.2 %) Total costs and expenses 673,442 1,185,044 (511,602 ) (43.2 %) Operating (loss) income (241,663 ) 213,200 (454,863 ) NM Other expense, net 276 18 258 NM Interest expense 100,907 84,178 16,729 19.9 % (Loss) income before income taxes (342,846 ) 129,004 (471,850 ) NM (Benefit from) provision for income taxes (30,525 ) 39,528 (70,053 ) NM Net (loss) income $ (312,321 ) $ 89,476 $ (401,797 ) NM Other data: Attendance 6,373 22,624 (16,251 ) (71.8 %) Total revenue per capita $ 67.75 $ 61.80 $ 5.95 9.6 % Admission per capita $ 40.07 $ 35.48 $ 4.59 12.9 % In-park per capita spending $ 27.68 $ 26.32 $ 1.36 5.2 % NM-Not meaningful Admissions revenue . Admissions revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $547.5 million, or 68.2%, to $255.4 million as compared to $802.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decline in admissions revenue was primarily a result of a decrease in attendance of approximately 16.3 million guests, or 71.8%, partially offset by an increase in admission per capita. Attendance declined due to COVID-19 related impacts including temporary park closures, fewer operating days and hours versus the prior year, capacity limitations, modified/limited operations, limited marketing spend and a limited events line-up. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we had 46% less operating days when compared to 2019. Admission per capita increased by 12.9% to $40.07 in 2020 compared to $35.48 in 2019. Admission per capita increased primarily due to the realization of higher prices in our admission products and a favorable park mix, partially offset by the net impact of the attendance mix when compared to the prior year period. 46 Food, merchandise and other revenue . Food, merchandise and other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $419.0 million, or 70.4% to $176.4 million as compared to $595.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 . The decrease largely results from the decline in attendance discussed above, partially offset by an increase in in-park per capita spending. In-park per capita spending increased by 5.2% , to $27.68 in 2020 from $26.32 in 2019 . In-park per capita spending improved primarily due to higher realized prices and fees , enhanced and expanded product offerings, the mix of certain merchandise and food and beverage items , and increased guest spending , partially offset by the impact of attendance mix, including higher pass mix when compared to the prior year period. Costs of food, merchandise and other revenues. Costs of food, merchandise and other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased $72.2 million, or 66.3%, to $36.7 million as compared to $109.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease primarily relates to the decline in attendance and related park closures and limited reopenings. These costs represent 20.8% and 18.3% of related revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase as a percent of related revenue partly relates to a higher mix of retail products sold, which generally have a higher cost of sales component than our culinary or other in park products. Operating expenses . Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $261.2 million, or 40.2% to $388.5 million as compared to $649.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease largely results from a reduction in labor-related costs due primarily to the COVID-19 temporary park closures and limited reopenings and a reduction in other operating costs resulting from limited operating schedules and other cost savings and efficiency initiatives. Due in part to the impact of fixed operating costs and certain other costs which are not dependent on attendance levels, operating expenses as a percent of revenue increased when compared to the prior year period. Selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $166.8 million, or 63.7% to $94.9 million as compared to $261.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease primarily relates to the following: (i) a reduction in marketing related costs due to the COVID-19 temporary park closures and limited reopenings; (ii) a decrease in legal costs primarily related to legal settlement proceeds of approximately $16.9 million recorded in 2020 compared to a legal settlement charge, net of insurance recoveries, of approximately $32.1 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019; (iii) a decline in third-party consulting costs; and (iv) the impact of cost savings and efficiency initiatives, including reduced labor related costs. See Note 15–Commitments in our notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding our legal settlements. Severance and other separation costs. Severance and other separation costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $1.4 million, or 32.3%, to $2.8 million as compared to $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Severance and other termination costs in 2020 primarily relates to the 2020 Restructuring Program . Severance and other termination costs in 2019 primarily relate to positions which were eliminated in 2019. See Note 21–Severance and Other Separation Costs in our notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by $10.0 million, or 6.2% to $150.5 million as compared to $160.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease primarily relates to a decline in new asset additions in 2020 along with the impact of asset retirements and fully depreciated assets. Interest expense. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased $16.7 million, or 19.9% to $100.9 million as compared to $84.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase primarily relates to approximately $32.7 million of additional interest related to the Senior Secured Notes issued in April 2020 and the Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes issued in August 2020, a higher average outstanding balance on our Revolving Credit Facility during the period and the impact of interest rate swap agreements, which expired in May 2020, partially offset by the impact of decreased LIBOR rates. See Note 11 –Long-Term Debt to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the “ Our Indebtedness ” section which follows for further details. (Benefit from) provision for income taxes. Benefit from income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $30.5 million compared to a provision for income taxes of $39.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. Our consolidated effective tax rate was 8.9% for 2020 compared to 30.6% for 2019. The effective tax rate decreased primarily due to a non-cash valuation allowance adjustment on federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, a valuation allowance adjustment on federal tax credits and charitable contributions, changes in state tax rates, and other permanent items including equity-based compensation . See Note 14–Income Taxes in our notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. 47 Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Generally, our principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations, funds from borrowings and existing cash on hand. Our principal uses of cash include the funding of working capital obligations, debt service, investments in theme parks (including capital projects), and could include share repurchases, when permitted. As of December 31, 2020, we had a working capital ratio (defined as current assets divided by current liabilities) of 1.6, due in part to our outstanding cash balance at December 31, 2020. Historically, we typically operating with a working capital ratio less than 1 due to significant deferred revenue balance from revenues paid in advance for our theme park admissions products and high turnover of in-park products that result in limited inventory balances. Our cash flow from operations, along with our revolving credit facilities, have historically allowed us to meet our liquidity needs. Due to the adverse impact of the COVID-19 temporary park closures, which started on March 16, 2020, and the limited reopening with reduced operating days and/or hours and capacity limitations, we generated negative cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020. See the “ Impact of Global COVID-19 Pandemic ” section and the “ Our Indebtedness ” section for further details concerning the proactive measures we have taken to address liquidity in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. For other factors concerning the COVID-19 pandemic, see the “ Business ” and “ Risk Factors ” sections in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As market conditions warrant and subject to our contractual restrictions and liquidity position, we or our affiliates, may from time to time purchase our outstanding equity and/or debt securities, including our outstanding bank loans in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Any such purchases may be funded by incurring new debt, including additional borrowings under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Any new debt may also be secured debt. We may also use available cash on our balance sheet. The amounts involved in any such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. Further, since some of our debt may trade at a discount to the face amount among current or future syndicate members, any such purchases may result in our acquiring and retiring a substantial amount of any particular series, with the attendant reduction in the trading liquidity of any such series. Depending on conditions in the credit and capital markets and other factors, we will, from time to time, consider other financing transactions, the proceeds of which could be used to refinance our indebtedness or for other purposes. Share Repurchases See Note 17–Related Party Transactions and Note 20–Stockholders’ (Deficit) Equity in our notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on the Share Repurchase Program. Other We believe that existing cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet the capital expenditures, debt service obligations, and working capital requirements of our operations for at least the next 12 months. The following table presents a summary of our cash flows (used in) provided by operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 (In thousands) Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities $ (120,729 ) $ 348,416 $ 293,935 Net cash used in investing activities (109,175 ) (195,193 ) (180,029 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 624,204 (147,305 ) (112,896 ) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash $ 394,300 $ 5,918 $ 1,010 Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities was $120.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $348.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities in 2020 was primarily impacted by the decline in revenue due to the temporary park closures and limited park reopenings. Net cash provided by operating activities was $348.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $293.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily impacted by improved operating performance in 2019 when compared to 2018. 48 Cash Flows from Investing Activities Investing activities consist principally of capital investments we make in our theme parks for future attractions and infrastructure. Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted of capital expenditures of $109.2 million largely related to future attractions (see further breakdown of capital expenditures in the table below). Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of $195.2 million. The following table presents detail of our capital expenditures for the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 Capital Expenditures: (Unaudited, in thousands) Core (a) $ 94,671 $ 171,789 Expansion/ROI projects (b) 14,504 23,428 Capital expenditures, total $ 109,175 $ 195,217 (a) Reflects capital expenditures for park rides, attractions and maintenance activities. (b) Reflects capital expenditures for park expansion, new properties, or other revenue and/or expense return on investment (“ROI”) projects. The amount of our capital expenditures may be affected by general economic and financial conditions, among other things, including restrictions imposed by our borrowing arrangements. Historically, we generally expect to fund our capital expenditures through our operating cash flow, which was materially impacted in 2020. See the “ Impact of Global COVID-19 Pandemic ” section for further details regarding proactive measures we have taken starting in March 2020 relating to our capital expenditures including delaying the opening of certain new rides. For 2021, depending on the pace of the recovery from the COVID-19 impacts, we plan on spending between approximately $100 million and $150 million on capital expenditures. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 results primarily from net proceeds from our Senior Notes and our Second-Priority Senior Notes offering of $713.7 million, partially offset by net repayments on our revolving credit facility of $50.0 million, repayments of $15.5 million on our long-term debt, $12.4 million used to repurchase shares early in the first quarter of 2020 and $7.5 million of debt issuance costs paid in connection with the issuance of the Senior Notes and Second-Priority Senior Notes, and as a result of amendments to our Amended Credit Agreement. Net cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 results primarily from $150.0 million used to repurchase shares and repayments of $15.5 million on our long-term debt, partially offset by a net draw on our Revolving Credit Facility of $20.0 million. See Note 11–Long-Term Debt to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. Our Indebtedness We are a holding company and conduct our operations through our subsidiaries, which have incurred or guaranteed indebtedness as described below. As of December 31, 2020, our indebtedness consisted of senior secured credit facilities, first-priority senior secured notes (“Senior Notes”) and second-priority senior secured notes (“Second-Priority Senior Notes”). See discussion which follows and Note 11–Long-Term Debt to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details related to our indebtedness. Senior Secured Credit Facilities SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc. (“SEA”) is the borrower under the senior secured credit facilities, as amended pursuant to a credit agreement (the “Amended Credit Agreement”) dated as of December 1, 2009, as the same may be amended, restated, supplemented or modified from time to time (the “Senior Secured Credit Facilities”). As of December 31, 2020, our Senior Secured Credit Facilities consisted of $1.492 billion in Term B-5 Loans which will mature on March 31, 2024, along with a $332.5 million Revolving Credit Facility, which had no amounts outstanding as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, SEA had approximately $21.2 million of outstanding letters of credit, leaving approximately $311.3 million available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility. See “Covenant Compliance” discussion which follows for information regarding our required quarterly liquidity test which could impact amounts available for borrowing. First-Priority Senior Secured Notes On April 30, 2020, SEA closed on a private offering of $227.5 million aggregate principal amount of 8.750% Senior Notes. 49 Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes On August 5, 2020, SEA closed on a private offering of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9.500% Second-Priority Senior Notes. Net of expenses related to the offering of the Second-Priority Senior Notes and Amendment No. 12 to the Credit Agreement, we used a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the Second-Priority Senior Notes to repay the then outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility of $311.0 million. See Note 11–Long-Term Debt to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details related to our Senior Notes and Second-Priority Senior Secured Notes. Covenant Compliance As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all covenants in the credit agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The Revolving Credit Facility requires that the we comply with a springing maximum first lien secured leverage ratio of 6.25x to be tested as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, solely to the extent that on such date the aggregate amount of funded loans and letters of credit (excluding undrawn letters of credit in an amount not to exceed $30.0 million and cash collateralized letters of credit) under the Revolving Credit Facility exceeds an amount equal to 35% of the then outstanding commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility. Pursuant to Amendment No. 12, among other terms, SEA will be exempt from complying with its first lien secured leverage ratio covenant through the end of 2021, after which SEA will be required to comply with such covenants starting at the first quarter of 2022. For purposes of calculating compliance with such covenant, unless a Triggering Event occurs (as defined in Amendment No. 12), beginning with the first quarter of 2022, to the extent trailing Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in Amendment No. 12) for the second, third or fourth quarters of 2021 would have otherwise been included in the calculation of such covenant, in lieu of using actual Adjusted EBITDA for such periods, Adjusted EBITDA for such applicable periods will be deemed to be Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in Amendment No. 12) for the corresponding quarter of 2019. See Note 11–Long-Term Debt to our consolidated financial statements for further details relating to the calculation beginning in the first quarter of 2022. In addition, SEA will be required to comply with a quarterly minimum liquidity test (defined as unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and available commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility) of not less than $75.0 million until the earlier of September 30, 2022 or the date on which we elect to use actual Adjusted EBITDA for purposes of calculating its financial maintenance covenant. Adjusted EBITDA We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate as it eliminates the effect of certain non-cash and other items not necessarily indicative of a company’s underlying operating performance. The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA provides additional information to investors about the calculation of, and compliance with, certain financial covenants and other relevant metrics in the credit agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Adjusted EBITDA is a material component of these covenants. Adjusted EBITDA as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities is consistent with our reported Adjusted EBITDA. See the “Our Indebtedness-Covenant Compliance” section for further details. We use Adjusted EBITDA in connection with certain components of our executive compensation program. In addition, investors, lenders, financial analysts and rating agencies have historically used EBITDA related measures in our industry, along with other measures, to estimate the value of a company, to make informed investment decisions and to evaluate companies in the industry. Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized term under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for a measure of our financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and is not indicative of income from operations as determined under GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP financial measures have limitations which should be considered before using these measures to evaluate our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA, as presented by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to varying methods of calculation. 50 The following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement, to net (loss) income for the periods indicated. For the Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 (In thousands) Net (loss) income $ (312,321 ) $ 89,476 $ 44,788 (Benefit from) provision for income taxes (30,525 ) 39,528 17,915 Loss on early extinguishment of debt and write-off of discounts and debt issuance costs (a) — — 8,150 Interest expense 100,907 84,178 80,914 Depreciation and amortization 150,546 160,557 160,955 Equity-based compensation expense (b) 7,467 11,106 22,152 Loss on impairment or disposal of assets and certain non-cash expenses (c) 7,187 3,198 18,862 Business optimization, development and strategic initiative costs (d) 7,268 27,869 29,460 Certain investment costs and other taxes (e) 1,044 5,056 3,353 Other adjusting items (f) (4,759 ) 35,954 14,730 Adjusted EBITDA (g) (73,186 ) 456,922 401,279 Items added back to Adjusted EBITDA, after cost savings, as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement: Estimated cost savings (h) — 11,300 23,400 Adjusted EBITDA, after cost savings (i) $ (73,186 ) $ 468,222 $ 424,679 (a) Reflects a loss on early extinguishment of debt and write-off of discounts and debt issuance costs associated with an amendment to our Senior Secured Credit Facilities in 2018.

See Note 8–Property and Equipment, Net, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. (d) For the year ended December 31, 2020, business optimization, development and other strategic initiative costs primarily related to: (i) $3.1 million in third party consulting costs and (ii) $2.8 million of severance and other separation costs primarily related to the 2020 Restructuring Program. See Note 21 – Severance and Other Separation Costs in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. For the year ended December 31, 2019, business optimization, development and other strategic initiative costs primarily related to: (i) $21.2 million of third-party consulting costs and (ii) $4.2 million of severance and other employment costs. For the year ended December 31, 2018, business optimization, development and other strategic initiative costs primarily related to: (i) $17.4 million of severance and other employment costs which primarily includes costs associated with the departure of certain executives during 2018 and costs related to the 2018 Restructuring Program; (ii) $10.7 million of third party consulting costs; and (iii) $1.4 million of product and intellectual property development costs. (e) For the year ended December 31, 2019, includes approximately $4.3 million relating to expenses associated with the previously disclosed transfer of shares and HP Agreements. See Note 17–Related Party Transactions in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. For the year ended December 31, 2018, reflects primarily a loss of approximately $2.8 million relating to expenses incurred and fees associated with the termination of an agreement. 51 (f) Reflects the impact of certain expenses, net of insurance recoveries and adjustments , which we are permitted to exclude under the credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facilities due to the unusual nature of the items . For the year ended December 31, 2020, includes approximately $16. 9 million of legal settlement proceeds partially offset by approximately $8.8 million of incremental non-recurring costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and $3.3 million in other legal fees . The legal settlement proceeds received in 2020 relate to the following: (i) $12.5 million of insurance proceeds related to a legal settlement gain as previously disclosed and (ii) $4.4 million related to the return of funds previously paid for a legal settlement. The costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic primarily relate to incremental labor-related costs to prepare and operate the parks with enhanced safety measures, incremental thir d -party consult ing costs primarily related to our COVID-19 response and safety communication strategies, contract termination or modification costs related to impacts from the temporary COVID-19 park closures, legal costs related to COVID-19 related matters, and temporary or initial purchases of safety monitoring and personal protective equipment. For the year ended December 31, 2019, includes approximately $32.1 million related to a legal settlement charge, net of insurance recoveries. For the year ended December 31, 2018, includes $12.1 million related to legal settlements and $5.1 million in related legal fees which were partially offset by approximately $2.5 million of insurance recoveries received related to these legal matters. See Note 15–Commitments and Contingencies in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. (g) Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net (loss) income before income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted to exclude certain non-cash, and other items permitted in calculating covenant compliance under the credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. (h) The Senior Secured Credit Facilities permits the calculation of certain covenants to be based on Adjusted EBITDA, as defined above, for the last twelve month period further adjusted for net annualized estimated savings we expect to realize over the following 18 month period related to certain specified actions, including restructurings and cost savings initiatives. These estimated savings are calculated net of the amount of actual benefits realized during such period. These estimated savings are a non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA add-back item only as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement and does not impact our reported GAAP net (loss) income. The Amended Credit Agreement limits the amount of such estimated savings which may be reflected to 25% of Adjusted EBITDA, calculated for the last twelve months before the impact of these estimated cost savings. (i) The Senior Secured Credit Facilities permits our calculation of certain covenants to be based on Adjusted EBITDA, as defined above, for the last twelve-month period further adjusted for net annualized estimated savings as described in footnote (h) above. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020: Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years (In thousands) Long-term debt (including current portion) (a) $ 2,219,878 $ 15,505 $ 31,010 $ 2,173,363 $ — Interest on long-term debt (b) 514,427 125,622 250,240 138,565 — Operating and finance leases (c) 311,910 24,399 25,392 24,079 238,040 Purchase obligations, license commitments and other (d) 119,618 74,979 36,372 2,067 6,200 Total contractual obligations $ 3,165,833 $ 240,505 $ 343,014 $ 2,338,074 $ 244,240 (a) Represents principal payments.

In addition, in connection with the Sesame License Agreement, we have made certain commitments including opening a new Sesame Place theme park. As a result, obligations related to this agreement are included in the table above. For further details, 52 refer to Note 15–Commitments and Contingencies in our notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K . Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2020. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingencies during the reporting period. Significant estimates and assumptions include the valuation and useful lives of long-lived tangible and intangible assets, the valuation of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, the accounting for income taxes, the accounting for self-insurance and revenue recognition. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies which require management’s most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. For more discussion of these and other significant accounting policies, refer to Note 2–Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Goodwill, Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets At December 1, 2020, we performed a quantitative analysis on certain indefinite-lived intangible assets and determined fair value continued to exceed carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets and therefore no impairment of the assets had occurred. During this quantitative assessment, we calculated that the fair value of the tested indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded carrying value by 148%. Key assumptions utilized in the quantitative analysis was a weighted average cost of capital of 9.5% and an estimated royalty rate of 3%. During the year ended December 31, 2020, due to the temporary park closures effective March 16, 2020 and the limited park reopenings resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic discussed previously, we identified triggering events and qualitatively evaluated our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for further impairment analysis. Additionally, as of December 1, 2020, we also performed a qualitative impairment analysis of goodwill and the remaining other indefinite-lived intangible assets which included certain judgments and assumptions related to the impact of the park closures, reopening time frames and expected attendance levels upon reopening and determined that, based on the significant excess fair values over carrying values that previously existed, there was no impairment related to these assets. Additionally, using similar assumptions, we evaluated certain other long-lived assets, including our right of use assets for impairment. We compared the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of our long-lived and right of use assets to their respective carrying values. Based on the results of the analysis and our intent and ability to retain value and use for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market conditions, we concluded that the estimated undiscounted net cash flows for these assets exceeded its carrying value and therefore, no impairment of other long-lived assets had occurred. Given the macroeconomic environment related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the uncertainties regarding the related impact on financial performance, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the impairment assessments will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. If our assumptions, as well as the economic outlook are not achieved, we may be required to record impairment charges in future periods, whether in connection with our next annual impairment testing, or on an interim basis, if any such change constitutes a triggering event outside of the period when we regularly perform our annual impairment test. It is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or, if it does, whether such charge would be material. 53 For further details, also refer to Note 9–Goodwill and Tradenames/Trademarks, Net, in our notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Accounting for Income Taxes We are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation periods for property and equipment and deferred revenue, for tax and financial accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets. We must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets (primarily net operating loss and charitable contribution carryforwards) will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent that we believe that recovery is not more likely than not, a valuation allowance against those amounts is recorded. To the extent that we record a valuation allowance or a change in the valuation allowance during a period, we recognize these amounts as income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) contains rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change, which is generally any change in ownership of more than 50% of its stock over a rolling three-year period, to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards in years after the ownership change. These rules generally operate by focusing on ownership shifts among stockholders owning directly or indirectly 5% or more of the stock of a company and any change in ownership arising from shares of stock sold by these same stockholders. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision or benefit for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets. Management has analyzed all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard in assessing the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred income tax assets. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of the statutory carryback and carryforward periods and tax planning alternatives. The assumptions about future taxable income require the use of significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying business. We believe it is more likely than not that some of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. Therefore, we recorded a valuation allowance of approximately $39.5 million for federal net operating loss carryforwards, approximately $7.1 million for federal tax credits and approximately $4.0 million for federal and state charitable contributions as of December 31, 2020. Separately, we recorded a valuation allowance of approximately $15.0 million and $5.2 million, net of federal tax benefit, on the deferred tax assets related to state net operating losses as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our valuation allowances, in part, rely on estimates and assumptions related to our future financial performance. Given the macroeconomic environment related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the uncertainties regarding the related impact on financial performance, our valuation allowances may need to be adjusted in the future. Self-Insurance Reserves Reserves are recorded for the estimated amounts of guest and employee claims and expenses incurred each period that are not covered by insurance. Reserves are established for both identified claims and incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) claims. Such amounts are accrued for when claim amounts become probable and estimable. Reserves for identified claims are based upon our own historical claims experience and third-party estimates of settlement costs. Reserves for IBNR claims are based upon our own claims data history, as well as industry averages. All reserves are periodically reviewed for changes in facts and circumstances and adjustments are made as necessary. 54 Revenue Recognition Admissions revenue consists of single-day tickets, annual or season passes or other multi-day or multi-park admission products. Food, merchandise and other revenue primarily consists of culinary, merchandise and other in-park products and also includes other miscellaneous revenue, which is not significant in the periods presented. For single-day tickets, we recognize revenue at a point in time, upon admission to the park, and for food, merchandise and other in-park products we recognize revenue when the related products or services are received by our guests. For annual or season passes and multi-use admission products, revenue is deferred and recognized over the terms of the admission product based on estimated redemption rates for similar products and is adjusted periodically. We estimate a redemption rate using historical and forecasted growth rates and attendance trends by park for similar products. Attendance trends factor in seasonality and are adjusted based on actual trends periodically. Revenue is recognized on a pro-rata basis based on the estimated allocated selling price of the admission product. For pass products purchased on an installment plan that have met their initial commitment period and have transitioned to a month to month basis, monthly charges are recognized as revenue when payments are received each month, with the exception of payments received during the temporary park closures. For multi-day admission products, revenue is allocated based on the number of visits included in the pass and recognized ratably based on each admission into the theme park Certain admission products may also include bundled products at the time of purchase, such as culinary or merchandise items. We conduct an analysis of bundled products to identify separate distinct performance obligations that are material in the context of the contract. For those products that are determined to be distinct performance obligations and material in the context of the contract, we allocate a portion of the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation using each performance obligation’s standalone price. If the bundled product is related to a pass product and offered over time, revenue will be recognized over time accordingly. As a result of the temporary park closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we upgraded some of our pass products and extended pass expiration dates for at least the equivalent period the related parks were closed. As a result, we adjusted our estimated redemption and recognition patterns to reflect the fact that there was no attendance during the park closures and accordingly we did not recognize revenue from these admission products while the parks were closed. For passes under installment plans that have transitioned to a month to month basis, payments received during the closure period were recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as revenue once the parks reopen over the equivalent period the respective parks were temporarily closed, which may not necessarily reflect attendance patterns for these guests. Accordingly, for these passes, we temporarily paused monthly charges as the parks reopen for the equivalent period the parks were closed. We have estimated future redemption and recognition patterns for admission pass products, which impacts the timing of when revenue is recognized on these products. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates depending on the ultimate extent of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. For further details, also refer to Note 4–Revenues, in our notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Inflation The impact of inflation has affected, and will continue to affect, our operations significantly. Our costs of food, merchandise and other revenues are influenced by inflation and fluctuations in global commodity prices. In addition, costs for construction, repairs and maintenance are all subject to inflationary pressures. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates, and to a lesser extent on currency exchange rates, from time to time, on imported rides and equipment. The objective of our financial risk management is to reduce the potential negative impact of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to acceptable levels. We do not acquire market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes. We previously managed interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed-rate long-term debt and interest rate swaps that fixed a portion of our variable-rate long-term debt. In May 2020, our interest rate swap agreements expired, as such, we did not have any derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2020. We presently manage interest rate risk primarily by managing the amount, sources and duration of our debt funding. At December 31, 2020, approximately $1.5 billion of our outstanding long-term debt represents variable-rate debt. Assuming an average balance on our revolving credit borrowings of approximately $311.0 million, a hypothetical 100 bps increase in LIBOR would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $9.0 million. Assuming no revolving credit borrowings, a hypothetical 100 bps increase in LIBOR would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $5.9 million. COVID-19 Risks and Uncertainties See “ Risk Factors” for further discussion of the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial performance. 55 Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto are provided in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), require public companies, including us, to maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” which are defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act to mean a company’s controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required or necessary disclosures. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. The design of any controls and procedures also is based on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation and subject to the foregoing, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to accomplish their objectives at a reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Regulations under the Exchange Act require public companies, including our Company, to evaluate any change in our “internal control over financial reporting” as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. We have not experienced any material impact to our internal controls over financial reporting despite the fact that certain employees worked remotely due to the COVID-19 related park closures and some continue to work on a remote basis. We are continually monitoring and assessing the COVID-19 situation on our internal controls to minimize the impact on their design and operating effectiveness. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal year covered by this Annual Report that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting As required by the SEC’s rules and regulations for the implementation of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company, (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors, and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements in our consolidated financial statements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making these assessments, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) . Based on our assessments and those criteria, management determined that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. 56 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued a report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income, changes in stockholders’ (deficit) equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 26, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Change in Accounting Principle Effective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Topic Accounting Standards Codification 842 —Leases , using the modified retrospective approach. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Revenue Recognition—Deferred Revenue Related to Annual and Season Admission Pass Products—Refer to Note 2 and Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company’s annual and season passes allow guests access to specific parks over a specified time period. Such revenue is deferred and recognized over the terms of the admission product based on estimated redemption rates for similar products and is adjusted periodically. The Company estimates a redemption rate using historical and forecasted growth rates and attendance trends by park for similar products. Attendance trends factor in seasonality and are adjusted based on actual trends periodically. As a result of the temporary park closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company upgraded some of their pass products and extended pass expiration dates for at least the equivalent period the related parks were closed which were considered in the estimated redemption and recognition patterns. Revenue is recognized on a pro rata basis based on the estimated allocated selling price of the admission product. The Company tracks and recognizes deferred revenue utilizing internally developed models. Auditing the attendance projections by park, which is the primary input used in the deferred revenue models, and the redemption rates calculated through the models, required extensive audit effort due to the complexity and manual nature of the models. F-2 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the attendance projections by park and the recognition of revenue from the deferred revenue related to annual and season admission pass products included the following, among others: • We tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over revenue recognition related to annual and season admission pass products, including controls over actual and forecasted attendance used in the models. • We evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast expected attendance by comparing actual results to management’s historical forecasts on a quarterly basis. • We evaluated the reasonableness of the current-year attendance forecasts compared to historical results, considering recent trends in the Company’s attendance. • We tested the mathematical accuracy and appropriateness of management’s deferred revenue models and timing of recognition, including changes to the model to account for pass extensions as a result of park closures. • We detail tested the deferred revenue balances, related to annual and season admission pass products. Further, we evaluated the reasonableness of the expected future relief of the deferred balances, in particularly with respect to the impact of COVID-19 and pass product upgrades and extensions. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Tampa, Florida February 26, 2021 We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2009. F-3 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 of the Company and our report dated February 26, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and included an explanatory paragraph regarding the Company’s adoption of a new accounting standard. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Tampa, Florida February 26, 2021 F-4 SEAWORLD ENTERTAINMENT, INC.

F-8 SEAWORLD ENTERTAINMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc., through its wholly-owned subsidiary, SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc. (“SEA”) (collectively, the “Company”), owns and operates twelve theme parks within the United States. Prior to December 1, 2009, the Company did not have any operations. On December 1, 2009, the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity interest of Busch Entertainment LLC and affiliates from Anheuser Busch Companies, Inc. and Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (“ABI”). At that time, the Company was owned by ten limited partnerships, ultimately controlled by affiliates of The Blackstone Group L.P. (“Blackstone”) and certain co-investors. The Company completed an initial public offering in April 2013. See further discussion relating to subsequent ownership changes in Note 17–Related-Party Transactions. The Company operates SeaWorld theme parks in Orlando, Florida; San Antonio, Texas; and San Diego, California, and Busch Gardens theme parks in Tampa, Florida, and Williamsburg, Virginia. The Company operates water attraction theme parks in Orlando, Florida (Aquatica); San Antonio, Texas (Aquatica); Chula Vista, California, (Aquatica); Tampa, Florida (Adventure Island); and Williamsburg, Virginia (Water Country USA). The Company also operates a reservations-only theme park in Orlando, Florida (Discovery Cove) and a seasonal theme park in Langhorne, Pennsylvania (Sesame Place). Historically more than 50 % of the Company’s revenues were generated in the State of Florida which exposes the Company to risks affecting the Florida market, such as natural disasters, severe weather or other incidents. During the year ended December 31, 2020, more than 70 % of the Company’s revenues were generated in the State of Florida, due in part to the temporary park closures and limited operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. See Impact of Global COVID-19 Pandemic section which follows for further discussion on factors impacting 2020 revenues. Impact of Global COVID-19 Pandemic In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and in compliance with government restrictions, the Company temporarily closed all of its theme parks effective March 16, 2020. Beginning in June 2020, the Company began the phased reopening of some of its parks with enhanced health, safety and sanitizing measures, capacity limitations, modified/limited operations, reduced hours and/or reduced operating days. In particular, on June 6, its Aquatica water park in Texas reopened; on June 11, all five of its Florida parks reopened; on June 19, its SeaWorld park in Texas reopened; on July 24, its Sesame Place park in Pennsylvania reopened; on August 5, its Busch Gardens park in Virginia reopened and on August 28, its SeaWorld park in California reopened on a limited basis, following the State of California’s guidance for reopening zoos. In compliance with revised state governmental restrictions issued late in the fourth quarter in California, the Company once again closed its SeaWorld park in California effective December 7, 2020. The Company was unable to open its Aquatica water park in California and its Water Country USA water park in Virginia for the 2020 operating season. Additionally, during the third quarter, the State of Virginia had a state mandated capacity restriction of 1,000 guests at a time which significantly restricted attendance for the Company’s Busch Gardens park in that state. On October 29, 2020, the State of Virginia revised its theme park guidance and modified the methodology for calculating capacity at theme parks. As a result, capacity at this park increased from 1,000 guests to approximately 4,000 guests at a time. On January 15, 2021, while the Company’s SeaWorld park in California park remained closed, the Company introduced a limited time drive-through only experience for guests at this park. Subsequently, based on updated state government guidance issued in January 2021, the Company has since reopened its SeaWorld park in California on February 6, 2021 on a limited basis, once again following California guidance for reopening zoos. The Company continues to monitor guidance from, and engage with, federal, state and local authorities and may adjust its plans accordingly. Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, the Company has taken proactive measures for the safety of its guests, employees and animals, to manage costs and expenditures, and to maximize liquidity in response to the temporary park closures and limited reopenings related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of these measures included, but are not limited to: (i) increased its revolving credit commitments on March 10th; (ii) issued $ 227.5 million in first-priority senior secured notes and $ 500.0 million in second-priority senior secured notes to raise additional capital and further enhance available liquidity; (iii) entered into amendments to its existing senior secured credit facilities to amend financial covenants; (iv) furloughed approximately 95% of its employees upon closing all of its parks; (v) obtained payroll tax credits and deferred certain social security payroll taxes under the CARES act; (vi) temporarily reduced executive officers’ base salary by 20% through November 2020; (vii) eliminated and/or deferred all non-essential operating expenses at all of its parks and corporate headquarters while the parks were closed and actively managing operating expenses; (viii) eliminated substantially all advertising and marketing spend while the parks were closed and strategically managing marketing spend as parks reopened; (ix) substantially reduced or deferred all capital expenditures starting in March 2020 (other than minimal essential capital expenditures) when the parks were closed and postponed the opening of rides that were still under construction and scheduled to open in 2020; (x) worked with certain of its vendors and other business partners to manage, defer, and/or abate certain costs and payments and; (xi) added additional levels of review and approval for payments and cash disbursements which remains in place. Concurrent with the reopening of some of its parks, the Company began to prudently bring some employees back from furlough. Some of its F-9 employees remain on furlough while others have been transitioned from a furloughed status to a permanent layoff. See Note 21–Severance and Other Separation Costs for additional disclosure. The COVID-19 pandemic, resulting park closures and limited park reopenings have had, and are likely to continue to have, a material impact on the Company’s financial results. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including SEA. All intercompany accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, the accounting for self-insurance, deferred tax assets and liabilities, deferred revenue, equity compensation, the valuation of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets as well as reviews for potential impairment of long-lived assets. Estimates are based on various factors including current and historical trends, as well as other pertinent company and industry data. The Company regularly evaluates this information to determine if it is necessary to update the basis for its estimates and to adjust for known changes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Based on the uncertainty relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, including but not limited to the extent, duration and impact of park closures, limited park reopenings, capacity limitations due to social distancing guidelines, public sentiment on social gatherings, travel and attendance patterns, potential supply chain disruptions and additional actions which could be taken by government authorities to manage the pandemic, the Company is not certain of the ultimate impact the COVID-19 pandemic could have on its estimates, business or results of operations. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash held at financial institutions as well as operating cash onsite at each theme park to fund daily operations and amounts due from third-party credit card companies with settlement terms of less than four days . The amounts due from third-party credit card companies totaled $ 4.9 million and $ 9.7 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The cash balances in all accounts held at financial institutions are insured up to $ 250,000 by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) through December 31, 2020. At times, cash balances may exceed federally insured amounts and potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk. Management believes that no significant concentration of credit risk exists with respect to these cash balances because of its assessment of the creditworthiness and financial viability of the respective financial institutions. From time to time, the Company may invest in certain highly liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less. These instruments may include money market mutual funds, certificates of deposit or time deposits, among others, which may or may not qualify for FDIC insurance. The Company classifies any such instruments as cash and cash equivalents based on their short-term maturities. Restricted Cash Restricted cash is recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Restricted cash consists primarily of funds received from strategic partners for use in approved marketing and promotional activities. December 31, December 31, 2020 2019 (In thousands) Cash and cash equivalents $ 433,909 $ 39,946 Restricted cash, included in prepaid expenses and other current assets 1,316 979 Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 435,225 $ 40,925 Accounts Receivable—Net Accounts receivable are reported at net realizable value and consist primarily of amounts due from customers for the sale of admission products, including amounts due for admissions products purchased on monthly installment arrangements. The Company is not exposed to a significant concentration of credit risk. The Company records an allowance on trade accounts receivable with an offset to the provision for bad debt for estimated credit losses expected based on its history of uncollectable accounts. For all periods presented, F-10 the provision for bad debt was immaterial. The Company also records an allowance for estimated credit losses on amounts due from monthly installment arrangements based on historical defaul t rates. As of December 31, 2020 and 201 9 , the Company recorded $ 6.7 million and $ 12.1 million, respectively, as an allowance on its installment arrangements , which is included in accounts rec ei vable, net, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, with a corresponding reduction to deferred revenue. Inventories Inventories are accounted for using the weighted average cost method and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventories consist primarily of products for resale, including merchandise, culinary items and miscellaneous supplies. Obsolete or excess inventories are recorded at their estimated realizable value. Property and Equipment—Net Property and equipment are recorded at cost. The cost of ordinary or routine maintenance, repairs, spare parts and minor renewals is expensed as incurred. Development costs associated with new attractions and products are generally capitalized after necessary feasibility studies have been completed and final concept or contracts have been approved. The cost of assets is depreciated using the straight-line method based on the following estimated useful lives: Land improvements 10 - 40 years Buildings 5 - 40 years Rides, attractions and equipment 3 - 20 years Animals 1 - 50 years Certain costs related to animals exhibited in the theme parks are capitalized and amortized over their estimated lives ( 1 - 50 years ). All costs to care for animals are expensed as incurred. Construction in progress assets consist primarily of new rides, attractions and infrastructure improvements that have not yet been placed in service. These assets are stated at cost and are not depreciated. Once construction of the assets is completed and placed into service, assets are reclassified to the appropriate asset class based on their nature and depreciated in accordance with the useful lives above. Debt interest is capitalized on all active construction projects. Total interest capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $ 6.3 million, $ 4.6 million and $ 4.2 million, respectively. Computer System Development Costs The Company capitalizes computer system development costs that meet established criteria and, once placed in service, amortizes those costs to expense on a straight-line basis over five years . Total capitalized costs related to computer system development costs, net of accumulated amortization, were $ 2.4 million and $ 4.2 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are recorded in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Accumulated amortization was $ 11.2 million and $ 9.5 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Amortization expense of capitalized computer system development costs during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $ 1.7 million, $ 2.2 million and $ 3.7 million, respectively, and is recorded in depreciation and amortization in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. Systems reengineering costs do not meet the proper criteria for capitalization and are expensed as incurred. Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but instead reviewed for impairment at least annually on December 1, and as of an interim date should factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim test, with ongoing recoverability based on applicable reporting unit overall financial performance and consideration of significant events or changes in the overall business environment or macroeconomic conditions. Such events or changes in the overall business environment could include, but are not limited to, significant negative trends or unanticipated changes in the competitive or macroeconomic environment. F-11 In assessing goodwill for impairment, the Company may choose to initially evaluate qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The Company considers several factors, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance of the reporting unit, changes in management, strategy or customers, and relevant reporting unit specific events such as a change in the carrying amount of net assets, a more likely than not expectation of selling or disposing all, or a portion, of a reporting unit, and the testing of recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment is not conclusive, then a quantitative impairment analysis for goodwill is performed at the reporting unit level. The Company may also choose to perform this quantitative impairment analysis instead of the qualitative analysis. The quantitative impairment analysis compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, determined using the income and/or market approach, to its recorded amount. If the recorded amount exceeds the fair value, then a goodwill impairment charge is recorded for the difference up to the recorded amount of goodwill. The determination of fair value in the Company’s goodwill impairment analysis is based on an estimate of fair value for the relevant reporting unit utilizing known and estimated inputs at the evaluation date. Some of those inputs include, but are not limited to, estimates of future revenue and expense growth, estimated market multiples, expected capital expenditures, income tax rates and cost of invested cap ital. The Company’s other indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of certain trade names/trademarks and other intangible assets which, after considering legal, regulatory, contractual, and other competitive and economic factors, are determined to have indefinite lives and are valued using the relief from royalty method. Trade names/trademarks are combined by brand as a unit of accounting when testing for impairment as the brand represents the highest and best use of the asset and drives the Company’s marketing strategy and international license agreements. Estimates required in this valuation method include estimated future revenues impacted by the trade names/trademarks, royalty rates, and appropriate discount rates. Projections are based on management’s best estimates given recent financial performance, market trends, strategic plans, brand awareness, operating characteristics by park, and other available information. See Note 9–Goodwill, Trade Names/Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets, Net, for further details. During the year ended December 31, 2020, due to the temporary park closures effective March 16, 2020 and the limited park reopenings resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic discussed previously, the Company identified triggering events and qualitatively evaluated its goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for further impairment analysis. These qualitative evaluations included certain judgements and assumptions related to the impact of the temporary park closures, the extent and duration of capacity limitations, the expected attendance levels and number of operating days/hours and the significant excess of historical fair values over carrying values and determined that, no further impairment analysis was warranted. As such, the Company did no t record an impairment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2020. If the Company’s assumptions, including those around the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its projections of future cash flows and financial performance, as well as the economic outlook are not achieved, the Company may be required to record impairment charges in future periods, whether in connection with the Company’s next annual impairment testing, or on an interim basis, if any such change constitutes a triggering event outside of the quarter when the Company regularly performs its annual impairment test. It is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or, if it does, whether such charge would be material. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets All long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. An impairment loss may be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset, including disposition, are less than the carrying value of the asset. The measurement of the impairment loss to be recognized is based upon the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying amounts of the assets. As discussed above, during the year ended December 31, 2020, due to the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company identified triggering events and qualitatively evaluated certain long-lived assets, including its right of use assets, for further impairment analysis. Using similar assumptions as discussed above, the Company determined that, based on the significant excess estimated undiscounted cash flows over carrying values, there was no impairment of other long-lived assets. Fair value is generally determined based upon a discounted cash flow analysis. In order to determine if an asset has been impaired, assets are grouped and tested at the lowest level for which identifiable independent cash flows are available (generally a theme park). See further discussion in Note 8–Property and Equipment, Net. F-12 Self-Insurance Reserves Reserves are recorded for the estimated amounts of guest and employee claims and expenses incurred each period that are not covered by insurance. Reserves are established for both identified claims and incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) claims. Such amounts are accrued for when claim amounts become probable and estimable. Reserves for identified claims are based upon the Company’s historical claims experience and third-party estimates of settlement costs. Reserves for IBNR claims are based upon the Company’s claims data history, actuarially determined loss development factors and qualitative considerations such as claims management activities. The Company maintains self-insurance reserves for healthcare, auto, general liability and workers’ compensation claims. Total claims reserves were $ 31.1 million at December 31, 2020, of which $ 1.8 million is recorded in accrued salaries, wages and benefits, $ 7.5 million is recorded in other accrued liabilities and the remaining long-term portion is recorded in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Total claims reserves were $ 31.7 million at December 31, 2019, of which $ 2.8 million is recorded in accrued salaries, wages and benefits, $ 7.5 million is recorded in other accrued liabilities and the remaining long-term portion is recorded in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. All reserves are periodically reviewed for changes in facts and circumstances and adjustments are made as necessary. Debt Issuance Costs Debt issuance costs are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the related debt and are included in long-term debt, net, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. See further discussion in Note 11–Long-Term Debt. Share Repurchase Program and Treasury Stock From time to time, the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) may authorize share repurchases of common stock. Shares repurchased under Board authorizations are held in treasury for general corporate purposes. The Company accounts for treasury stock on the trade date under the cost method. Treasury stock at December 31, 2020 and 2019 is recorded as a reduction to stockholders’ (deficit) equity as the Company does not currently intend to retire the treasury stock held. See further discussion of the Company’s share repurchase program in Note 20–Stockholders’ (Deficit) Equity. Revenue Recognition The Company records revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”), Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements within the scope of ASC 606, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contracts with customers; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies the performance obligations. ASC 606 also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts. Revenue is recorded net of sales-related taxes collected from guests and remitted or payable to government taxing authorities. Admissions Revenue Admissions revenue primarily consists of single-day tickets, annual or season passes or other multi-day or multi-park admission products. Admission products with similar characteristics are analyzed using a portfolio approach for each separate park as the Company expects that the effects on the consolidated financial statements of applying ASC 606 to the portfolio does not differ materially from applying the guidance to individual contracts within the portfolio. For single-day tickets, the Company recognizes revenue at a point in time, upon admission to the park. Annual passes, season passes or other multi-day or multi-park passes allow guests access to specific parks over a specified time period. For these pass and multi-use products, revenue is deferred and recognized over the terms of the admission product based on estimated redemption rates for similar products and is adjusted periodically. The Company estimates a redemption rate using historical and forecasted growth rates and attendance trends by park for similar products. Due to the temporary park closures, capacity limitations and product extensions in 2020, the Company evaluated the estimates and assumptions used in its future estimated redemption rates for these products based on forecasted and actual attendance patterns. Attendance trends factor in seasonality and are adjusted based on actual trends periodically, including to reflect recent trends. Revenue is recognized on a pro-rata basis based on the estimated allocated selling price of the admission product. For active pass products purchased under monthly installment arrangements that have extended beyond their initial commitment term and have transitioned to a month to month basis, revenue is recognized monthly as payments are received, with the exception of payments received during the temporary park closures (see further discussion which follows). For multi-day admission products, revenue is allocated based on the number of visits included in the pass and recognized ratably based on each admission into the theme park. As a result of the temporary park closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company upgraded some of its pass products and extended pass expiration dates for at least the equivalent period the related parks were closed. As a result, the Company adjusted its estimated redemption and recognition patterns related to its admission products to reflect the fact that there was no attendance during the park closures and accordingly the Company did not recognize revenue from these admission products while the parks were closed. F-13 For passes under installment plans that have transitioned to a month to month basis, payments received during the closure period are recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as revenue once the respective park reopens, which may not necessarily reflect attendance patterns for these guests. Accordingly, for these passes, the Company temporarily paused monthly charges when the related parks reopened for the equivalent period the respective parks were closed. The Company has estimated future redemption and recognition patterns for admission pass products , which impacts the timing of when revenue is recognized on these products . Actual results could materially differ from these estimates depending on the ultimate extent of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company has also entered into agreements with certain external theme park, zoo and other attraction operators to jointly market and sell single and multi-use admission products. These joint products allow admission to both a Company park(s) and an external park, zoo or other attraction. The agreements with the external partners specify the allocation of revenue to Company parks from any jointly sold products. Whether the Company or the external partner sells the product, the Company’s portion of revenue is deferred until the first time the product is redeemed at one of the Company’s parks and recognized over its related use in a manner consistent with the Company’s other admission products. Additionally, the Company barters theme park admission products and sponsorship opportunities for advertising, employee recognition awards, and various other services. The fair value of the products or services is recognized into admissions revenue and related expenses at the time of the exchange and approximates the estimated fair value of the goods or services provided or received, whichever is more readily determinable. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, amounts included within admissions revenue with an offset to either selling, general and administrative expenses or operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income related to bartered ticket transactions were $ 4.7 million, $ 16.2 million and $ 16.6 million, respectively. Food, Merchandise and Other Revenue Food, merchandise and other revenue primarily consists of culinary, merchandise, parking and other in-park products and also includes other miscellaneous revenue which is not significant in the periods presented, including revenue related to the Company’s international agreements as discussed in Note 4–Revenues. The Company recognizes revenue for food, merchandise and other in-park products when the related products or services are received by the guests. Certain admission products may also include bundled products at the time of purchase, such as culinary or merchandise items. The Company conducts an analysis of bundled products to identify separate distinct performance obligations that are material in the context of the contract. For those products that are determined to be distinct performance obligations and material in the context of the contract, the Company allocates a portion of the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation using each performance obligation’s standalone price. If the bundled product is related to a pass product and offered over time, revenue will be recognized over time accordingly. See further discussion in Note 4–Revenues. Advertising and Promotional Costs Advertising production costs are deferred and expensed the first time the advertisement is shown. Other advertising and media costs are expensed as incurred and for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, totaled approximately $ 48.1 million, $ 138.3 million and $ 127.5 million, respectively, and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. Equity-Based Compensation In accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation , the Company measures the cost of employee services rendered in exchange for equity-based compensation based upon the grant date fair market value. The cost is recognized over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period unless service or performance conditions require otherwise. The Company recognizes equity compensation expense for its performance-vesting restricted awards ratably over the related performance period if the performance condition is probable of being achieved. If the probability of vesting related to these awards changes in a subsequent period, all equity compensation expense related to those awards that would have been recorded over the requisite service period had the awards been considered probable at the new percentage from inception, is recorded as a cumulative catch-up at such subsequent date. The Company recognizes the impact of forfeitures as they occur. The Company grants time-vesting restricted shares and units, time-vesting deferred stock units, performance-vesting restricted shares and units, and stock options. The Company uses the closing stock price on the date of grant to value its time-vesting and performance-vesting restricted share awards. The Company uses the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model to value stock options at the date of grant. On occasion, the Company may modify the terms or conditions of an equity award for its employees. If an award is modified, the Company evaluates the type of modification in accordance with ASC 718 to determine the appropriate accounting. See further discussion in Note 19–Equity-Based Compensation. F-14 Restructuring Costs The Company accounts for exit or disposal of activities in accordance with ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations if the one-time benefit arrangements are not part of an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract. Nonretirement post-employment benefits that are part of an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract are accounted for in accordance with ASC 712, Compensation-Nonretirement Postemployment Benefits . The Company defines a business restructuring as an exit or disposal activity that includes but is not limited to a program which is planned and controlled by management and materially changes either the scope of a business or the manner in which that business is conducted. Business restructuring charges may include (i) one-time termination benefits related to employee separations, (ii) contract termination costs and (iii) other related costs associated with exit or disposal activities. If the one-time benefit arrangements are not part of an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract, a liability is recognized and measured at its fair value for one-time termination benefits once the plan of termination is communicated to affected employees and it meets all of the following criteria: (i) management commits to a plan of termination, (ii) the plan identifies the number of employees to be terminated and their job classifications or functions, locations and the expected completion date, (iii) the plan establishes the terms of the benefit arrangement and (iv) it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or the plan will be withdrawn. If the one-time benefit arrangements are part of an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract, a liability is recognized and measured at its fair value for one-time termination benefits when the following conditions are met: (i) the obligation is attributable to services already rendered; (ii) rights to those benefits accumulate; (iii) payment of the benefits is probable; and (iv) amount can be reasonably estimated. If these four conditions are not met, a liability is recognized when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated in accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies . Contract termination costs include costs to terminate a contract or costs that will continue to be incurred under the contract without benefit to the Company. A liability is recognized and measured at its fair value when the Company either terminates the contract or ceases using the rights conveyed by the contract. See further discussion in Note 21–Severance and Other Separation Costs. Leases The Company leases land, warehouse and office space, and equipment, which are classified as either operating or finance leases. Under the provisions of ASC 842, lease liabilities and right of use assets are recognized at the lease commencement date on the basis of the present value of the future lease payments, with the right of use being adjusted by any prepaid or accrued rent, lease incentives, and initial direct costs. The lease term for each lease includes the noncancelable period plus any periods subject to an option for renewal when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. The subsequent measurement of a lease is dependent on whether the lease is classified as an operating or finance lease. Operating leases have a straight-line expense pattern that is recognized as either operating expenses or selling, general, and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. Finance leases have a front-loaded expense recognition pattern that is comprised of amortization expense and interest expense that is included in depreciation and amortization and interest expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. The Company initially evaluates the classification of its leases as of the lease commencement date and reevaluates the classification of its leases upon the occurrence of certain lease remeasurement events and when there is a lease modification that is not accounted for as a separate contract. The present value of future lease payments is calculated using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Company’s incremental borrowing rate, which reflects the rate of interest it would pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments under similar terms. As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses incremental borrowing rates based on the information available at the lease commencement date, liability remeasurement date, or lease modification date in determining the present value of the lease payments. In calculating the incremental borrowing rates, the Company considered recent ratings from credit agencies, recent trading prices on the Company’s debt, and current lease demographic information. The Company applies the incremental borrowing rates at a portfolio level based on lease terms. The Company has elected the short-term lease recognition exemption by which it is not required to recognize on the balance sheet leases with an initial lease term of 12 months or less, with the lease expense for these short-term leases recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For lease agreements entered into or reassessed upon adoption of ASC 842, the Company has elected the available practical expedient to not separate the non-lease components from the related lease component, accounting for the combined components as a single lease component. The short-term lease recognition exemption and the practical expedient to not separate the lease and non-lease components was elected for each class of underlying asset as permitted under ASC 842. Some of the Company’s leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from one to ten years or more. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Company’s sole discretion and the inclusion of the renewal options in the lease term would only occur when the Company concludes it is reasonably certain of exercising the option(s). Certain leases also include options to purchase the leased property. F-15 Certain of the Company’s lease agreements include rental payments based on a percentage of sales over contractual levels and others include rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation. These variable lease payments are typically recognized when the underlying event occurs and are included in operating expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income in the same line item as the expense arising from fixed lease payments. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees, material restrictive covenants or material variable lease costs other than those described in Note 14–Leases related to the Company’s land lease. All long-lived assets, including right of use assets associated with leases, are reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. The measurement of an impairment loss to be recognized is based upon the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying amounts of the assets. Fair value is generally determined based upon a discounted cash flow analysis. See further discussion in Note 14–Leases. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Realization is dependent on generating sufficient future taxable income or the reversal of deferred tax liabilities during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. The Company evaluates its tax positions by determining if it is more likely than not a tax position is sustainable upon examination, based upon the technical merits of the position, before any of the benefit is recorded for financial statement purposes. The benefit is measured as the largest dollar amount of the position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon settlement. Previously recorded benefits that no longer meet the more likely than not threshold are charged to earnings in the period that the determination is made. Interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits are charged to the (benefit from) provision for income taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. See further discussion in Note 13–Income Taxes. Contingencies The Company accounts for contingencies in accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies . For loss contingencies, such as potential legal settlements, the Company records an estimated loss when payment is considered probable and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company, the Company evaluates the perceived merits of the legal proceedings as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein. If a loss is considered probable but the best estimate of the loss can only be identified within a range and no specific amount within that range is more likely, then the minimum of the range is accrued. Legal and related professional services costs to defend litigation are expensed as incurred. Insurance recoveries related to potential claims are recognized up to the amount of the recorded liability when coverage is confirmed and the estimated recoveries are probable of payment. These recoveries are not netted against the related liabilities for financial statement presentation. Additionally, for any potential gain contingencies, the Company does not recognize the gain until the period that all contingencies have been resolved and the amounts are realizable. See further discussion in Note 15–Commitments and Contingencies. Fair Value Measurements Fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement and is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. An entity is permitted to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each period. The Company has not elected to use the fair value option for any of its financial assets and financial liabilities that are not already recorded at fair value. Carrying values of financial instruments classified as current assets and current liabilities approximate fair value, due to their short-term nature. Fair Value Hierarchy —As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, fair value accounting standards establish a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity. Fair value is determined for assets and liabilities, based upon significant levels of observable or unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s market assumptions. This hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. These two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy: Level 1 —Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. F-16 Level 2 —Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets. Level 3 —Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. Determination of Fair Value —If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed valuation techniques that use, where possible, current market-based or independently sourced market parameters, such as interest and currency rates. Assets or liabilities valued using such internally generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation. Thus, an item may be classified in Level 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that are readily observable. See further discussion in Note 16–Fair Value Measurements. Segment Reporting The Company maintains discrete financial information for each of its twelve theme parks, which is used by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”), identified as the Chief Executive Officer, or equivalent role, as a basis for allocating resources and assessing performance. Each theme park has been identified as an operating segment and meets the criteria for aggregation due to similar economic characteristics. In addition, all of the theme parks provide similar products and services and share similar processes for delivering services. The theme parks have a high degree of similarity in the workforces and target similar consumer groups. Accordingly, based on these economic and operational similarities and the way the CODM monitors and makes decisions affecting the operations, the Company has concluded that its operating segments may be aggregated and that it has one reportable segment. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging , provides the disclosure requirements for derivatives and hedging activities with the intent to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of: (i) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (ii) how the entity accounts for derivative instruments and related hedged items, and (iii) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Further, qualitative disclosures are required that explain the Company’s objectives and strategies for using derivatives, as well as quantitative disclosures about the fair value of, and gains and losses on, derivative instruments, and disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative instruments. As required by ASC 815, the Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value as either assets or liabilities. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. For derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk, the changes in fair value of the derivative contract are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, and subsequently reclassified into interest expense in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge. The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of its risk, even though hedge accounting does not apply or the Company elects not to apply hedge accounting. See further discussion in Note 12–Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. 3. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS The Company reviews new accounting pronouncements as they are issued or proposed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). Recently Implemented Accounting Standards During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company adopted the following Accounting Standards Updates (“ASUs”) which had no material impact on its consolidated financial statements or disclosures: • FASB Staff Q&A : On April 10, 2020, the FASB staff issued FASB Staff Q&A-Topic 842 and Topic 840: Accounting for Lease Concessions Related to the Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic which stated that entities may elect to account for lease concessions related to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic as though the rights and obligations for those concessions existed as of the commencement of the contract rather than as a lease modification. Lessees may make the election for any lessor-provided lease concession related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as long as the concession does not result in a substantial increase in the rights of the lessor or in the obligations of the lessee. The Company has made such election. The Company has received immaterial rent concessions and has not entered into any lease modifications for the year ended F-17 December 31, 2020 . As such, this election did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements nor the related disclosures. • ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (Topic 326) , This ASU requires the immediate recognition of estimated credit losses expected to occur over the life of financial assets rather than the current incurred loss impairment model that recognizes losses when a probability threshold is met. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements or disclosures. Recently Issued Accounting Standards The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the following recently issued ASUs: • ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) , provides optional transition guidance to ease the potential accounting burden associated with transitioning away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), with optional expedients related to the application of GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform. The provisions of this ASU are effective upon issuance and can be applied prospectively through December 31, 2022. Companies can apply this ASU immediately, but application is through December 31, 2020. The Company is evaluating the impact of LIBOR on its existing contracts but does not expect that this ASU will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements or related disclosures. • ASU 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes , simplifies various aspects related to accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and clarifying certain aspects of the current guidance to promote consistency among reporting entities. ASU 2019-12 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2021. Early adoption requires adoption of all amendments in the same period. Most amendments within this ASU are required to be applied on a prospective basis, while certain amendments must be applied on a retrospective or modified retrospective basis. The Company is currently evaluating ASU 2019-12 but does not expect that this ASU will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements or related disclosures. 4. REVENUES Deferred revenue primarily includes revenue associated with pass products, admission or in-park products or services with a future intended use date and contract liability balances related to licensing and international agreements collected in advance of the Company satisfying its performance obligations and is expected to be recognized in future periods. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, $ 13.4 million and $ 10.0 million, respectively, is included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets related to the long-term portion of deferred revenue, which primarily relates to the Company’s international agreement, as discussed in the following section. The Company expects to recognize this revenue over the term of the respective license agreement beginning when substantially all of the services have been performed, which is expected to be upon opening. The following table reflects the Company’s deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2020 and 2019: 2020 2019 (In thousands) Deferred revenue, including long-term portion $ 144,187 $ 114,416 Less: Deferred revenue, long-term portion, included in other liabilities 13,428 10,000 Deferred revenue, short-term portion $ 130,759 $ 104,416 The majority of the deferred revenue, short term portion, balance outstanding as of January 1, 2020 was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020, with approximately 5 % remaining as deferred revenue as of December 31, 2020 due to product extensions. The increase in deferred revenue as of December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 primarily relates to extensions provided on some of the Company’s admission products due to the COVID-19 temporary park closures. International Agreements The Company has received $ 10.0 million in deferred revenue recorded in other liabilities related to a nonrefundable payment received from a partner in connection with a project in the Middle East (the “Middle East Project”) to provide certain services pertaining to the planning and design of the Middle East Project, with funding received expected to offset internal expenses. The Company expects to receive additional funds from its partner related to agreed upon services and reimbursements of costs incurred by the Company on behalf of the Middle East Project. Approximately $ 5.9 million and $ 5.0 million of costs incurred related to the Middle East Project are recorded in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company has recognized an asset for the costs incurred to fulfill the contract as the costs are specifically identifiable, enhance resources that will be used to satisfy performance obligations in the future and are expected to be recovered. The related deferred revenue and expense will begin to be recognized when substantially all of the services have been performed, which is expected to be upon opening of the park. The Company continually monitors performance on the contract and will make adjustments, if necessary. F-18 Construction for the Middle East Project is on track and scheduled to be completed by the end of 2022. There is no assurance that the Middle East Project will be completed or open to the public. In March 2017, the Company entered into a Park Exclusivity and Concept Design Agreement and a Center Concept and Preliminary Design Support Agreement (collectively, the “ZHG Agreements”) with an affiliate of Zhonghong Zhuoye Group Co., Ltd. (“ZHG Group”), to provide design, support and advisory services for various potential projects and grant exclusive rights in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau. In April 2019, the Company terminated the ZHG Agreements for non-payment of undisputed amounts owed. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the Company recorded revenue related to the ZHG Agreements of approximately $ 1.7 million and $ 5.1 million, respectively, which is included in food, merchandise and other revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. There were no amounts recorded as revenue related to the ZHG Agreements in the year ended December 31, 2020 See Note 17–Related-Party Transactions for further details. 5. (LOSS) EARNINGS PER SHARE (Loss) earnings per share is computed as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Net Loss Shares Per Share Amount Net Income Shares Per Share Amount Net Income Shares Per Share Amount (In thousands, except per share amounts) Basic (loss) earnings per share $ ( 312,321 ) 78,194 $ ( 3.99 ) $ 89,476 80,309 $ 1.11 $ 44,788 86,170 $ 0.52 Effect of dilutive incentive-based awards — 735 740 Diluted (loss) earnings per share $ ( 312,321 ) 78,194 $ ( 3.99 ) $ 89,476 81,044 $ 1.10 $ 44,788 86,910 $ 0.52 In accordance with the Earnings Per Share Topic of the ASC, basic (loss) earnings per share is computed by dividing net (loss) income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period (excluding treasury stock and unvested restricted stock awards). Unvested restricted stock awards are eligible to receive dividends, if any; however, dividend rights will be forfeited if the award does not vest. Accordingly, only vested shares of formerly restricted stock are included in the calculation of basic (loss) earnings per share. The weighted average number of repurchased shares during the period, if any, which are held as treasury stock, are excluded from shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted (loss) earnings per share is determined using the treasury stock method based on the dilutive effect of certain unvested restricted stock awards and certain shares of common stock that are issuable upon exercise of stock options. During the year ended December 31, 2020, there were approximately 2,253,000 potentially dilutive shares of common stock excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share as their effect would have been anti-dilutive due to the Company’s net loss in the period. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were approximately 305,000 and 1,299,000 anti-dilutive shares of common stock excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share, respectively. The Company’s outstanding performance-vesting restricted stock awards are considered contingently issuable shares and are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share until the performance measure criteria is met as of the end of the reporting period. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, approximately 247,000 and 364,000 performance-vesting restricted stock awards had met their performance criteria for their respective performance years as of the end of the reporting periods, respectively, and are therefore included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share.

On March 10, 2020, SEA entered into an amendment, Amendment No. 10 (the “Amendment No. 10”) to its Amended Credit Agreement. Pursuant to Amendment No. 10, SEA increased the revolving credit commitments available under the Amended Credit Agreement from $ 210.0 million to an aggregate of $ 332.5 million. On April 19, 2020 and on July 29, 2020, respectively, SEA entered into Amendment No. 11, (the “Amendment No. 11”) and Amendment No. 12, (the “Amendment No. 12”) to its Amended Credit Agreement to amend certain provisions therein. On October 31, 2018, SEA entered into a refinancing amendment, Amendment No. 9 (the “Amendment No. 9”), to its Amended Credit Agreement. In connection with Amendment No. 9, SEA borrowed $ 543.9 million of additional term loans (the “Term B-5 Loans”) of which the proceeds, along with cash on hand, were used to redeem all of the then outstanding principal of the Term B-2 loans, and pay other fees, costs and expenses in connection with Amendment No. 9 and related transactions. Additionally, pursuant to Amendment No. 9, SEA terminated the then existing revolving credit commitments and replaced them with a new tranche of revolving credit commitments with an aggregate commitment amount of $ 210.0 million (the “Revolving Credit Facility”).

The Term B-5 Loans amortize in equal quarterly installments in aggregate annual amounts equal to 1.015 % of the original principal amount of the Term B-5 Loans outstanding on October 31, 2018, with the balance payable on the final maturity date. SEA may voluntarily repay amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities at any time without premium or penalty, other than customary “breakage” costs with respect to LIBOR loans. SEA is also required to prepay the outstanding Term B-5 Loans, subject to certain exceptions, under certain circumstances, as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. There were no mandatory prepayments made during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. The obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities are fully, unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by the Company, any subsidiary of the Company that directly or indirectly owns 100 % of the issued and outstanding equity interests of SEA, and, subject to certain exceptions, each of SEA’s existing and future material domestic wholly-owned subsidiaries.

All of the net assets of SEA and its consolidated subsidiaries are restricted and there are no unconsolidated subsidiaries of SEA. The Revolving Credit Facility requires that the Company comply with a springing maximum first lien secured leverage ratio of 6.25 x to be tested as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, solely to the extent that on such date the aggregate amount of funded loans and letters of credit (excluding undrawn letters of credit in an amount not to exceed $ 30.0 million and cash collateralized letters of credit) under the Revolving Credit Facility exceeds an amount equal to 35 % of the then outstanding commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility. Pursuant to Amendment No. 12, among other terms, SEA will be exempt from complying with its first lien secured leverage ratio covenant through the end of 2021, after which SEA will be required to comply with such covenant starting in the first quarter of 2022. For purposes of calculating compliance with such covenant, unless a Triggering Event occurs (as defined in Amendment No. 12), beginning with the first quarter of 2022, to the extent trailing Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in Amendment No. 12) for the second, third or fourth quarters of 2021 would have otherwise been included in the calculation of such covenant, in lieu of using actual Adjusted EBITDA for such periods, Adjusted EBITDA for such applicable periods will be deemed to be actual Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in Amendment No. 12) for the corresponding quarter of 2019. In addition, SEA will be required to comply with a quarterly minimum liquidity test (defined as unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and available commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility) of not less than $ 75.0 million until the earlier of September 30, 2022 or the date on which the Company elects to use the actual Adjusted EBITDA for purposes of calculating its financial maintenance covenant.

See Note 10–Other Accrued Liabilities for accrued interest included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. 12. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Risk Management Objective of Using Derivatives The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources and duration of its debt funding and at times through the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the Company has previously entered into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. The Company’s derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing and duration of the Company’s known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to the Company’s borrowings. The Company does not speculate using derivative instruments. In May 2020, the Company’s Interest Rate Swap Agreements expired, as such, the Company did no t have any derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2019, the Company did no t have any derivatives outstanding that were not designated in hedge accounting relationships. Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk The Company’s objectives in using interest rate derivatives were to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily used interest rate swaps at times as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, such derivatives were used to hedge a portion of the variable cash flows associated with existing variable-rate debt. The Interest Rate Swap Agreements were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk. The changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and were subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affected earnings. Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to derivatives were reclassified to interest expense as interest payments were made on the Company’s variable-rate debt. Tabular Disclosure of Fair Values of Derivative Instruments on the Balance Sheet The Company did not have any derivative financial instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2020. The table below presents the fair value of the Company’s derivative financial instruments as well as their classification in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019: Liability Derivatives As of December 31, 2019 Balance Sheet Location Fair Value Derivatives designated as hedging instruments: (In thousands) Interest rate swap agreements Other liabilities 2,156 Total derivatives designated as hedging instruments $ 2,156 F-25 Derivative instruments are valued according to the methodology outlined in Note 2–Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. The Company determined that its derivatives fell within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as discussed in Note–16 Fair Value Measurements. The unrealized gain or loss on derivatives was recorded net of tax expense of $ 0.5 million and a tax benefit of $ 1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and is included in the accompanying consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ (deficit) equity and the consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. Tabular Disclosure of the Effect of Derivative Instruments on the Statements of Comprehensive (Loss) Income The table below presents the pre-tax effect of the Company’s derivative financial instruments in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019: 2020 2019 (In thousands) Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships: (Loss) gain recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss $ ( 370 ) $ ( 5,247 ) Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to interest expense $ 2,501 $ ( 17 ) Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) The following table reflects the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019: Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (In thousands): (Losses) Gains on Cash Flow Hedges Accumulated other comprehensive income at December 31, 2018 2,284 Other comprehensive loss before reclassifications ( 3,831 ) Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to interest expense ( 12 ) Change in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax ( 3,843 ) Accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31, 2019 ( 1,559 ) Other comprehensive loss before reclassifications ( 271 ) Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense 1,830 Change in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax 1,559 Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at December 31, 2020 $ — 13. INCOME TAXES For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the (benefit from) provision for income taxes is comprised of the following: 2020 2019 2018 Current income tax provision (In thousands) Federal $ ( 136 ) $ ( 77 ) $ ( 99 ) State 1,020 1,580 1,113 Foreign 5 27 7 Total current income tax provision 889 1,530 1,021 Deferred income tax (benefit) provision: Federal ( 19,718 ) 21,825 13,019 State ( 11,696 ) 16,173 3,875 Total deferred income tax (benefit) provision ( 31,414 ) 37,998 16,894 Total income tax (benefit) provision $ ( 30,525 ) $ 39,528 $ 17,915 The deferred income tax (benefit) provision represents the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Cash paid for income taxes totaled $ 0.5 million, $ 1.4 million and $ 0.8 million, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. F-26 The components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows: 2020 2019 Deferred income tax assets: (In thousands) Acquisition and debt related costs $ 4,128 $ 5,550 Net operating losses 272,943 180,693 Goodwill impairment 53,887 54,271 Self-insurance 7,410 7,308 Deferred revenue 5,707 2,546 Cash flow hedge — 571 Restricted stock 2,826 4,411 Tax credits 10,577 10,230 Legal settlements 645 8,590 Lease obligations 29,943 32,078 Interest limitation 463 — Other 6,061 5,200 Total deferred income tax assets 394,590 311,448 Valuation allowance ( 65,617 ) ( 5,216 ) Net deferred tax assets 328,973 306,232 Deferred income tax liabilities: Property and equipment ( 211,729 ) ( 225,827 ) Amortization - Goodwill ( 51,435 ) ( 46,688 ) Amortization - Other intangibles ( 26,080 ) ( 22,979 ) Right of use assets ( 29,631 ) ( 31,940 ) Other ( 3,023 ) ( 2,558 ) Total deferred income tax liabilities ( 321,898 ) ( 329,992 ) Net deferred income tax assets (liabilities) $ 7,075 $ ( 23,760 ) The Company files federal, state and provincial income tax returns in various jurisdictions with varying statute of limitation expiration dates. Under the tax statute of limitations applicable to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations by the Internal Revenue Service for years before 2016. However, because the Company is carrying forward income tax attributes, such as net operating losses and tax credits from 2009 and subsequent years, these attributes can still be audited when utilized on returns filed in the future. The Company has determined that there are no positions currently taken that would rise to a level requiring an amount to be recorded or disclosed as an unrecognized tax benefit. If such positions do arise, it is the Company’s intent that any interest or penalty amount related to such positions will be recorded as a component of the income tax provision in the applicable period. The Company has federal tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $ 1.0 billion as of December 31, 2020 and state net operating loss carryforwards spread across various jurisdictions with a combined total of approximately $ 1.2 billion as of December 31, 2020. These net operating loss carryforwards, if not used to reduce taxable income in future periods, will begin to expire in 2029 , for both federal and state tax purposes. Realization of the deferred income tax assets, primarily arising from these net operating loss carryforwards and charitable contribution carryforwards, is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the carryforwards, which may include the reversal of deferred tax liability components. The Company believes it is more likely than not that some of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. Therefore, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance of approximately $ 39.5 million for federal net operating loss carryforwards, approximately $ 7.1 million for federal tax credits and approximately $ 4.0 million for federal and state charitable contributions as of December 31, 2020. Separately, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance of approximately $ 15.0 million and $ 5.2 million, net of federal tax benefit, on the deferred tax assets related to state net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company’s valuation allowances, in part, rely on estimates and assumptions related to future financial performance. Given the macroeconomic environment related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the uncertainties regarding the related impact on financial performance, the Company’s valuation allowances may need to be adjusted in the future. F-27 The reconciliation between the statutory income tax rate and the Company’s effective income tax provision (benefit) rate for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, is as follows: 2020 2019 2018 Amount % Amount % Amount % (In thousands) Income tax at federal statutory rates $ ( 71,998 ) 21.00 % $ 27,091 21.00 % $ 13,167 21.00 % State taxes, net of federal benefit ( 15,816 ) 4.61 7,645 5.93 4,640 7.40 Equity-based compensation ( 485 ) 0.14 ( 1,776 ) ( 1.38 ) 668 1.07 Tax credits ( 304 ) 0.09 ( 795 ) ( 0.62 ) ( 1,221 ) ( 1.95 ) Impact of state rate changes ( 3,906 ) 1.14 3,770 2.92 ( 379 ) ( 0.60 ) Nondeductible settlement — — — — 840 1.34 Valuation allowance - state 10,450 ( 3.05 ) 2,455 1.90 — — Valuation allowance - federal 49,951 ( 14.57 ) — — — — Other 1,583 ( 0.46 ) 1,138 0.89 200 0.31 Income tax (benefit) provision $ ( 30,525 ) 8.90 % $ 39,528 30.64 % $ 17,915 28.57 % 14. LEASES The Company leases land, warehouse and office space, and equipment, which are classified as either operating or finance leases. The Company’s most significant lease is a long-term land lease with the City of San Diego covering approximately 190 acres, including approximately 17 acres of water in Mission Bay Park, California (the “Premises”). While there are no financial restrictions or covenants imposed by the Premises lease, there are certain operational restrictions in that the Premises must be used as a marine park facility and the Company may not operate another marine park facility within 560 miles of the City of San Diego. The lease term for the Premises ends in June 2048 and the annual rent under the lease is variable and calculated on the basis of a specified percentage of the Company’s gross income from the Premises, (the “Percentage Rent”), or the minimum yearly rent (the “Minimum Rent”), whichever is greater. The required annual rent payments for the Premises is adjusted every three years to an amount equal to 80 % of the average accounting year rent actually paid for the three previous years, with the annual minimum rent calculated as $ 10.4 million through each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The annual rent payments may vary from the base rent due to a shift of seasonal performance results. Rent payments related to the Premises for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were approximately $ 0.5 million, $ 10.5 million and $ 11.2 million, respectively. The Company’s gross income from the Premises was significantly impacted during the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the temporary park closures, limited reopenings, modified operations and capacity restrictions resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related government restrictions in San Diego. As a result, the Company deferred $ 1.6 million of the Percentage Rent related to the year ended December 31, 2020, and an additional $ 8.3 million related to the Minimum Rent for the year ended December 31, 2020. As such, approximately $ 9.9 million is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 related to this lease. Operating lease liabilities and long-term operating lease liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 and the lease maturities as of December 31, 2020 are not adjusted for these deferred payments. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, the Company remitted the amounts owed for Percentage Rent of approximately $ 1.6 million.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company has commenced construction of certain new theme park attractions and other projects under contracts with various third parties. At December 31, 2020, excluding certain amounts related to the License Agreement with Sesame Workshop as described below, additional capital payments of approximately $ 72.0 million are necessary to complete these projects. The majority of these projects are expected to be completed in 2021 or 2022. License Agreements Pursuant to a license agreement (“License Agreement”) with Sesame Workshop, the Company pays a specified annual license fee, as well as a specified royalty based on revenues earned in connection with sales of licensed products, all food and beverage items utilizing the licensed elements and any events utilizing such elements if a separate fee is paid for such event. The Company’s principal commitments pursuant to the License Agreement include, among other items, the opening of a second stand-alone park (“Standalone Park”) no later than mid-2021 and minimum annual capital and marketing thresholds. After the opening of the second Standalone Park (counting the existing Sesame Place Standalone Park in Langhorne, Pennsylvania), the Company will have the option to build additional Standalone Parks in the defined territory within agreed upon timelines. The License Agreement has an initial term through December 31, 2031, with an automatic additional 15-year extension plus a five year option added to the term of the License Agreement from December 31st of the year of each new Standalone Park opening. As of December 31, 2020, the Company estimates the combined remaining obligations for the License Agreement commitments could be up to approximately $ 45.0 million over the remaining term of the agreement. In October 2019, the Company announced that it will convert Aquatica San Diego into its second Sesame Place Standalone Park in the spring of 2021. While construction began in the fall of 2019, it was temporarily paused due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company currently expects to open this park in 2022. As a result, depending on governmental restrictions in the state of California, the Company expects to reopen its Aquatica San Diego park in 2021 for its operating season. ABI has granted the Company a perpetual, exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use the Busch Gardens trademark and certain related domain names in connection with the operation, marketing, promotion and advertising of certain of the Company’s theme parks, as well as in connection with the production, use, distribution and sale of merchandise sold in connection with such theme parks. Under the license, the Company is required to indemnify ABI against losses related to the use of the marks. Legal Proceedings Securities Class Action Lawsuits The Company received final court approval of settlement of a purported stockholder class action lawsuit consisting of purchasers of the Company’s common stock during the periods between April 18, 2013 and August 13, 2014, captioned Baker v. SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc., et al., Case No. 14-CV-02129-MMA (KSC). The settlement required the Company to pay $ 65.0 million for F-30 claims alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as the costs of administration and legal fees and expenses. The settlement does not include or constitute an admission, concession, or finding of any fault, liability, or wrongdoing by the Company or any defendant. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded $ 32.1 million of legal settlement charges, net of insurance recoveries, related to this case. The full settlement amount was funded during the year ended December 31, 2020. On June 14, 2018, a lawsuit captioned Highfields Capital I LP et al v. SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. et al, Case No. 3:18-cv-01276-L-BLM, was filed in the United States District Court in the Southern District of California against the Company and certain of the Company’s former and present executive officers. The plaintiffs, which are investment funds managed by a common adviser allege, among other things, that the Defendants made false and misleading statements in violation of the federal securities laws and Florida common law, regarding the impact of the film Blackfish on SeaWorld’s business. The complaint further alleges that such statements were made to induce Plaintiffs to purchase common stock of the Company at artificially-inflated prices and that Plaintiffs suffered investment losses as a result. The Plaintiffs have indicated to the Company they believe the damages are in the range of $ 30 million to $ 35 million before considering interest. On October 19, 2018, Defendants moved for partial dismissal of the complaint. On February 7, 2019, the Court granted Defendants’ motion and dismissed Plaintiffs’ Florida state law claims as well as federal securities law claims based on the Company’s second quarter 2013 earnings statements. On May 1, 2019, Defendants filed their answer to Plaintiffs’ complaint. The parties are in the process of completing discovery and will then have the opportunity to file any summary judgment motions per a scheduling order the Court issued which contemplates briefing into the summer and the fall. The Company believes that the lawsuit is without merit and intends to defend the lawsuit vigorously. While there can be no assurance regarding the ultimate outcome of this lawsuit , the Company believes that any potential loss would not be material. Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit The Company received final court approval of a settlement of a putative derivative lawsuit captioned Kistenmacher v. Atchison, et al., Civil Action No. 10437 that was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware against, among others, the then Chairman of the Company’s Board, certain of the Company’s executive officers, directors and shareholders, and Blackstone. The Company was a “Nominal Defendant” in the lawsuit. Pursuant to the settlement, the Company received $ 12.5 million of insurance proceeds from its insurers and adopted certain corporate governance modifications. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a legal settlement gain of $ 12.5 million related to insurance proceeds received in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. Consumer Lawsuit On April 13, 2015, a purported class action was filed in the Superior Court of the State of California for the City and County of San Francisco against SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc., captioned Marc Anderson, et. al., v. SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc. Civil Case No. 15-cv-02172-JSW. The putative class consisted of all consumers within California who, within the past four years, purchased tickets to SeaWorld San Diego. The complaint (as amended) alleged causes of action under the California False Advertising Law, California Unfair Competition Law and California CLRA. The complaint sought restitution, equitable relief, attorneys’ fees and costs. The case was dismissed and refiled in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiffs did not file a motion for class certification. The case was prosecuted by certain plaintiffs for individual restitution in a nominal amount and injunctive relief. The Court bifurcated the trial of the case into two phases: the plaintiffs’ standing to sue and the merits of their claims. Before the first phase of the trial, plaintiff Anderson dismissed all claims against the Company. The standing trial with regard to the remaining plaintiffs took place in March of 2020. On October 13, 2020, the Court ruled that the remaining plaintiffs have no standing to sue and judgment was entered in favor of the Company. Plaintiffs have elected not to appeal this decision and the time to do so has passed. Other lawsuits On or about October 9, 2018, the Company received a demand letter from attorneys representing 19 former employees who claim that the terms of their respective separation agreements entitle them to certain favorable modifications made to certain performance-vesting restricted shares issued under the Company’s 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Plan”). The parties attended non-binding mediation on October 27, 2020. The claims were not resolved. On November 9, 2020, the Company filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware an action for declaratory judgment seeking a declaration that the threatened claims of the former employees are time-barred and without merit. In response, the defendant former employees filed a motion to dismiss or in the alternative to stay and compel arbitration. The parties are currently discussing participation in an arbitration. In terms of potential exposure, the value of the total shares at issue for these 19 former employees depends largely upon the Company’s current share price, which fluctuates daily. Approximately 300,000 shares are at issue. The Company believes that the former employees’ claims are without merit and intends to defend vigorously its positions. While there can be no assurance regarding the ultimate outcome of this matter, the Company believes that any potential loss would not be material. F-31 Other Matters The Company is a party to various other claims and legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business. In addition, from time to time the Company is subject to audits, inspections and investigations by, or receives requests for information from, various federal and state regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”), the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“Cal-OSHA”), the Florida Fish & Wildlife Commission (“FWC”), the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”), the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). In September 2018, the Company reached a settlement with the SEC relating to a previously disclosed SEC investigation. In connection with the settlement, without admitting or denying the substantive allegations in the SEC’s complaint, the Company agreed to the entry of a final judgment ordering the Company to pay a civil penalty of $ 4.0 million and enjoining the Company from violation of certain provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and certain rules thereunder. The settlement is recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 in the Company’s consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. Other than those matters discussed above, from time to time, various parties also bring other lawsuits against the Company. Matters where an unfavorable outcome to the Company is probable and which can be reasonably estimated are accrued. Such accruals, which are not material for any period presented, are based on information known about the matters, the Company’s estimate of the outcomes of such matters, and the Company’s experience in contesting, litigating and settling similar matters. Matters that are considered reasonably possible to result in a material loss are not accrued for, but an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss is disclosed, if such amount or range can be determined. At this time, management does not expect any such known claims, legal proceedings or regulatory matters to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 16. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Company has determined that of its long-term obligations, the Term B-5 Loans are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the Senior Notes and Second-Priority Senior Notes are classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2020. The fair value of the Term B-5 Loans approximate their carrying value, excluding unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts, due to the variable nature of the underlying interest rates and the frequent intervals at which such interest rates are reset. The fair value of the Senior Notes and Second-Priority Senior Notes was determined using quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments. See Note 11–Long-Term Debt. The Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivative financial instruments using the income approach fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company uses readily available market data to value its derivatives, such as interest rate curves and discount factors. ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement also requires consideration of credit risk in the valuation. The Company uses a potential future exposure model to estimate this credit valuation adjustment (“CVA”). The inputs to the CVA are largely based on observable market data, with the exception of certain assumptions regarding credit worthiness which make the CVA a Level 3 input. Based on the magnitude of the CVA, it was not considered a significant input and the derivatives were classified as Level 2 as of December 31, 2019. The Company did no t have any derivative financial instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2020. See Note 12 – Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The Company did no t have any assets measured on a recurring basis at fair value at December 31, 2020. The following table presents the Company’s estimated fair value measurements and related classifications for liabilities measured on a recurring basis at fair or carrying value as of December 31, 2020: Quoted Prices in Active Markets Significant for Identical Other Significant Assets and Observable Unobservable Balance at Liabilities Inputs Inputs December 31, (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) 2020 Liabilities: (In thousands) Long-term obligations (a) $ 787,975 $ 1,492,378 $ — $ 2,280,353 ( a ) F-32 Reflected at carrying value, net of unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts, in the consolidated balance sheet as current maturities of long-term debt of $ 15.5 million and long-term debt of $ 2.177 billion as of December 31, 2020 . The Company did no t have any assets measured on a recurring basis at fair value at December 31, 2019.

RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS ZHG Transaction As previously disclosed, Sun Wise (UK) Co., LTD., an affiliate to the ZHG Group (“Sun Wise”), previously held beneficial ownership of 19,452,063 shares (the “Pledged Shares”) of the Company’s common stock, which Sun Wise pledged in connection with certain loan obligations of Sun Wise. Sun Wise subsequently defaulted on such loan obligations and, as a result, certain of its lenders (together, the “Lenders”) foreclosed on the Pledged Shares. The Pledged Shares were transferred to a security agent for the Lenders (the “Security Agent”), on May 3, 2019. On May 27, 2019, the Security Agent entered into a share repurchase agreement with the Company pursuant to which the Security Agent agreed to sell and the Company agreed to purchase 5,615,874 of the Pledged Shares held by the Security Agent at a price per share equal to $ 26.71 (the “SEAS Repurchase”) for a total cost of approximately $ 150.0 million. The SEAS Repurchase closed on May 30, 2019 . Also on May 27, 2019, the Security Agent also entered into a stock purchase agreement with Hill Path Capital LP (“Hill Path”) and certain of its affiliates pursuant to which the Security Agent agreed to sell and certain affiliates of Hill Path agreed to purchase, in the aggregate, 13,214,000 of the Pledged Shares held by the Security Agent at a price per share equal to $ 26.71 (the “HP Purchase”). The purchase closed on May 30, 2019 , at which time, Hill Path’s ownership percentage increased to 34.6 %. See Note 20 – Stockholders’ (Deficit) Equity for further details. ZHG Agreements As discussed in Note 4–Revenues, in March 2017, the Company entered into the ZHG Agreements. In April 2019, the Company terminated the ZHG Agreements for non-payment of undisputed amounts owed. See Note 4–Revenues for further details including amounts recorded as revenue related to the ZHG Agreements. Hill Path Capital LP Agreements On May 27, 2019, in connection with the HP Purchase, the Company concurrently entered into a stockholders agreement, a registration rights and the Amended and Restated Undertaking Agreement with Hill Path (collectively, the “HP Agreements”). Under the HP Agreements, the Company agreed to appoint up to three Hill Path director designees to its Board and Hill Path agreed to certain customary standstill obligations, restrictions regarding the manner of sale of shares, and equal treatment for any change in control transaction. In addition, Hill Path agreed that shares held in excess of 24.9 % generally would be voted consistent with the Board’s recommendations or consistent with the shares voted by the Company’s other stockholders. The Company also agreed to reimburse Hill Path for up to $ 250,000 of their expenses in connection with the HP Agreements. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company reimbursed Hill Path for $ 250,000 in expenses incurred. F-33 18. RETIREMENT PLAN The Company sponsors a defined contribution plan, under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. During 2019 and 2018, the plan was a qualified automatic contributions arrangement, which automatically enrolled employees, once eligible, unless they opted out. Effective January 1, 2020, the plan removed the automatic contributions arrangement. Through December 31, 2019, the Company made matching cash contributions subject to certain restrictions, structured as a 100 % match on the first 1 % contributed by the employee and a 50 % match on the next 5 % contributed by the employee. Effective January 1, 2020, the plan amended the matching cash contributions structure going forward to be a 50 % match on the first 4 % of eligible pay contributed by the employee. In April 2020, the Company matching contribution was temporarily suspended in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Employer matching contributions for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, totaled $ 1.3 million, $ 7.5 million and $ 7.6 million, respectively, and is included in selling, general and administrative expenses and in operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. 19. EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION Equity compensation expense is included in operating expenses and in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income as follows: For the Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 (In thousands) Equity compensation expense included in operating expenses $ 522 $ 4,076 $ 7,387 Equity compensation expense included in selling, general and administrative expenses 6,945 7,030 14,765 Total equity compensation expense $ 7,467 $ 11,106 $ 22,152 Equity compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2020, includes the reversal of expense related to certain performance vesting restricted units which were no longer considered probable of vesting and also includes the reversal of expense related to outstanding unvested equity awards previously held by the Company’s former chief executive officer which were forfeited in connection with his departure. See Previous Long-term Incentive Awards section which follows for further details. Equity compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2018, includes approximately $ 5.5 million related to equity awards which were accelerated to vest in connection with the departure of certain executives as required by their respective employment agreements (see Note 21–Severance and Other Separation Costs for further details). Total unrecognized equity compensation expense for all equity compensation awards probable of vesting as of December 31, 2020 was approximately $ 16.3 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.1 years. The total fair value of shares which vested during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $ 12.7 million, $ 9.7 million and $ 12.1 million, respectively. The weighted average grant date fair value per share of time-vesting and performance-vesting restricted awards granted during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $ 15.85 , $ 26.55 and $ 15.40 per share, respectively. The activity related to the Company’s time-vesting and performance-vesting restricted awards during the year ended December 31, 2020 was as follows: Performance-Vesting Restricted Awards Time-Vesting Restricted Awards Bonus Performance Restricted Awards Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Awards Shares/Units Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value per Award Shares/Units Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value per Award Shares/Units Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value per Award Outstanding at December 31, 2019 725,911 $ 21.08 333,673 $ 26.10 1,855,828 $ 22.34 Granted 1,476,758 $ 12.99 — $ — 246,374 $ 33.23 Vested ( 432,497 ) $ 20.18 ( 97,616 ) $ 26.11 ( 79,173 ) $ 17.55 Forfeited ( 77,593 ) $ 22.71 ( 212,759 ) $ 26.09 ( 555,393 ) $ 25.11 Outstanding at December 31, 2020 1,692,579 $ 14.18 23,298 $ 26.16 1,467,636 $ 23.38 F-34 The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $ 1.3 million, $ 2.4 million and $ 1.7 million, respectively. The activity related to the Company’s stock option awards during the year ended December 31, 2020 was as follows: Options Weighted Average Exercise Price Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Life (in years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in thousands) Outstanding at December 31, 2019 914,022 $ 22.43 Granted 128,434 $ 20.79 Forfeited ( 184,059 ) $ 28.38 Expired ( 20,785 ) $ 19.11 Exercised ( 157,624 ) $ 18.53 Outstanding at December 31, 2020 679,988 $ 21.51 6.89 $ 6,860 Exercisable at December 31, 2020 392,671 $ 19.82 5.53 $ 4,622 The weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $ 9.69 . Key weighted-average assumptions utilized in the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model for stock options granted during the year ended December 31, 2020 were: Risk-free interest rate 0.61 % Expected volatility 51.37 % Expected dividend yield 0.00 % Expected life (years) ( a ) 5.90 ( a ) The expected life was estimated using the simplified method, as the Company does not have sufficient historical exercise data due to the limited period of time its common stock has been publicly traded. Omnibus Incentive Plan The Company has reserved 15,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the Company’s Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Omnibus Incentive Plan”), of which approximately 7,680,000 are available for future issuance as of December 31, 2020. Bonus Performance Restricted Awards Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related temporary park closures, the Company did not adopt an annual bonus plan for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company had an annual bonus plan for the year ended December 31, 2019 (the “Fiscal 2019”), under which certain employees were eligible to vest in performance-vesting restricted units based upon the Company’s achievement of specified performance goals with respect to Fiscal 2019. Based on the Company’s actual Fiscal 2019 results, a portion of these units vested in the year ended December 31, 2020 and the remainder forfeited in accordance with their terms. Separately, on October 3, 2019, in connection with its regular review of compensation matters, the Compensation Committee of the Board, approved certain equity awards designed to recognize employees for their contribution and continued expected contribution to the Company and its goals. A portion of these awards were in the form of performance-vesting restricted units which were eligible to vest based on achievement of specific performance goals with respect to Fiscal 2019. Based on the Company’s actual Fiscal 2019 results, a portion of these units vested in the first quarter of 2020, another portion will vest in the first quarter of 2021 based on the employee’s continued employment on such vesting date and the remainder forfeited in accordance with their terms. 2020 Long-Term Incentive Awards During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company granted long-term incentive plan awards to certain employees. These grants were comprised of nonqualified stock options (the “Long-Term Incentive Options”) and performance-vesting restricted units (the “Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Units”). The nonqualified stock options generally vest ratably over two or three years , subject to continued employment through the applicable vesting date. Equity compensation expense for these options is recognized for each tranche over the vesting period using the straight-line method. Upon stock option exercises, authorized but unissued shares are issued by the Company. The performance-vesting restricted units granted in 2020 contain a performance period through calendar year 2022 (or, the end of the 2023 calendar year, as applicable), and are otherwise consistent with the terms of the modified 2019 LTIP Performance Awards as discussed further below. Equity compensation expense has not yet been recorded related to these awards. F-35 Other Long-Term Incentive Awards During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company also granted time-vesting restricted units to certain employees which generally vest over three years , with one-third vesting on each anniversary of the date of grant, subject to continued employment through the applicable vesting date. Separately, during the year ended December 31, 2020, in connection with a review of compensation matters, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved grants of approximately 1.2 million restricted stock units designed to recognize certain employees for their contributions and continued expected contributions to the Company and its long term goals during the COVID-19 pandemic. The restricted stock units will vest 50 % on each of the first two anniversaries of the grant date, subject to the recipient’s continued employment on each such vesting date. Previous Long-Term Incentive Awards The Company also has outstanding time-vesting restricted awards (the “Long-Term Incentive Time Restricted Awards”), performance-vesting restricted awards (the “Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Awards”) and nonqualified stock options granted under previous long-term incentive plan grants. During the year ended December 31, 2020, a portion of the previously granted Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Awards related to completed performance periods vested, with the remainder forfeiting in accordance with their terms. The remaining outstanding Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Awards related to future performance periods are eligible to vest based upon the Company’s achievement of pre-established performance goals for the respective performance period, as defined. Based on the Company’s actual results for 2020, the previously granted Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Awards related to the performance period which ended on December 31, 2020 are expected to forfeit in the first quarter of 2021. The Company previously granted long-term incentive performance restricted units in 2019 (the “2019 LTIP Performance Awards”) which contained a three-year performance period consisting of the 2019-2021 calendar years (or, extended through the end of the 2022 calendar year, as applicable) and were eligible to vest based upon the Company’s achievement of specific performance goals for the performance period, as defined. The total number of 2019 LTIP Performance Awards eligible to vest will be based on the level of achievement of the performance goals and ranges from 0 % (if below threshold performance) up to 100 % (for target or above performance). Upon achievement of the performance goals, only 50% of the award for a given level of performance will vest, with the remaining 50% subject to a one-year performance test period. The goal achieved must be met again or exceeded the next fiscal year before the remaining units are earned. In November 2019, certain performance-vesting restricted stock units were granted to the Company’s previous Chief Executive Officer (the “CEO Performance Awards”). The CEO Performance Awards had a three-year performance period consisting of the 2020-2022 calendar years (or, extended through the end of the 2023 calendar year, as applicable) which were eligible to vest based upon the Company’s achievement of specific performance goals for the performance period, as defined by the CEO Performance Awards. The performance period and the performance goals for the CEO Performance Awards differed from those of the 2019 LTIP Performance Awards, as such, o n February 25, 2020, the Board approved a modification (the “Modification”) to the 2019 LTIP Performance Awards in order to better align its terms with those of the CEO Performance Awards. The Compensation Committee of the Board determined that it was preferable to align the 2019 LTIP Performance Awards with the CEO Performance Awards to put everyone on the same performance cycle with the same performance goals. Pursuant to the Modification, the threshold and target performance goals were revised to align with the CEO Performance Awards threshold and target performance goals and the performance period was extended through calendar year 2022 (or, the end of the 2023 calendar year, as applicable) consistent with the CEO Performance Awards. Equity compensation expense has not yet been recorded related to these awards as the performance goals are not yet considered probable of achievement. The Company will use the respective modification date fair value to record equity compensation expense related to the Modification awards when and if they become probable of vesting in a future period, in accordance with the guidance in ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation . F-36 Other During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company granted equity awards to its non-employee members of its Board which will vest on the day before the Company’s next annual meeting. Each eligible Board member elected the form of their equity award as either deferred stock units (“DSUs”) or restricted stock units (“RSUs”). Each DSU granted in 2020 represents the right to receive one share of the Company’s common stock three months after the respective director leaves the Board. Upon vesting, each RSU will be converted into one share of the Company’s common stock. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company granted equity awards in the form of RSUs which vested immediately to each eligible Board member in lieu of quarterly cash payments related to the director’s annual retainers. 20. STOCKHOLDERS’ (DEFICIT) EQUITY As of December 31, 2020, 94,652,248 shares of common stock were issued in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, which includes 16,260,248 shares of treasury stock held by the Company (see Share Repurchase Program discussion below), but excludes 101,135 unvested shares of common stock and 3,082,378 unvested restricted stock units held by certain participants in the Company’s equity compensation plans (see Note 19–Equity-Based Compensation). Share Repurchase Program The Board had previously authorized the repurchase of up to $ 250.0 million of the Company’s common stock (the “Share Repurchase Program”). Under the Share Repurchase Program, the Company is authorized to repurchase shares through open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans and under Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. During the year ended December 31, 2020, prior to the COVID-19 temporary park closures, the Company completed a share repurchase of 469,785 shares for an aggregate total of approximately $ 12.4 million, leaving approximately $ 237.6 million available under the Share Repurchase Program as of December 31, 2020. In connection with Amendment No. 12 to the Company’s Amended Credit Agreement, the Company is restricted from paying any dividends or making restricted payments, including share repurchases, through the third quarter of 2022 unless certain conditions are met ( see Note 11–Long-Term Debt). During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company completed a share repurchase of 5,615,874 shares (see discussion relating to the SEAS Repurchase in Note 17–Related Party Transactions for further details). On August 2, 2019, the Company’s Board approved a replenishment to the Share Repurchase Program of $ 150.0 million, bringing the total amount authorized for future share repurchases back up to $ 250.0 million at that time. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company repurchased a total of 3,654,816 shares of common stock at a total cost of approximately $ 98.0 million. The Share Repurchase Program has no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued completely at any time. The number of shares to be purchased and the timing of purchases will be based on the Company’s trading windows and available liquidity, general business and market conditions, and other factors, including legal requirements, debt covenant restrictions and alternative investment opportunities. All shares repurchased pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program, along with shares repurchased directly from selling stockholders concurrently with previous secondary offerings, are recorded as treasury stock at a total cost of $ 415.3 million and $ 402.9 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are reflected as a reduction to stockholders’ (deficit) equity in the accompanying consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ (deficit) equity. 21. SEVERANCE AND OTHER SEPARATION COSTS In September 2020, the Company committed to a plan of termination (the “2020 Restructuring Program”) primarily impacting some of the Company’s previously furloughed salaried, full-time and part-time employees. Substantially all of the impacted employees were furloughed as part of the Company’s efforts to reduce operating expenses and adjust cash flows in light of business circumstances associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the sudden and unforeseeable economic impacts of the pandemic on the Company’s business operations, that were not reasonably foreseeable at the time of the temporary furloughs, the Company transitioned certain park and corporate personnel from a furloughed status to a permanent layoff. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded approximately $ 2.7 million in pre-tax restructuring charges primarily related to severance and other termination benefits related to the 2020 Restructuring Program, which is included in severance and other separation costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. Currently, some of the Company’s employees at certain parks remain on furlough. The Company continues to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and may adjust its plans accordingly. As of December 31, 2020, the remaining liability, which primarily relates to severance and other separation costs incurred as part of the 2020 Restructuring Program to be paid as contractually obligated by December 31, 2021, is included in accrued salaries, wages and benefits in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. F-37 The Company is committed to continuous improvement and regularly evaluates operations to ensure it is properly organized for performance and efficiency. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded approximately $ 4.2 million in pre-tax charges primarily consisting of severance and other termination benefits, which is included in severance and other separation costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. In August 2018, the Company announced a restructuring program (the “2018 Restructuring Program”) focused on reducing costs, improving operating margins and streamlining its management structure to create efficiencies and better align with its strategic business objectives. The 2018 Restructuring Program involved the elimination of approximately 125 positions during the third quarter of 2018 across the Company’s theme parks and its corporate headquarters. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded approximately $ 5.5 million in pre-tax restructuring charges primarily related to severance and other termination benefits, which is included in severance and other separation costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. The Company will not incur any additional costs associated with the 2018 Restructuring Program as all continuing service obligations were completed as of December 31, 2018. The 2020 and 2018 Restructuring Program activity for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was as follows: 2020 Restructuring Program 2018 Restructuring Program (In thousands) Liability as of December 31, 2018 $ — $ 537 Costs incurred — — Payments made — ( 537 ) Liability as of December 31, 2019 $ — $ — Costs incurred 2,658 — Payments made ( 2,513 ) — Liability as of December 31, 2020 $ 145 $ — Other Separation Costs Severance and other separation costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 also includes severance and other employment expenses for other positions not part of a larger restructuring program and includes certain executives who stepped down from their respective positions during 2018. In particular, on February 27, 2018, the Company announced that its President and Chief Executive Officer (the “Former CEO”) had stepped down from his position and resigned as a member of the Board. In connection with his departure, the Former CEO received a lump sum cash payment of approximately $ 6.7 million in severance-related benefits, in accordance with his employment agreement. Certain other executives who separated from the Company during the first half of 2018 also received severance-related benefits of approximately $ 3.8 million in accordance with the terms of their respective employment agreements or relevant company plan, as applicable. These severance expenses are included in severance and other separation costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income for the year ended December 31, 2018. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2018, certain equity awards were accelerated to vest in connection with the departure of specific executives as required by their respective employment agreements. As a result, the Company recorded incremental non-cash equity compensation expense related to these awards, which is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. See Note 19–Equity-Based Compensation for further details. F-38 Schedule I-Registrant’s Condensed Financial Statements SEAWORLD ENTERTAINMENT, INC.

F-41 SEAWORLD ENTERTAINMENT, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED PARENT COMPANY ONLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. DESCRIPTION OF SEAWORLD ENTERTAINMENT, INC. SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. (the “Parent”) was incorporated in Delaware on October 2, 2009. At that time, the Parent was owned by ten limited partnerships, ultimately owned by affiliates of The Blackstone Group L.P. (“Blackstone”) and certain co-investors. Parent completed an initial public offering in April 2013. In May 2017, an affiliate of Zhonghong Zhuoye Group Co., Ltd., Sun Wise (UK) Co., LTD. (“Sun Wise”) acquired approximately 21 % of the then outstanding shares of common stock of the Company (the “ZHG Transaction”) from certain affiliates of Blackstone. Subsequent to the ZHG Transaction, Blackstone did not own any remaining shares of the Company. See further discussion relating to subsequent ownership changes in Note 17–Related-Party Transactions in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The Parent has no operations or significant assets or liabilities other than its investment in SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc. (“SEA”), which owns and operates twelve theme parks within the United States. Accordingly, the Parent is dependent upon distributions from SEA to fund its obligations. However, under the terms of SEA’s various debt agreements, SEA’s ability to pay dividends or lend to the Parent is restricted, except that SEA may pay specified amounts to the Parent to fund the payment of the Parent’s tax obligations. The COVID-19 pandemic materially impacted operations for SEA for the year ended December 31, 2020. See further discussion relating to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Note 1–Description of the Business in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION The accompanying condensed financial statements (the “parent company only financial statements”) include the accounts of the Parent and its investment in SEA accounted for in accordance with the equity method and do not present the financial statements of the Parent and its subsidiary on a consolidated basis. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted since this information is included with the SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “consolidated financial statements”). These parent company only financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements. 3. GUARANTEES SEA is the borrower under the senior secured credit facilities, (the “Senior Secured Credit Facilities”) under a credit agreement (the “Amended Credit Agreement”) dated as of December 1, 2009, as the same may be amended, restated, supplemented or modified from time to time. On April 30, 2020, SEA closed on a private offering of $ 227.5 million aggregate principal amount of 8.750 % first-priority senior secured notes due 2025 (the “Senior Notes”). On August 5, 2020, SEA closed on a private offering of $ 500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9.500 % second-priority senior secured notes due 2025 (the “Second-Priority Senior Notes”). Under the terms of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the obligations of SEA are fully, unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by Parent, any subsidiary of Parent that directly or indirectly owns 100 % of the issued and outstanding equity interest of SEA, and subject to certain exceptions, each of SEA’s existing and future material domestic wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the “Guarantors”). The Senior Notes and Second-Priority Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Parent, any subsidiary of Parent that directly or indirectly owns 100 % of the issued and outstanding equity interests of SEA, and subject to certain exceptions, each of SEA’s subsidiaries that guarantees SEA’s existing senior secured credit facilities. See Note 11–Long-Term Debt of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further details . 4. DIVIDENDS FROM SUBSIDIARY During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, SEA paid dividends to the Parent of approximately $ 12.4 million, $ 150.0 million and $ 98.0 million, respectively. The dividends were in the form of payments that SEA made for share repurchases at the Parent level (see Note 5–Stockholders’ (Deficit) Equity which follows). During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, Parent paid accumulated dividends, net of forfeitures, related to shares that carried dividend rights from previous dividend declarations which vested during the respective year. F-42 5. STOCKHOLDERS’ (DEFICIT) EQUITY Omnibus Incentive Plan The Parent has reserved 15,000,000 shares of common stock for future issuance under the Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Omnibus Incentive Plan”), of which approximately 7,680,000 are available for future issuance as of December 31, 2020. The Omnibus Incentive Plan is administered by the compensation committee of the Parent’s Board, and provides that the Parent may grant equity incentive awards to eligible employees, directors, consultants or advisors of the Parent or its subsidiary, SEA, in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other stock-based and performance compensation awards. If an award under the Omnibus Incentive Plan expires or is canceled, forfeited, or terminated, without issuance to the participant, the unissued shares may be granted again under the Omnibus Incentive Plan. See further discussion in Note 19–Equity-Based Compensation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, Parent transferred approximately $ 2.6 million and $ 3.7 million in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options to SEA as a capital contribution and increased its investment in SEA. Share Repurchase Program The Parent’s Board previously authorized the repurchase of up to $ 250.0 million of the Company’s common stock (the “Share Repurchase Program”). Under the Share Repurchase Program, the Parent is authorized to repurchase shares through open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans and under Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. The Share Repurchase Program has no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued completely at any time. During the year ended December 31, 2020, prior to the COVID-19 temporary park closures, the Parent repurchased a total of 469,785 shares of common stock at a total cost of $ 12.4 million , leaving approximately $ 237.6 million available under the Share Repurchase Program as of December 31, 2020 . In connection with Amendment No. 12 to the SEA’s Amended Credit Agreement, the Parent is restricted from paying any dividends or making restricted payments, including share repurchases, through the third quarter of 2022 unless certain conditions are met. See further discussion in Note 11–Long-Term Debt of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Parent repurchased a total of 5,615,874 shares of common stock at a total cost of approximately $ 150.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Parent repurchased a total of 3,654,816 shares of common stock at a total cost of approximately $ 98.0 million. All shares repurchased pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program, along with shares repurchased directly from selling stockholders concurrently with previous secondary offerings, are recorded as treasury stock at a total cost of $ 415.3 million and $ 402.9 million as of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are reflected as a reduction to stockholders’ (deficit) equity in the accompanying condensed balance sheets.

Business Company Overview We are a leading theme park and entertainment company providing experiences that matter and inspiring guests to protect animals and the wild wonders of our world. We own or license a portfolio of recognized brands including SeaWorld, Busch Gardens, Aquatica, Discovery Cove, Sesame Place and Sea Rescue. Over our more than 60-year history, we have developed a diversified portfolio of 12 differentiated theme parks that are grouped in key markets across the United States. Many of our theme parks showcase our one-of-a-kind zoological collection and feature a diverse array of both thrill and family-friendly rides, educational presentations, shows and/or other attractions with broad demographic appeal which deliver memorable experiences and a strong value proposition for our guests. During 2019, we hosted approximately 22.6 million guests in our theme parks, generated total revenues of $1.40 billion and reported net income of $89.5 million. We generate revenue primarily from selling admission to our theme parks and from purchases of food, merchandise and other items, primarily within our theme parks. Theme park admissions accounted for approximately 57% of our total revenue, and food, merchandise and other revenue accounted for approximately 43% of our total revenue. For more information concerning our results from operations, see the “ Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As one of the world’s foremost zoological organizations and a global leader in animal welfare, training, husbandry, veterinary care and marine animal rescue, we are committed to helping protect and preserve the environment and the natural world. For more information, see the “—Our Culture and Social Responsibility” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Recent Developments Legal Settlements On February 11, 2020, we announced that we had entered into a settlement agreement with respect to a previously disclosed class action lawsuit commenced in 2014, captioned Baker v. SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc ., et al., Case No. 14-CV-02129-MMA (AGS) (“Baker”). The proposed settlement, which is subject to certain conditions, including court approval, requires us to pay $65.0 million for claims alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as the costs of administration and legal fees and expenses. The proposed settlement does not include or constitute an admission, concession, or finding of any fault, liability, or wrongdoing by us or any defendant. There can be no assurance that the proposed settlement agreement will be approved by the court. In addition, on February 11, 2020, we announced that we had entered into a binding agreement for the settlement of a previously disclosed putative derivative lawsuit commenced in 2014, captioned Kistenmacher v. Atchison, et al ., Civil Action No. 10437 (“Kistenmacher”), filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. Pursuant to the agreement, we received $12.5 million of insurance proceeds from our insurers which can be used for general corporate purposes and we will adopt certain corporate governance modifications. The final settlement of the matter remains subject to a formal agreement and court approval. There can be no assurance that the final settlement agreement will be executed or that such agreement will be approved by the court. In connection with the above two settlements, we expect to make a payment of $65.0 million related to the Baker case which we intend to fund as follows: (i) $32.9 million in insurance proceeds from our insurance carriers for the Baker case, (ii) $12.5 million of insurance proceeds from our insurance carriers related to the Kistenmacher case and (iii) $19.6 million from cash. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded $32.1 million of legal settlement charges, net of insurance recoveries, related to the Baker case, which is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Separately, in the first quarter of 2020, we expect to record a legal settlement gain of $12.5 million related to insurance proceeds received in the Kistenmacher case. For more details, refer to Note 15–Commitments and Contingencies in our notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Sesame Place On October 21, 2019, we announced that we will convert Aquatica San Diego into our second Sesame Place standalone park in the spring of 2021. While construction began in the fall of 2019, it is not expected to impact Aquatica San Diego’s operating schedule for the 2020 operating season. For more details, refer to Note 15–Commitments and Contingencies in our notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 3 Leadership Changes On November 7, 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors (the “Board”) appointed Sergio (“Serge”) D. Rivera to serve as our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”). In connection with the appointment of Mr. Rivera as CEO, Marc G. Swanson, who had been serving as our Interim Chief Executive Officer, resumed his previous role of Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer and Elizabeth C. Gulacsy, who had been serving as our Interim Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer in addition to her role as our Chief Accounting Officer, ceased serving as our Interim Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Ms. Gulacsy continues to serve as our Chief Accounting Officer. Our Competitive Strengths • Brands That Consumers Know and Love. We believe our brands attract and appeal to guests from around the world. We use our brands, intellectual property and the work we do to care for animals to increase awareness of our theme parks, drive attendance to our theme parks and create “out-of-park” experiences for our guests as a way to connect with them before they visit our theme parks and to stay connected with them after their visit. Such experiences include various consumer product offerings, including toys, books, apparel and technology accessories as well as our websites and advertisements. • Differentiated Theme Parks. We own and operate 12 theme parks which deliver high-quality educational experiences, entertainment offerings, aesthetic appeal, and shopping and dining experiences. Our portfolio includes theme parks ranked among the most highly attended in the industry, including three of the top 20 theme parks and four of the top 10 water parks in North America, as measured by attendance ( TEA/AECOM 2018 Report ). We have over 650 attractions that appeal to guests of all ages, including 88 animal habitats, 114 programs and 204 rides. In addition, we have over 350 restaurants, photo and specialty retail shops. Our theme parks appeal to the entire family and offer a broad range of experiences, ranging from educational animal encounters and presentations, to thrilling rides and exciting shows. In fact, we have won numerous awards and recognition as detailed in our theme park portfolio table located in the Our Theme Parks section which follows. As a result of our distinctive offerings and experiences, our guest surveys routinely report very high “Overall Satisfaction” scores, with 96% of respondents in 2019 ranking their experience good or excellent. • Diversified Business Portfolio. Our portfolio of theme parks is diversified in a number of important respects. Our theme parks are located in geographic clusters across the United States, which at times can help protect us from the impact of localized events. Many of our theme parks showcase a different mix of thrill-oriented and family friendly attractions including rides, educational presentations and/or shows. This varied portfolio of offerings attracts guests from a broad range of demographics and geographies. Our portfolio of theme parks appeal to both regional and destination guests, which provide us with a diversified attendance base. • One of the World’s Largest Zoological Collections. We provide care for what we believe is one of the world’s largest zoological collections. We believe we are attractively positioned in the industry due to our highly unique zoological collection and ability to present our animals in a differentiated and interactive manner. Through opportunities to explore and interact with these amazing animals in our parks, each year we educate millions of guests with the goal of inspiring them to care and protect animals and their habitats in the wild. Our commitment to these animals includes applying world-class standards of care while striving to provide habitats that promote their health. We also lead, partner with and/or sponsor research efforts that have provided and will continue to provide essential information and tools to help protect and sustain species in their natural habitats around the world. See the “— Conservation & Community Relations ” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. • Strong Competitive Position. Our competitive position is enhanced by the combination of our powerful brands, extensive zoological collection and expertise and attractive in-park assets located on valuable real estate. Our zoological collection and expertise, which have evolved over our six decades of caring for animals, would be extremely difficult and expensive to replicate. We have made extensive investments in new attractions and infrastructure and we believe that our theme parks are well capitalized (see the “— Capital Improvements” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of our new rides and attractions). We believe that the limited supply of real estate suitable for theme park development coupled with high initial capital investment, long development lead-times and zoning and other land use restrictions constrain the number of large theme parks that can be constructed. • Proven and Experienced Management Team and Employees with Specialized Animal Expertise. Our senior management team, currently led by Serge Rivera, Chief Executive Officer, have an average tenure of approximately 18 years in relevant industries. The management team is comprised of highly skilled and dedicated professionals with wide ranging experience in theme park operations, zoological operations, product and business development, hospitality, finance and accounting. Additionally, our animal care team is among the most experienced and qualified in the world, making us a global leader in animal welfare, husbandry, enrichment and veterinary care. 4 • Proximity of Complementary Theme Parks. Our theme parks are grouped in key locations near large population centers and/or tourism destinations across the United States, which allows us to realize revenue and operating expense efficiencies. Having complementary theme parks located within close proximity to each other also enables us to cross market and offer bundled ticket and vacation packages. In addition, closely located theme parks provide operating efficiencies including sales, marketing, procurement and administrative synergies as overhead expenses are shared among the theme parks within each region. • Significant Cash Flow Generation. We believe that our disciplined approach to capital expenditures, cost management and working capital management enables us to generate significant annual operating cash flow, even in years of declining performance. In addition, five of our 12 theme parks are open year-round, which helps reduce seasonal cash flow volatility. • Care for Our Community and the Natural World. We are committed to the communities in which our theme parks are located and focus our philanthropic efforts in three areas: animal preservation and stewardship; youth development and education; and community initiatives that address environmental sustainability. Our theme parks inspire and educate children and guests of all ages through experiences that are educational, fun and meaningful. Additionally, our Sesame Place park was the first theme park in the world to have achieved the designation of Certified Autism Center from the International Board of Credentialing and Continuing Education Standards (the “IBCCES”) and we have subsequently achieved the designation for three more of our theme parks, SeaWorld Orlando, Aquatica Orlando and Discovery Cove. We also partner with charities across the country whose values and missions are aligned with our own by providing financial support, in-kind resources, strategic guidance, and/or hands-on volunteer work. For example, we are the primary supporter and corporate member of the SeaWorld & Busch Gardens Conservation Fund, a non-profit conservation foundation, which makes grants to wildlife research and conservation projects that protect wildlife and wild places worldwide. In addition, we operate one of the world’s most respected rescue programs for ill and injured marine animals, in collaboration with federal, state and local governments, and other members of accredited stranding networks, among others, with the goal of rehabilitating and returning them to the wild. For more than five decades, our animal experts have helped more than 36,000 ill, injured, orphaned and abandoned wild animals. We are committed to animal rescue, conservation research and education and invest millions annually in these efforts. Our Theme Parks Our legacy started in 1959 with the opening of our first Busch Gardens theme park in Tampa, Florida. Since then, we have grown our portfolio of strong brands and strategically expanded across five states on approximately 2,000 acres of owned land and 190 acres of leased property in San Diego. Our theme parks offer guests a variety of exhilarating experiences, from animal encounters that invite exploration and appreciation of the natural world, to both thrilling and family-friendly rides, educational presentations and spectacular shows. Our theme parks are consistently recognized among the top theme parks in the world and rank among the most highly attended in the industry. We generally locate our theme parks in geographic clusters, which we believe improves our ability to serve guests by providing them with a varied, comprehensive vacation experience and valuable multi-park pricing packages, as well as improving our operating efficiency through shared overhead costs. Our portfolio of branded theme parks includes the following names (see the theme park portfolio table which follows for more details on each of these parks and a summary of our recent awards and recognition): • SeaWorld. SeaWorld is widely recognized as the leading marine-life theme park brand in the world. Our SeaWorld theme parks rank among the most highly attended theme parks in the industry and offer up-close interactive experiences, educational presentations, special dining experiences, thrilling attractions and a variety of educational and entertainment offerings that immerse guests in the marine-life theme. We also offer our guests numerous animal encounters, including the opportunity to work with trainers and feed marine animals, as well as themed thrill and family-friendly rides and entertainment that creatively incorporate our one-of-a-kind zoological collection. We currently own and operate the following SeaWorld-branded theme parks: • SeaWorld San Diego is the original SeaWorld theme park and was founded in 1964 by four graduates from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).

Capital Improvements We make annual targeted investments to support our existing theme park facilities and attractions, as well as enable the development of new theme park attractions and infrastructure. Maintaining and improving our theme parks, as well as opening new attractions, is critical to remain competitive, grow revenue and increase our guests’ length of stay. During 2020, we plan to introduce what we believe is the strongest line up of new rides and attractions in our history, including many one-of-a-kind, world-class rides. Almost every park will get a new ride, slide or attraction, including 5 of the 10 most anticipated roller coasters of 2020 ( USA Today, 2020 ). Some of the new rides and attractions planned for 2020 include: • Ice Breaker (SeaWorld Orlando): The first quadruple swing launch coaster in North America, featuring four airtime filled launches, both backwards and forwards, culminating in a reverse launch up a 93 foot vertical spike leading to the steepest beyond vertical drop in Florida. • Emperor (SeaWorld San Diego): The tallest, fastest, longest and first floorless dive coaster on the West Coast. After climbing more than 150 feet, the coaster car will dangle at a 45-degree angle before plunging into a 143-foot vertical drop that will accelerate riders to more than 60 miles per hour. • Texas Stingray (SeaWorld San Antonio): The tallest, fastest and longest wooden coaster in Texas and will feature a drop of 100 feet, a top speed of 55 miles per hour, and over 16 airtime hills. • Iron Gwazi (Busch Gardens Tampa Bay): The tallest hybrid coaster in North America and the world’s fastest and steepest hybrid coaster, with the world’s tallest drop. Riders will climb more than 200 feet before plunging into a beyond vertical drop, reaching speeds of 76 miles per hour, and experiencing a dozen airtime moments. • Pantheon (Busch Gardens Williamsburg): The world’s fastest multi-launch coaster, will accelerate riders to a speed of 73 miles per hour and will include a 95-degree drop, four launches, two inversions, 15 air-time moments and a height of 180 feet. • Riptide Race (Aquatica Orlando): The first dueling pipeline slide in the state of Florida that will send riders racing through nearly 650 feet of slide all while navigating tight turns and accelerations alongside their opponents. • Solar Vortex (Adventure Island): The first dual tailspin waterslide in North America. This family raft slide combines high-banking rotations and rapid descents sending sliders on a swirling journey through two open tailspin features. • Tonga Twister (Aquatica San Antonio): The first of its kind in Texas, guests will enjoy two thrilling body slides, with 350 feet of twisting and turning through tubes with special effect lighting patterns and high-energy music, giving riders an electrifying light and sound show. • Aquazoid “Supercharged” (Water Country USA): The first of its kind in Virginia, this new water slide experience will take guests in rafts through 59 fully enclosed color changing rings with dynamic sound spread over 219 feet of slide, providing a new thrill each time you ride. • Big Bird’s Tour Bus (Sesame Place): The whole family will enjoy a ride on this oversized, red double-decker bus with Big Bird and some of his furry friends. The bus goes around and around with a Sesame Street-inspired cityscape as the backdrop. 9 Ride Conservation Partnerships We are pleased to announce partnerships with the following conservation organizations in conjunction with our new 2020 ride line-up: the Alaska SeaLife Center on our new Ice Breaker ride which will highlight animal rescue and climate change in the Arctic region; Penguins International on our new Emperor ride which will focus on penguin awareness and conservation; the Harte Research Center at Texas A&M on our new Texas Stingray ride which will focus on habitat protection in the Gulf of Mexico; and the Wilderness Foundation Africa on our new Iron Gwazi ride which will highlight the plight of endangered African wildlife. Maintenance and Inspection Safety is of utmost importance to us. Maintenance at our theme parks is a key component of safety and guest service and includes two areas of focus: (i) facilities and infrastructure and (ii) rides and attractions. Facilities and infrastructure maintenance consists of all functions associated with upkeep, repair, preventative maintenance, code compliance and improvement of theme park infrastructure. This area is staffed with a combination of external contractors/suppliers and our employees. Rides and attractions maintenance represents all functions dedicated to the inspection, upkeep, repair and testing of guest experiences, particularly rides. Rides and attractions maintenance is also staffed with a combination of external suppliers, inspectors and our employees, who work to assure that ride experiences are operating within the manufacturer’s criteria and that maintenance is conducted according to internal standards, industry best practice and standards (such as ASTM International, formerly known as the American Society for Testing and Materials), state or jurisdictional requirements, as well as the ride designer or manufacturer’s specifications. All ride maintenance personnel are trained to perform their duties according to internal training processes, in addition to recognized industry certification programs for maintenance leadership. Every ride at our theme parks is inspected regularly, according to daily, weekly, monthly and annual schedules, by both park maintenance experts and external consultants. Additionally, all rides are inspected daily by maintenance personnel before use by guests to ensure proper and safe operation. A networked enterprise software system is used to plan and track various maintenance activities, in order to schedule and request work, track completion progress and manage costs of parts and materials. Our Culture and Social Responsibility As a purpose-driven company, our culture is built on our mission to provide experiences that matter for our guests and, in many of our parks, inspiring our guests to protect animals and the wild wonders of our world. Our management team and our employees, often referred to as ambassadors, are committed to social responsibility and strive to connect people to nature and animals and to do so in a socially responsible manner. We create an environment in our theme parks, where each guest can explore a diverse range of experiences meant to inspire and motivate them to join us in protecting animals and our planet. Our purpose and focus on creating experiences that matter for our guests are integral to our organization and the cornerstone of our success. Animal Care and Rescue We provide care for one of the largest zoological collections in the world. Our commitment to these animals includes applying world-class standards of care while striving to provide habitats that promote the health of the animals. Our animal care team is among the most experienced and qualified in the world, making SeaWorld a global leader in animal welfare, husbandry, enrichment and veterinary care. The zoological programs of all three SeaWorld parks, Discovery Cove and Busch Gardens Tampa Bay are validated by several professional zoological assessing organizations. Our parks are accredited members of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (“AZA”), one of the foremost professional zoological organizations in the world. In addition, our three SeaWorld parks and Discovery Cove are accredited by the Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums (“AMMPA”), an association specifically focused on the care of marine mammals. SeaWorld’s facilities have also received accreditation from the International Marine Animal Trainers’ Association (“IMATA”), whose Animal Trainer Development Program was developed to recognize those facilities that have exceptional systems for training animal care givers in the science and art of animal training, while utilizing positive reinforcement. And lastly, our parks are Certified Humane by Humane Conservation, an animal welfare certification standard developed by the independent third party organization American Humane. We take a comprehensive approach to ensuring the health and welfare of the animals in our care that focuses on physical, behavioral and population health. Our animal care team includes board-certified veterinarians, technicians and animal care experts, and we have onsite animal hospitals at each SeaWorld park and a guest-facing, state-of-the-art Animal Care Center at our Busch Gardens park in Tampa, Florida. We have also been at the forefront of advancing understanding and best practice-related behavioral health in animals. 10 We are committed to caring for each individual animal, and to being responsible stewards of our animal populations, including ensuring that we maintain the genetic diversity needed for healthy and self-sustaining populations. We have invested significantly in developing leading-edge reproductive health expertise, technologies and capabilities. Our focus on population health is also driven by our goal of helping to support, and our participation in, Species Survival Plans, which are ultimately aimed at preserving species in the wild. We apply high quality and comprehensive animal care standards, and actively work to advance knowledge and improve standards. We do this by contributing to research and sharing our insights with other zoological organizations around the world. For example, our continued work to define the clinically normal, healthy ranges for key measures in marine animals in our parks has helped to establish and refine the standards used by many veterinarians to assess both wild and managed marine species. This ongoing research also includes defining the basic biology and physiology of animals in our collection. The combined results of these continued research efforts have provided and will continue to provide essential information and tools to help formulate plans to protect species in their natural habitats. We are also a leader in animal rescue. Over the last five decades, through December 31, 2019, we have helped more than 36,000 ill, injured, orphaned or abandoned wild animals in need of our expert care. Working in partnership with state, local and federal agencies, our rescue teams are on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. Our commitment to animals also extends beyond our theme parks and throughout the world. We actively participate in species conservation and rescue efforts as discussed in the “— Conservation & Community Relations ” section which follows. Conservation and Community Relations Our purpose is to inspire people to protect animals and the wild wonders of the world, and a critical way we deliver on this is by providing our guests opportunities to explore and interact with the animals in our parks. Through our up-close animal encounters, educational exhibits, “Inside Look” events, educational presentations and innovative entertainment, we strive to inspire each guest to take action to care for and conserve the natural world. Some of the animals in our care serve as ambassadors for their species through numerous national media and public appearances that educate the public and raise awareness for issues facing wildlife and wild places. We also partner with and support leading research, education and conservation organizations that help protect species of animals at risk in the wild, as well as the habitats that are home to many vulnerable species. We support conservation organizations such as the Killer Whale Research and Conservation Program, in partnership with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, to study and protect endangered killer whales in the wild, with a particular focus on the Southern Resident killer whale population found off the coast of Washington. Another example is a partnership with marine wildlife artist and conservationist Guy Harvey focused on ocean health and the plight of sharks in the wild. We also continue to support the Hubbs-SeaWorld Research Institute, which was started over 55 years ago by one of SeaWorld’s founders and remains a world-renowned scientific research organization committed to conserving and renewing marine life to ensure a healthier planet. Alongside our conservation work, we are committed to giving back to the communities in which our theme parks are located. We focus our philanthropic efforts in three areas: animal preservation and stewardship; youth development and education; and community initiatives that address environmental sustainability. We partner with charities across the country whose values and missions are aligned with our own by providing financial support, in-kind resources, strategic guidance and/or hands-on volunteer work. Additionally, our ambassadors are actively involved in volunteer activities, such as beach and river cleanup efforts, fun run charity fundraisers, local food bank distributions and more. We also provide complimentary tickets and discounts to educators as well as active and former military and their families. Sustainable Operations Environmental conservation is implicit in our purpose. To thrive, animals need vibrant ecosystems and healthy habitats. We understand the adverse effects of human behavior and climate change on ecosystems and the animals who call them home; therefore, we are constantly working to minimize the footprint of our operations. As a part of our commitment to conservation, we have invested in numerous projects to reduce our energy and water use and the amount of waste we generate. For example, in 2019, the first full year of the elevated solar panel project at Aquatica San Diego, the panels generated nearly 100% of the park’s annual energy use. We believe our parks have some of the most advanced and efficient water purification systems in the world, which provide the optimum environment for our marine life. We leverage this knowledge to reclaim and recycle wastewater for reuse, thereby decreasing our consumption of fresh water. We have also implemented a range of other water conservation efforts across our parks, including a natural biofiltration system in 2019 at SeaWorld San Antonio, which is the first of its kind in a zoological setting. Many of our water conservation efforts incorporate lessons from our facilities in San Diego and San Antonio, which, driven in part by drought conditions, have found innovative opportunities to harvest rainwater, reuse water for cooling buildings and adapt landscaping to require less water. We continually look for new ways to reduce water use in our parks and to support water conservation projects elsewhere. 11 We see the impacts of marine debris and litter along shorelines and in coastal waters, estuaries and oceans – a visible reminder of the need to reduce waste. We have implemented programs to generate less waste in our parks and to increase our recycling efforts. For example, in 2019, we replaced polystyrene foam dinnerware products with products made from 100% recycled materials at all of our parks. Also, in 2018, we removed all single use plastic drinking straws and shopping bags. We also have extensive recycling infrastructure in place in all our parks and actively encourage our guests to participate. Several of our parks have been externally recognized for their recycling programs. In 2018, for example, SeaWorld San Diego was selected by the City of San Diego’s Environmental Services Department as a “Recycler of the Year” – the 20 th time the park has received this award. We raise awareness with our employees and guests about the need for all of us to do our part to address this global challenge. Responsible Sourcing Corporate responsibility extends to how we source the goods and services needed to operate our parks and to serve our guests. We have established a Responsible Food Sourcing Policy, which outlines our commitment to partner with food suppliers that deliver products that meet or exceed sustainable, healthy and humane food standards. We have also made a variety of commitments related to the sourcing of particular products. For example, in 2017, we achieved our goal of converting to 100% cage-free eggs. We have also set a goal of purchasing from suppliers that have announced a commitment and published targets to convert to group-housed humane farming. In response to growing guest demand, we have also taken steps to expand the number of plant-based food offerings on our menus across our parks. As part of these efforts, in 2019, we added a sustainable, plant-based burger to our menus at all of our parks. Our Products and Services Admission Tickets We generate most of our revenue from selling admission to our theme parks. For the year ended December 31, 2019, theme park admissions accounted for approximately 57% of our total revenue. We engage with travel agents, ticket resellers and travel agencies, and directly with our guests through our websites and social media, to promote advanced ticket sales and provide guest convenience and ease of entry. Guests who visit our theme parks have the option of purchasing multiple types of admission tickets, from single and multi-day tickets to season or annual passes. In addition, visitors can purchase vacation packages with preferred hotels, behind-the-scenes tours and educational animal encounters, specialty dining packages and front of the line “Quick Queue” access to enhance their experience. We actively use pricing and promotions to manage capacity and maximize revenue. We utilize demand-based pricing for select peak time periods at some of our parks, advance purchase discounts to encourage early commitment, and seasonal pricing models to drive demand in non-peak time periods. Culinary Offerings We strive to deliver a variety of high quality, creative and memorable culinary experiences for our guests. Our culinary team focuses on providing creative menu offerings and ways to deliver those offerings that appeal to our diverse guest base. We offer a variety of dining programs that provide quality food and great value to our guests and drive incremental revenues. While our menu offerings have broad appeal, they also cater to guests who desire healthy options and those with special allergy-related needs. Our all-day-dining program delivers convenience and value to our guests with numerous restaurant choices for one price. Designed specifically for our pass members, our parks now also offer an all-season-dining program, which allows our guests to enjoy up to two meals every day all season long. We also offer creative immersive dining experiences that allow guests to dine up-close with our animals and characters. Our commitment to care for the natural world extends to the food that we serve. Some of our menus feature sustainable, organic, seasonal and locally grown ingredients that aim to minimize environmental impacts to animals and their habitats. In addition, through culinary supply chain management initiatives, we are well-positioned to take advantage of changing economic and market conditions. Merchandise We offer guests the opportunity to capture memories through our products and services, including through traditional retail shops, game venues and customized photos. We make a focused effort to leverage the emotional connection of the theme park experiences, capitalize on trends and optimize brand alignment with our merchandise product offerings. In-park games are designed with the goal of creating positive family experiences for guests of every age. Our merchandise teams also focus on making a visit to our theme parks easy, convenient and comfortable. This includes offering lockers or service vehicle rentals such as strollers, electric personal carts and wheelchairs. 12 Consumer Products and Licensing To capitalize on our popular brands, we leverage content through licensing and consumer product arrangements. We developed licensed consumer products to drive consumer sales through retail channels beyond our theme parks and continue to look for this channel to grow. While currently these licensed consumer products do not represent a significant percentage of our total revenue, we believe by leveraging our brands and our intellectual property through consumer products, we will create new revenue streams and enhance the value of our brands through greater brand visibility, consumer awareness and increased consumer loyalty. In addition, we have expanded our brand appeal through strategic alliances with well-known external brands, including Sesame Street. Beginning in 2016, we incorporated Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer™ and other well-known characters into five of our park holiday programs under a license agreement with Character Arts, LLC, which currently runs through January 2024. Group Events We host a variety of different group events and meetings at our theme parks, both during the day and at night. Our parks provide a wide variety of unique venues, backdrops and products for groups and include venues such as the icy walls of Antarctica, concert ready stadiums, outdoor pavilions, animal habitats and fully air-conditioned ballrooms. Our special group ticket packages and offerings appeal to specialty markets such as youth, sports, social (e.g. family reunions) and fraternal groups (e.g. scouts), as well as corporate groups seeking to recognize and reward their employees. Park buy-outs allow groups to enjoy exclusive itineraries, including meetings, educational presentations and shows, up-close encounters with animals and behind-the-scenes tours. Our group facilities are available year-round and fully customizable as they can be built around any of the park’s special events, educational presentations, inspirational shows, or one-of-a-kind attractions. Each of our theme parks offers attractive venues, such as SeaWorld Orlando’s Ports of Call, a 70,000 square foot dedicated special events complex and banquet facility that includes a ballroom, a collection of four outdoor pavilions and a courtyard in Orlando, or a fully enclosed and air-conditioned pavilion in Tampa. Corporate Sponsorships and Strategic Alliances We seek to secure long-term corporate sponsorships and strategic alliances with leading companies and brands that share our core values, deliver significant brand value and influence and drive mutual business gains. We identify prospective corporate sponsors based on their industry and industry-leading position, and we select them based on their ability to deliver impactful value to our theme parks and our brands, as well as to consumer products and various entertainment platforms. Our corporate sponsors contribute to us in a multitude of ways, such as through direct marketing, advertising, media exposure and licensing opportunities, as well as through contributions to the non-profit SeaWorld & Busch Gardens Conservation Fund. Also see additional discussion concerning our conservation partnerships, such as Guy Harvey, in the “ —Conservation and Community Relations” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Seasonality The theme park industry is seasonal in nature. Historically, we generate the highest revenues in the second and third quarters of each year, in part because seven of our theme parks are only open for a portion of the year. Approximately two-thirds of our attendance and revenues are generated in the second and third quarters of the year and we typically incur a net loss in the first and fourth quarters. The percent mix of revenues by quarter is relatively constant each year, but revenues can shift between the first and second quarters due to the timing of Easter and spring break holidays and between the first and fourth quarters due to the timing of holiday breaks around Christmas and New Year. Even for our five theme parks open year-round, attendance patterns have significant seasonality, driven by holidays, school vacations and weather conditions. Our Guests and Customers Our theme parks are entertainment venues with broad demographic appeal and are located near a number of large metropolitan areas, including 6 of the 10 most populous metropolitan areas in the United States and 8 of the top 25 Best Destinations in the United States (U.S. Census, 2019; TripAdvisor, 2019) . Additionally, because our theme parks are divided between regional and destination theme parks, our guests include local visitors, non-local domestic visitors and international visitors. Intellectual Property Our business is affected by our ability to protect against infringement of our intellectual property, including our trademarks, service marks, domain names, copyrights and other proprietary rights. Important intellectual property includes rights in names, logos, character likenesses, theme park attractions and systems related to the study and care of certain of our animals. In addition, we are party to key license agreements as licensee, including our agreements with Anheuser-Busch, Incorporated (“ABI”) and Sesame Workshop (“Sesame”) as discussed below. 13 Busch Gardens License Agreement Our subsidiary, SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment LLC, is a party to a trademark license agreement with ABI, which governs our use of the Busch Gardens name and logo. Under the license agreement, ABI granted to us a perpetual, exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use the Busch Gardens trademark and certain related domain names in connection with the operation, marketing, promotion and advertising of our theme parks, as well as in connection with the production, use, distribution and sale of merchandise sold in connection with such theme parks. The license extends to our Busch Gardens theme parks located in Williamsburg, Virginia and Tampa, Florida, and may also include any amusement or theme park anywhere in the world that we acquire, build or rebrand with the Busch Gardens name in the future, subject to certain conditions. ABI may not assign, transfer or sell the Busch Gardens mark without first granting us a reasonable right of first refusal to purchase such mark. We have agreed to indemnify ABI from and against third party claims and losses arising out of or in connection with the operation of the theme parks and the related marketing or promotion thereof, any merchandise branded with the licensed marks and the infringement of a third party’s intellectual property. We are required to carry certain insurance coverage throughout the term of the license. The license agreement can be terminated by ABI under certain limited circumstances, including in connection with certain types of change of control of SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment LLC. Sesame License Agreement Our wholly-owned subsidiary, SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc. (“SEA”), is a party to a license agreement with Sesame, a New York not-for-profit corporation. The License Agreement extends SEA’s status as Sesame’s exclusive theme park partner in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands (the “Sesame Territory”), with a second Sesame Place ® theme park scheduled to open no later than mid-2021. On October 21, 2019, we announced that we will open our second Sesame Place theme park at the site of the current Aquatica San Diego in the spring of 2021. After the opening of Sesame Place San Diego, we will have the option to build additional Sesame Place theme parks in the Sesame Territory. Under the terms of the license agreement, including the requirement for certain subsequent approvals from Sesame, Sesame granted SEA the right to use the Sesame Street Elements (as defined below) (a) in connection with the design, building, installation, theming, promotion, and operation of SEA’s existing Sesame Place theme park, located in Langhorne, Pennsylvania (the “Langhorne Sesame Place”) and additional Sesame Place theme parks in the United States, including the recently announced Sesame Street San Diego (collectively, the “Standalone Parks”); (b) in connection with the design, building, installation, theming, promotion, and operation of SEA’s existing Sesame Lands (currently known as Sesame Street ® Land at SeaWorld Orlando, which opened in spring of 2019, Sesame Street Bay of Play at SeaWorld San Antonio, Sesame Street Bay of Play at SeaWorld San Diego, Sesame Street Safari of Fun at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay, and Sesame Street Forest of Fun at Busch Gardens Williamsburg) and additional Sesame Lands, (collectively, the “Sesame Lands”); (c) in connection with the Licensed Products (as defined below); (d) in marketing and promotional activities related to the Standalone Parks and Sesame Lands, including without limitation, marketing, advertising and promotion, character appearances and live presentations (both in park and in off-site promotional activities such as schools, parades, conventions, etc.), and the Licensed Products; and/or (e) to seek and to enter into sponsorship agreements for specific sponsorships of Sesame Street -themed attractions. In addition, SEA has been granted a license to (i) develop and manufacture or have developed and manufactured products that utilize the Sesame Street Elements or to purchase products that utilize the Sesame Street Elements from Sesame’s third party licensees (collectively, the “Licensed Products”), (ii) to market, promote, advertise, distribute and sell the Licensed Products within each of SEA’s theme parks and through online stores on SEA’s websites and targeted primarily to consumers in the United States and (iii) to contract with third party vendors to promote, distribute and sell the Licensed Products within the United States. The term “Sesame Street Elements” means all current and hereafter developed or owned titles, marks, names, characters (including any new Sesame Street characters shown on Sesame Street and owned in whole or controlled by Sesame), images, likenesses, audio, video, audiovisual, logos, themes, symbols, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, visual representations and designs, and other intellectual property (whether in two- or three-dimensional form and including animated and mechanical representations) owned or controlled by Sesame (or its affiliates), and associated with the “ Sesame Street ” television property, whether previously (unless retired) or currently on “ Sesame Street ” or whether hereafter developed or owned and the names and marks “ Sesame Place ” and “ Sesame Land, ” but expressly excluding “Kermit the Frog.” Sesame has reserved rights to build family entertainment centers using the Sesame Street Elements subject to certain territorial restrictions surrounding SEA’s Sesame Place Standalone Parks and Sesame Lands within the Sesame Territory. The license agreement has an initial term through December 31, 2031, with an automatic additional 15 year extension plus a 5 year option added from each new Standalone Park opening. Pursuant to the license agreement, SEA pays a specified annual license fee, as well as a specified royalty based on revenues earned in connection with sales of Licensed Products, all food and beverage items utilizing the licensed elements and any events utilizing such elements if a separate fee is paid for such event. 14 International Development Strategy We believe that in addition to the growth potential that exists domestically, our brands can also have significant appeal in certain international markets. We continue to make progress in our partnership with Miral Asset Management LLC to develop SeaWorld Abu Dhabi, a first-of-its-kind marine life themed park on Yas Island (the “Middle East Project”). As part of this partnership, we are providing certain services pertaining to the planning and design of the Middle East Project, with funding received from our partner in the Middle East expected to offset our internal expenses. The Middle East Project is at an advanced stage of design and SeaWorld Abu Dhabi is on track to finish construction in 2022. The Middle East Project is subject to various conditions, including, but not limited to, the parties completing the design development and there is no assurance that the Middle East Project will be completed or advance to the next stage . In March 2017, we entered into a Park Exclusivity and Concept Design Agreement (the “ECDA”) and a Center Concept & Preliminary Design Support Agreement (the “CDSA”) with an affiliate of Zhonghong Zhuoye Group Co., Ltd., (“ZHG Group”) to provide design, support and advisory services for various potential projects and granting exclusive rights in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau (the “Territory”). In April 2019, we terminated the ZHG Agreements for non-payment of undisputed amounts owed. See Note 17–Related Party Transactions to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. For a discussion of certain risks associated with our international development strategy, including the Middle East Project, see the “ Risk Factors ” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “ Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry—We may not realize the benefits of developments, restructurings, acquisitions or other strategic initiatives .” Our Industry We believe that the theme park industry is an attractive sector characterized by a proven business model that generates significant cash flow and has avenues for growth. Theme parks offer a strong consumer value proposition, particularly when compared to other forms of out-of-home entertainment such as concerts, sporting events, cruises and movies. As a result, theme parks attract a broad range of guests and generally exhibit strong operating margin across regions, operators, park types and macroeconomic conditions. Competition Our theme parks and other product and entertainment offerings compete directly for discretionary spending with other destination and regional theme parks and water and amusement parks and indirectly with other types of recreational facilities and forms of entertainment, including movies, home entertainment options, sports attractions, restaurants and vacation travel. Principal direct competitors of our theme parks include theme parks operated by The Walt Disney Company, Universal Parks and Resorts, Six Flags Entertainment Corporation, Cedar Fair, L.P., Merlin Entertainments ltd and Hershey Entertainment and Resorts Company. Our highly differentiated products provide a value proposition and a complementary experience to those offered by fantasy-themed Disney and Universal parks. In addition, we benefit from the significant capital investments made in developing the tourism industry in the Orlando area. The Orlando theme park market is extremely competitive, with a high concentration of theme parks operated by several companies. Competition is based on multiple factors including location, price, the originality and perceived quality of the rides and attractions, the atmosphere and cleanliness of the theme park, the quality of food and entertainment, weather conditions, ease of travel to the theme park (including direct flights by major airlines), and availability and cost of transportation to a theme park. We believe we can compete effectively, due to our strong brand recognition, unique and extensive zoological collection, diversity of product offerings and locations, targeted capital investments and valuable real estate. Additionally, we believe that our theme parks feature a sufficient quality and variety of rides and attractions, educational and interactive experiences, merchandise locations, restaurants and family orientation to make them highly competitive with other destination and regional theme parks, as well as other forms of entertainment. Employees As of December 31, 2019, we employed approximately 4,300 full-time employees and approximately 11,000 part-time employees. During our peak operating season in 2019, we employed approximately 3,900 additional seasonal employees, many of whom are high school and college students. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our employee relations to be good. Approximately half of our leaders are women and 44% are minorities, a demonstration of our commitment to create an inclusive workplace. 15 Regulatory Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances including, but not limited to, those regulating the environment, display, possession and care of our animals, amusement park rides, building and construction, health and safety, labor and employment, workplace safety, zoning and land use and alcoholic beverage and food service. Key statutes and treaties relating to the display, possession and care of our zoological collection include the Endangered Species Act, Marine Mammal Protection Act, Animal Welfare Act, Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species and Fauna Protection Act and the Lacey Act. We must also comply with the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, Wild Bird Conservation Act and National Environmental Policy Act, among other laws and regulations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable laws, regulations and ordinances; however, such requirements may change over time, and there can be no assurance that new requirements, changes in enforcement policies or newly discovered conditions relating to our properties or operations will not require significant expenditures in the future. Recent Regulatory Developments The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”) released a proposed rule on February 3, 2016 to amend the Animal Welfare Act regulations concerning the humane handling, care and treatment of marine mammals in captivity (the “Proposed APHIS Regulations”). The Proposed APHIS Regulations were subject to public comment which ended on May 4, 2016. We submitted a comment letter to APHIS expressing our views on the Proposed APHIS Regulations. The full impact of the Proposed APHIS Regulations on our business will not be known until the Proposed APHIS Regulations are finalized. On November 20, 2019, the Federal Register published the latest Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions. The Proposed APHIS Regulations were not listed as priority APHIS matters indicating that the agency did not plan any further action at that time on the matter. However, there can be no assurance that APHIS will not propose or enact regulations that could materially impact the Company in the future. For a discussion of certain risks associated with federal and state regulations governing the treatment of animals, see the “ Risk Factors ” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “ Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry—We are subject to complex federal and state regulations governing the treatment of animals, which can change, and to claims and lawsuits by activist groups before government regulators and in the courts. ” Insurance We maintain insurance of the type and in the amounts that we believe to be commercially reasonable for businesses in our industry. We maintain primary and excess casualty coverage of up to $120.0 million. As part of this coverage, we retain deductible/self-insured retention exposures consistent with our normal expected losses related to general liability claims, automobile liability and workers’ compensation claims. We maintain employers’ liability and all coverage required by law in the states in which we operate. Defense costs are included in the insurance coverage we obtain against losses in these areas. Based upon our historical experience of reported claims and an estimate for incurred-but-not-reported claims, we accrue a liability for our deductible/self-insured retention contingencies regarding general liability, automobile liability and workers’ compensation exposures. We maintain additional forms of special casualty coverage which we believe is appropriate for our business. We also maintain commercial property coverage against fire, natural perils, so-called “extended coverage” perils such as civil commotion, business interruption and terrorism exposures for protection of our real and personal properties (other than land). We generally renegotiate our insurance policies on an annual basis. We cannot predict the amounts of premium cost that we may be required to pay for future insurance coverage, the level of any deductibles/self-insured retentions or co-insurance we may retain applicable thereto, the level of aggregate excess coverage available, the availability of coverage for special or specific risks or whether the amount of insurance will be sufficient to cover all actual perils that may occur. Corporate History Our legacy started in 1959 with the opening of our first Busch Gardens theme park in Tampa, Florida. Since then, we have grown our portfolio of strong brands and strategically expanded across five states. On December 1, 2009, investment funds affiliated with The Blackstone Group L.P. and certain co-investors, through SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc. (“SEA”), acquired 100% of the equity interests of Sea World LLC (f/k/a Sea World, Inc.) and SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment LLC (f/k/a Busch Entertainment Corporation) from certain subsidiaries of Anheuser-Busch Companies, Inc. We refer to this acquisition and related financing transactions as the “2009 Transactions.” SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware on October 2, 2009 in connection with the 2009 Transactions and changed its name from SW Holdco, Inc. to SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. in December 2012. We completed our initial public offering (the “IPO”) in April 2013 and our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “SEAS”. 16 On May 8, 2017, an affiliate of ZHG Group, Sun Wise (UK) Co., LTD (“ZHG”) acquired approximately 21% of the then outstanding shares of our common stock from certain affiliates of Blackstone (the “Seller”), pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement between ZHG and the Seller (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”). ZHG pledged such shares in connection with certain loan obligations of ZHG (the “Pledged Shares”). ZHG subsequently defaulted on such loan obligations and, as a result, certain lenders (the “Lenders”) foreclosed on the Pledged Shares and, accordingly, the Pledged Shares were transferred to a security agent for the Lenders (the “Security Agent”), on May 3, 2019. On May 27, 2019, the Security Agent entered into a share repurchase agreement with us pursuant to which the Security Agent agreed to sell and we agreed to purchase 5,615,874 of the Pledged Shares held by the Security Agent (the “SEAS Repurchase”). On May 27, 2019, the Security Agent also entered into a stock purchase agreement with Hill Path Capital LP (“Hill Path”) and certain of its affiliates pursuant to which the Security Agent agreed to sell and certain affiliates of Hill Path agreed to purchase, in the aggregate, 13,214,000 of the Pledged Shares held by the Security Agent. The purchase closed on May 30, 2019. As of December 31, 2019 , Hill Path owned approximately 34.6% of our total outstanding common stock.

Risk Factors The following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating us and this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain statements in “Risk Factors” are forward-looking statements. See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” elsewhere in this report: Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry We are subject to complex federal and state regulations governing the treatment of animals, which can change, and to claims and lawsuits by activist groups before government regulators and in the courts. We operate in a complex and evolving regulatory environment and are subject to various federal and state statutes and regulations and international treaties implemented by federal law. The states in which we operate also regulate zoological activity involving the import and export of exotic and native wildlife, endangered and/or otherwise protected species, zoological display and anti-cruelty statutes. We incur significant compliance costs in connection with these regulations and violation of such regulations could subject us to fines and penalties and result in the loss of our licenses and permits, which, if occurred, could impact our ability to display certain animals. Future amendments to existing statutes, regulations and treaties or new statutes, regulations and treaties or lawsuits against the Company, government agencies or other third parties in the zoological industry may potentially restrict our ability to maintain our animals, or to acquire new ones to supplement or sustain our breeding programs or otherwise adversely affect our business. In 2016, the California Orca Protection Act was enacted into law and (i) codified the end of captive breeding programs and the export and import of genetic materials for orcas in California, (ii) prohibits the import or export of new orcas into or existing orcas out of California, (iii) permits the transfer of orcas currently in California among existing SeaWorld facilities and (iv) requires educational presentations of orcas in California. We introduced new orca programs in our San Diego park in 2017 which are consistent with these standards. In 2018, a Florida State lawmaker filed a Florida Orca Protection bill, with similar language to the California legislation, which would have similar implications to the California legislation; however, we have introduced new orca programs at all SeaWorld parks which are consistent with the proposed standards. In 2019, a California lawmaker introduced an amendment to the California Orca Protection Act which could expand the act to cover all whales and dolphin species. If enacted as proposed, the California Orca Protection Act could require changes to our business and could result in material costs and negatively impact our results of operations. Separately, the Orca Responsibility and Care Advancement Act (the “ORCA Act”), which was reintroduced as a bill in 2017, would have prohibited, if enacted, the breeding, the taking (wild capture), and the import or export of orcas for the purposes of public display and the transport of orcas from one park to another. In 2015 legislation was proposed that would have directed the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”) to issue updated regulations for the display of marine mammals in domestic zoos and aquaria within six months of enactment. This proposed rule would have affected sections in the regulations for the protection of all marine mammals in the United States relating to human marine mammal interactive programs, space requirements, water quality, indoor facilities, outdoor facilities, implementation dates, and variances. If enacted, the Proposed APHIS Regulations could increase our regulatory compliance burdens and costs, impact the way and manner our marine mammals are displayed and require additional management attention and investments to come into compliance. On November 20, 2019, the Federal Register published the latest Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions. The Proposed APHIS Regulations were not listed as priority APHIS matters indicating that the agency did not plan any further action at that time on the matter. However, there can be no assurance that APHIS will not propose or enact regulations that could materially impact the Company in the future. In light of the uncertain legal, legislative and regulatory environment and evolving public sentiment, we continue to evaluate a broad spectrum of enhancements, modifications and alternatives with respect to the display, husbandry and breeding practices, handling and care, and study and research of our orcas and other marine animals. Any decisions regarding such matters are subject to consideration and assessment of various factors including, but not limited to, the health and welfare of the animals, guest sentiment, market conditions, anticipated impact on our business, regulatory environment, legal proceedings, and input from our conservation partners, and other factors. If we were to pursue or be required to pursue any alternative approaches with respect to the display, husbandry and breeding practices, handling and care, or study and research of our orcas or other animals in our zoological collection, the full impact of such alternatives on our business will not be known until such alternatives are finalized. In the meantime, we continue to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate the impact of and ensure compliance with the applicable regulatory and other developments. 18 We are subject to scrutiny by activist and other third-party groups and/or media who can pressure governmental agencies, vendors, partners, and/or regulators, bring action in the courts or create negative publicity about us. From time to time, animal activist and other third-party groups may make claims before government agencies, bring lawsuits against us, and/or attempt to generate negative publicity associated with our business. Such activities sometimes are based on allegations that we do not properly care for some of our animals. On other occasions, such activities are specifically designed to change existing law or enact new law in order to impede our ability to retain, exhibit, acquire or breed animals. While we seek to structure our operations to comply with all applicable federal and state laws and vigorously defend ourselves when sued, there are no assurances as to the outcome of future claims and lawsuits that could be brought against us, governmental agencies or other third parties in the zoological industry. Even if not successful, these lawsuits can require deployment of our resources and can lead to negative publicity. Negative publicity created by activists or in the media could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. At times, activists and other third-party groups have also attempted to generate negative publicity related to our relationships with our business partners, such as corporate sponsors, promotional partners, vendors, ticket resellers and others. These activities have at times led relationships with some ticket resellers to be terminated. Although sales from any particular ticket reseller may not constitute a significant portion of our ticket sales, if a relationship with a ticket reseller is terminated, we will attempt to find alternative distribution channels. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful or that those channels will be as successful or not have additional costs. If we are unable to find cost effective alternative distribution channels, the loss of multiple ticket resellers could have a negative impact on our results of operations. Various factors beyond our control could adversely affect attendance and guest spending patterns at our theme parks. Various factors beyond our control could adversely affect attendance and guest spending patterns at our theme parks. These factors could also affect our suppliers, vendors, insurance carriers and other contractual counterparties. Such factors include but are not limited to: • bad weather and even forecasts of bad weather, including abnormally hot, cold and/or wet weather, particularly during weekends, holidays or other peak periods; • natural disasters, such as hurricanes, fires, earthquakes, tsunamis, tornados, floods and volcanic eruptions and man-made disasters such as oil spills, which may deter travelers from scheduling vacations or cause them to cancel travel or vacation plans; • fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; • low consumer confidence; • outbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases or consumers’ concerns relating to potential exposure to travel-related health concerns such as pandemics and epidemics such as Ebola, Zika, Influenza H1N1, avian bird flu, SARS, MERS and Coronavirus; • changes in the desirability of particular locations or travel patterns of both our domestic and international guests; • oil prices and travel costs and the financial condition of the airline, automotive and other transportation-related industries, any travel-related disruptions or incidents and their impact on travel or decrease transportation options to cities where we have parks; • war, terrorist activities or threats and heightened travel security measures instituted in response to these events; • actions or statements by U.S. and foreign governmental officials, including the U.S. President and administration officials, related to travel and corporate travel-related activities (including changes to the U.S. visa rules) and the resulting public perception of such travel and activities; and • interruption of public or private utility services to our theme parks. 19 Any one or more of these factors could adversely affect attendance, revenue and per capita spending at our theme parks, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates impact our business. A strong dollar increases the cost for international tourists and could impact their spending. In addition, demand for our parks is highly dependent on the general environment for travel and tourism, which can be significantly adversely affected by extreme weather events. Any of these such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Additionally, because many of the attractions at our parks are outdoors, attendance at our parks is adversely affected by bad or extreme weather conditions and forecasts of bad or mixed weather conditions, which negatively affects our revenues and results of operations. For example, attendance at our parks in 2019 was negatively impacted by Hurricane Dorian over Labor Day weekend. Separately, in 2017 we also experienced negative impacts from weather events, particularly hurricanes, which caused park closures in Tampa and Orlando and park closures and other weather impacts in Texas and Virginia. Incidents or adverse publicity concerning our theme parks, the theme park industry or zoological facilities generally could harm our brands or reputation as well as negatively impact our revenues and profitability. Our brands and our reputation are among our most important assets. Our ability to attract and retain guests depends, in part, upon the external perceptions of the Company, the quality of our theme parks and services and our corporate and management integrity. The operation of theme parks involves the risk of accidents, illnesses, environmental incidents and other incidents which may negatively affect the perception of guest and employee safety, health, security and guest satisfaction and which could negatively impact our brands or reputation and our business and results of operations. An accident or an injury at any of our theme parks or at theme parks operated by competitors, particularly an accident or an injury involving the safety of guests and employees, that receives media attention, is the topic of a book, film, documentary or is otherwise the subject of public discussions, may harm our brands or reputation, cause a loss of consumer confidence in the Company, reduce attendance at our theme parks and negatively impact our results of operations. Such incidents have occurred in the past and may occur in the future. In addition, other types of adverse publicity concerning our business, the theme park industry or zoological facilities generally could harm our brands, reputation and results of operations. The considerable expansion in the use of social media over recent years has compounded the impact of negative publicity. There has been and may continue to be perception issues and negative media attention that create a barrier to attendance at our parks which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We could be adversely affected by a decline in discretionary consumer spending or consumer confidence. Our success depends to a significant extent on discretionary consumer spending, which is heavily influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income. In the past, severe economic downturns, coupled with high volatility and uncertainty as to the future global economic landscape, have had an adverse effect on consumers’ discretionary income and consumer confidence. Volatile, negative or uncertain economic conditions and recessionary periods may adversely impact attendance figures, the frequency with which guests choose to visit our theme parks and guest spending patterns at our theme parks. The actual or perceived weakness in the economy could also lead to decreased spending by our guests. For example, in 2009 and 2010, we experienced a decline in attendance as a result of the global economic crisis, which in turn adversely affected our revenue and profitability. Both attendance and total revenue per capita spending at our theme parks are key drivers of our revenue and profitability, and reductions in either can materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. A significant portion of our revenues are generated in the States of Florida, California and Virginia and in the Orlando market. Any risks affecting such markets, such as natural disasters, severe weather and travel-related disruptions or incidents, may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Approximately 57%, 16% and 14% of our revenues in 2019 were generated in the States of Florida, California and Virginia, respectively. In addition, our revenues and results of operations depend significantly on the results of our Orlando theme parks. The Orlando theme park market is extremely competitive, with a high concentration of theme parks operated by several companies. Any risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, such as the occurrence of natural disasters and travel-related disruptions or incidents, affecting the States of Florida, California and Virginia generally or our Orlando theme parks in particular may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, especially if they have the effect of decreasing attendance at our theme parks or, in extreme cases, cause us to close any of our theme parks for any period of time. For example, in 2019, Florida was negatively impacted by Hurricane Dorian, in 2017, Tampa and Orlando were negatively impacted by Hurricane Irma and, to a lesser extent, Hurricane Harvey which caused park closures and travel disruptions in Texas, as well as weather impacts in Virginia and, in 2016, both Florida and Virginia were impacted by Hurricanes Hermine and Matthew, which caused physical damage and power outages in various parts of Florida and Virginia. Although we attempt to manage our exposure to such events by implementing our hurricane preparedness plan, our theme parks located in Orlando and Tampa, Florida and in Williamsburg, Virginia experienced closures as a result of these storms, which negatively impact attendance and results of operations. 20 Our operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations. We have historically experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in our annual theme park attendance and revenue, which are typically higher in our second and third quarters, partly because seven of our theme parks are only open for a portion of the year. Approximately two-thirds of our attendance and revenues are generated in the second and third quarters of the year and we typically incur a net loss in the first and fourth quarters. In addition, the timing of school vacations and school start dates also cause fluctuations in our quarterly theme park attendance and revenue. For example, revenues can shift between the first and second quarters due to the timing of Easter and spring break holidays and between the first and fourth quarters due to the timing of holiday breaks around Christmas and New Year. Even for our five theme parks open year-round, attendance patterns have significant seasonality, driven by holidays, school vacations and weather conditions. Furthermore, the operating season at some of our theme parks, including SeaWorld San Antonio, Aquatica San Antonio, Adventure Island, Aquatica San Diego, Busch Gardens Williamsburg, Water Country USA and Sesame Place, is of limited duration. In addition, most of our expenses for maintenance and costs of adding new attractions at our seasonal theme parks are incurred when the operating season is over, which may increase the need for borrowing to fund such expenses during such periods. When conditions or events described in this section occur during the operating season, particularly during the second and third quarters, there is only a limited period of time during which the impact of those conditions or events can be mitigated. Accordingly, such conditions or events may have a disproportionately adverse effect on our revenues and cash flow. Because we operate in a highly competitive industry, our revenues, profits or market share could be harmed if we are unable to compete effectively. The entertainment industry, and the theme park industry in particular, is highly competitive. Our theme parks compete with other theme, water and amusement parks and with other types of recreational facilities and forms of entertainment, including movies, home entertainment options, family entertainment centers, sports attractions, restaurants and vacation travel. Principal direct competitors of our theme parks include theme parks operated by The Walt Disney Company, Universal Parks and Resorts, Six Flags Entertainment Corporation, Cedar Fair, L.P., Merlin Entertainments ltd, Herschend Family Entertainment and Hershey Entertainment and Resorts Company. The principal competitive factors of a theme park include location, price, originality and perceived quality of the rides and attractions, the atmosphere and cleanliness of the theme park, the quality of its food and entertainment, weather conditions, ease of travel to the theme park (including direct flights by major airlines), and availability and cost of transportation to a theme park. Certain of our direct competitors have substantially greater financial resources than we do, and they may be able to adapt more quickly to changes in guest preferences or devote greater resources to their attractions or promotion of their offerings and attractions than us. Our competitors may be able to attract guests to their theme parks in lieu of our own through the development or acquisition of new rides, attractions or shows that are perceived by guests to be of a higher quality and entertainment value. As a result, we may not be able to compete successfully against such competitors. If we are unable to compete with new and existing attractions, our results of operations could be negatively impacted. Featuring animals at our theme parks involves risks. Our theme parks feature numerous displays and interactions that include animals. All animal enterprises involve some degree of risk. All animal interactions by our employees and our guests in attractions in our theme parks, where offered, involves risk. While we maintain strict safety procedures for the protection of our employees and guests, injuries or death, while rare, have occurred in the past. For example, in February 2010, a trainer was killed while engaged in an interaction with an orca. Following this incident, we were subject to an inspection by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), which resulted in citations concerning alleged violations of the Occupational Safety and Health Act and certain regulations thereunder. In connection with this incident, we reviewed and revised our safety protocols and made certain safety-related facility enhancements such as revising training protocols used in show performances. This incident has also been and continues to be the subject of significant media attention, including extensive television and newspaper coverage, a documentary and a book, as well as discussions in social media. This incident and similar events that may occur in the future may harm our reputation, reduce attendance and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We maintain insurance of the type and in amounts that we believe are commercially reasonable and that are available to animal enterprise related businesses in the theme park industry. We cannot predict the level of the premiums that we may be required to pay for subsequent insurance coverage, the level of any self-insurance retention or co-insurance applicable thereto, the level of aggregate coverage available, the availability of coverage for specific risks, or whether insurance we do maintain will be sufficient. 21 Animals in our care are important to our theme parks, and they could be exposed to infectious diseases. Many of our theme parks are distinguished from those of our competitors in that we offer guest interactions with animals. Individual animals, specific species of animals or groups of animals in our zoological collection could be exposed to infectious diseases. While we have never had any such experiences, an outbreak of an infectious disease among any animals in our theme parks or the public’s perception that a certain disease could be harmful to human health may materially adversely affect our zoological collection, our business, financial condition and results of operations. The high fixed cost structure of theme park operations can result in significantly lower margins if revenues decline. A large portion of our expenses is relatively fixed because the costs for employees, maintenance, animal care, utilities, advertising and insurance do not vary significantly with attendance. These fixed costs may increase at a greater rate than our revenues and may not be able to be reduced at the same rate as declining revenues. If cost-cutting efforts are insufficient to offset declines in revenues or are impracticable, we could experience a material decline in margins, revenues, profitability and reduced or negative cash flows. Such effects can be especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth. Changes in consumer tastes and preferences for entertainment and consumer products could reduce demand for our entertainment offerings and products and adversely affect the profitability of our business. The success of our business depends on our ability to consistently provide, maintain and expand theme park attractions as well as create online material and consumer products that meet changing consumer preferences . In addition, consumers from outside the United States constitute an important portion of our theme park attendance, and our success depends in part on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to tastes and preferences of this consumer group. If our entertainment offerings and products do not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or if consumer preferences change, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Cyber security risks and the failure to maintain the integrity of internal or guest data could result in damages to our reputation, the disruption of operations and/or subject us to costs, fines or lawsuits. We collect internal and customer data for business purposes. This data may include personal identifiable information held in our various information technology systems which collect, process, summarize and report such data. We also maintain personally identifiable information about our employees. The integrity and protection of our customer, employee and company data is critical to our business. Our guests and employees have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information. The regulatory environment, as well as the requirements imposed on us by the credit card industry, governing information, security and privacy laws is increasingly demanding and continues to evolve. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act took effect in January 2020 and imposes new requirements for identifying, managing, securing, tracking, producing and deleting consumer privacy information in California. Maintaining compliance with applicable security and privacy regulations may increase our operating costs and/or adversely impact our ability to market our theme parks, products and services to our guests. We also rely on accounting, financial and operational management information technology systems to conduct our operations. If these information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. We face security threats, including but not limited to cyber security attacks on our data infrastructure. We expect to continue devoting significant resources to the security of our information technology systems and the training of our employees and we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate technological threats. There can be no assurance that these procedures, investments and/or controls will be sufficient to prevent penetrations, malicious acts or disruptions to our systems. Furthermore, a penetrated or compromised data system or the intentional, inadvertent or negligent release or disclosure of data could result in theft, loss, fraudulent or unlawful use of guest, employee, company or protected data which could harm our reputation or result in remedial and other costs, fines or lawsuits and require significant management attention and resources to be spent. In addition, our insurance coverage and indemnification arrangements that we enter into, if any, may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to cyber security attacks or disruptions resulting from such events. To date, cyber security attacks directed at us have not had a material impact on our financial results. Due to the evolving nature of security threats, however, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted. 22 Technology interruptions or failures that impair access to our websites or information technology systems could adversely affect our business or operations. The satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our web sites and our infrastructure are critical to the conduct of our business. Any system interruptions that result in the unavailability or slowness of our websites could impact our ability to market or sell admissions or other products which could adversely affect our results of operations and/or result in negative publicity. We have in the past experienced, or may in the future experience, temporary system interruptions for a variety of reasons, including security incidents, viruses, telecommunication and other network failures, power failures, programming errors, undetected bugs, design faults, data corruption, denial-of-service attacks, legacy systems, poor scalability or network overload from an overwhelming number of traffic trying to reach our websites at the same time. Even a disruption as brief as a few minutes could have a negative impact on our online activities and could result in a loss of revenue. For example, recently there were instances when our websites experienced slow performance and unavailability for some guests. Although these issues were short-lived and did not have a material impact to our results of operations, prolonged or repeat system interruptions and network failures could adversely impact our operations as a significant portion of our admissions revenues are from ticket purchases made online. Additionally, damage, failures or interruptions to our information technology systems may require a significant investment to update, remediate or replace with alternate systems, and we may suffer interruptions in our operations as a result. In addition, costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations and/or result in negative publicity. Any material interruptions or failures in our systems, including those that may result from our failure to adequately develop, implement and maintain a robust disaster recovery plan and backup systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance. Increased labor costs and employee health and welfare benefits may negatively impact our operations. Labor is a primary component in the cost of operating our business. We devote significant resources to recruiting and training our employees. Increased labor costs due to competition, increased minimum wage or employee benefit costs or otherwise, would adversely impact our operating expenses. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 and the amendments thereto contain provisions that have impacted our healthcare costs. Any future amendments could significantly increase our compensation costs, which would reduce our net income and adversely affect our cash flows. In 2016, San Diego passed legislation which, after the first increase on January 1, 2017, increases its minimum wage over a six year period to $15 an hour by January 1, 2023. After the San Diego minimum wage reaches $15 an hour, it will change based on the consumer price index. Additionally, Virginia has recently proposed legislation that, if passed, would take effect July 1, 2020 and increase its minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2024. In November 2020, Florida will vote on a ballot initiative that, if passed, would raise its minimum wage to $15 by September 2026. In addition, a number of companies from whom we compete for talent have publicly announced wage increases. Increases to the minimum wage in locations where we do business, wages of companies from whom we compete for talent and/or increased benefit costs will negatively impact our operating expenses. Our growth strategy may not achieve the anticipated results. Our future success will depend on our ability to grow our business, including through capital investments to improve existing and develop new theme parks, rides, attractions and shows, as well as in-park product offerings and product offerings outside of our theme parks. Our growth and innovation strategies require significant commitments of management resources and capital investments and may not grow our revenues at the rate we expect or at all. As a result, we may not be able to recover the costs incurred in developing our new projects and initiatives or to realize their intended or projected benefits, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We may not be able to fund theme park capital expenditures and investment in future attractions and projects. A principal competitive factor for a theme park is the originality and perceived quality of its rides and attractions. We need to make continued capital investments through maintenance and the regular addition of new rides and attractions. Our ability to fund capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and to raise capital from third parties. We cannot assure you that our operations will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to fund such costs, or that we will be able to obtain sufficient financing on adequate terms, or at all, which could cause us to delay or abandon certain projects or plans. 23 Adverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved in the normal course of our business could reduce our profits or limit our ability to operate our business. We are subject to allegations, claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business, which may include claims by third parties, including guests who visit our theme parks, our employees, stockholders and/or regulators. We are currently subject to securities litigation. We are also subject to audits, inspections and investigations by, or receives requests for information from, various federal and state regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”), the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“Cal-OSHA”), state departments of labor, the Florida Fish & Wildlife Commission (“FWC”), the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”), the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS” ), the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). From time to time, various parties may also bring lawsuits against us. For example, on February 11, 2020, we announced that we had entered into a settlement agreement with respect to a previously disclosed class action lawsuit commenced in 2014, captioned Baker v. SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc ., et al., Case No. 14-CV-02129-MMA (AGS) (“Baker”). The proposed settlement, which is subject to certain conditions, including court approval, requires us to pay $65.0 million for claims alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as the costs of administration and legal fees and expenses. The proposed settlement does not include or constitute an admission, concession, or finding of any fault, liability, or wrongdoing by us or any defendant. There can be no assurance that the proposed settlement agreement will be approved by the court. Also, in June 2017, we received a subpoena in connection with an investigation by the DOJ concerning certain disclosures and public statements made by us and certain individuals on or before August 2014, and trading in our securities. We also had received subpoenas from the staff of the SEC in connection with these matters. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we reached a settlement with the SEC. In connection with the settlement, without admitting or denying the substantive allegations in the SEC’s complaint, we agreed to the entry of a final judgment ordering us to pay a civil penalty of $4.0 million and enjoining us from violation of certain provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and certain rules thereunder. The settlement was approved by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on September 24, 2018. On December 11, 2018, the DOJ informed us that it does not intend to take any action against us or any individuals in connection with its investigation. We consider the DOJ matter concluded. We discuss securities litigation and other litigation to which we are subject in greater detail in “ Item 3. Legal Proceedings ” and Note 15–Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The outcome of many of these proceedings cannot be predicted. If any proceedings, audits, inspections or investigations were to be determined adversely against us or resulted in legal actions, claims, regulatory proceedings, enforcement actions, or judgments, fines, or settlements involving a payment of material sums of money, or if injunctive relief were issued against us, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Even the successful defense of legal proceedings may cause us to incur substantial legal costs and may divert management’s attention and resources. Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could adversely affect our business. Our intellectual property, including our trademarks, service marks, domain names, copyrights, patent and other proprietary rights, constitutes a significant part of our value. To protect our intellectual property rights, we rely upon a combination of trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret and unfair competition laws of the United States and other countries, as well as contract provisions and third-party policies and procedures governing internet/domain name registrations. However, there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful in any given case, particularly in those countries where the laws do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. We may be unable to prevent the misappropriation, infringement or violation of our intellectual property rights, breaching any contractual obligations to us, or independently developing intellectual property that is similar to ours, any of which could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed, adversely affect our revenues or otherwise harm our business. We have obtained and applied for numerous U.S. and foreign trademark and service mark registrations and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks and service marks or other intellectual property, as appropriate. We cannot guarantee that any of our pending applications will be approved by the applicable governmental authorities. Moreover, even if the applications are approved, third parties may seek to oppose or otherwise challenge these registrations. A failure to obtain registrations for our intellectual property in the United States and other countries could limit our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and impede our marketing efforts in those jurisdictions. We are actively engaged in enforcement and other activities to protect our intellectual property rights. If it became necessary for us to resort to litigation to protect these rights, any proceedings could be burdensome, costly and divert the attention of our personnel, and we may not prevail. In addition, any repeal or weakening of laws or enforcement in the United States or internationally intended to protect intellectual property rights could make it more difficult for us to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, negatively impacting their value and increasing the cost of enforcing our rights. 24 We may be subject to claims for infringing the intellectual property rights of others, which could be costly and result in the loss of significant intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that we do not and will not infringe the intellectual property rights of others. We have been in the past, and may be in the future, subject to litigation and other claims in the ordinary course of our business based on allegations of infringement or other violations of the intellectual property rights of others. Regardless of their merits, intellectual property claims can divert the efforts of our personnel and are often time-consuming and expensive to litigate or settle. In addition, to the extent claims against us are successful, we may have to pay substantial money damages or discontinue, modify or rename certain products or services that are found to be in violation of another party’s rights. We may have to seek a license (if available on acceptable terms, or at all) to continue offering products and services, which may significantly increase our operating expenses. If we lose licenses and permits required to exhibit animals and/or violate laws and regulations, our business will be adversely affected. We are required to hold government licenses and permits, some of which are subject to yearly or periodic renewal, for purposes of possessing, exhibiting and maintaining animals. Although our theme parks’ licenses and permits have always been renewed in the past, in the event that any of our licenses or permits are not renewed or any of our licenses or permits are revoked, portions of the affected theme park might not be able to remain open for purpose of displaying or retaining the animals covered by such license or permit. Such an outcome could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we are subject to periodic inspections by federal and state agencies and the subsequent issuance of inspection reports. While we believe that we comply with, or exceed, requisite care and maintenance standards that apply to our animals, government inspectors can cite us for alleged statutory or regulatory violations. In unusual instances when we are cited for an alleged deficiency, we are most often given the opportunity to correct any purported deficiencies without penalty. It is possible, however, that in some cases a federal or state regulator could seek to impose monetary fines on us. In the past, when we have been subjected to governmental claims for fines, the amounts involved were not material to our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, while highly unlikely, we cannot predict whether any future fines that regulators might seek to impose would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Moreover, many of the statutes under which we operate allow for the imposition of criminal sanctions. While neither of the foregoing situations are likely to occur, either could negatively affect the business, financial condition or results of operations at our theme parks. If we lose key personnel, our business may be adversely affected. Our success depends in part upon a number of key employees, including members of our senior management team who have extensive experience in the industry. We may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employees, particularly if we do not offer employment terms that are competitive with the rest of the market. Failure to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified employees, or failure to develop and implement a viable succession plan, could adversely affect our business and our future success. Changes in our management team and to the Board of Directors, may be disruptive to, or cause uncertainty in, our business, and any additional changes to the management team or the Board of Directors could have a negative impact on our ability to manage and grow our business effectively. In addition, if we are not effective in our succession planning, it may have a negative impact on our ability to successfully recruit for our management team. Any such disruption or uncertainty or difficulty in efficiently and effectively filling key manageme nt roles could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and/or the price of our common stock. Unionization activities or labor disputes may disrupt our operations and affect our profitability. Although none of our employees are currently covered under collective bargaining agreements, we cannot guarantee that our employees will not elect to be represented by labor unions in the future. If some or all of our employees were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were significantly different from our current compensation arrangements, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, a labor dispute involving some or all of our employees may disrupt our operations and reduce our revenues, and resolution of disputes may increase our costs. Although we maintain binding policies that require employees to submit to a mandatory alternative dispute resolution procedure in lieu of other remedies, as employers, we may be subject to various employment-related claims, such as individual or class actions or government enforcement actions relating to alleged employment discrimination, employee classification and related withholding, wage-hour, labor standards or healthcare and benefit issues. Such actions, if brought against us and successful in whole or in part, may affect our ability to compete or materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our business depends on our ability to meet our workforce needs. Our success depends on our ability to attract, train, motivate and retain qualified employees to keep pace with our needs, including employees with certain specialized skills in the field of animal training and care. If we are unable to do so, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected. 25 In addition, we employ a significant seasonal workforce. We recruit year-round to fill thousands of seasonal staffing positions each season and work to manage seasonal wages and the timing of the hiring process to ensure the appropriate workforce is in place. There is no assurance that we will be able to recruit and hire adequate seasonal personnel as the business requires or that we will not experience material increases in the cost of securing our seasonal workforce in the future. Increased seasonal wages or an inadequate workforce could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. See also, “ Increased labor costs and employee health and welfare benefits may negatively impact our operations.” We may not realize the benefits of developments, restructurings, acquisitions or other strategic initiatives and we may incur significant costs associated with such activities. Our business strategy may include selective expansion, both domestically and internationally, through acquisitions of assets or other strategic initiatives, such as joint ventures, that allow us to profitably expand our business and leverage our brands. For example, in 2016 we announced our partnership with Miral Asset Management LLC to develop SeaWorld Abu Dhabi, a first-of-its-kind marine life themed park on Yas Island. There is no assurance that the Miral partnership or our other strategic initiatives will be successful. In addition, on March 24, 2017, we entered into a Park Exclusivity and Concept Design Agreement and a Center Concept & Preliminary Design Support Agreement with an affiliate of ZHG Group to provide design, support and advisory services for various potential projects and granting exclusive rights in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau (collectively, the “ZHG Agreements”). The ZHG Agreements were terminated in April 2019 as a result of the contract party’s defaulting on the payment of required amounts under these agreements. Any international transactions and partnerships are subject to additional risks, including foreign and U.S. regulations on the import and export of animals, the impact of economic fluctuations in economies outside of the United States, difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations due to distance, language and cultural differences, as well as political instability and lesser degree of legal protection in certain jurisdictions, currency exchange fluctuations and potentially adverse tax consequences of overseas operations. In addition, the success of any acquisition depends on effective integration of acquired businesses and assets into our operations, which is subject to risks and uncertainties, including realization of anticipated synergies and cost savings, the ability to retain and attract personnel, the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns, and undisclosed or potential legal liabilities of acquired businesses or assets. We are executing on a strategic plan to grow revenue and Adjusted EBITDA and, from time to time, identify and execute on cost reduction opportunities and take other actions designed to achieve operational efficiencies and process improvements. There is no assurance that we will be able to achieve and/or sustain the cost savings, grow our business, realize or sustain operational efficiencies or achieve other benefits that we may initially expect. In addition, such actions may result in various one-time costs and temporary operational inefficiencies and could negatively impact business and employment relationships during transitional periods. See further discussion under the caption “ Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations―Principal Factors and Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations―Costs and Expenses ” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If we are unable to maintain certain commercial licenses, our business, reputation and brand could be adversely affected. We rely on a license from Sesame to use the Sesame Place trade name and trademark and certain other intellectual property rights, including titles, marks, characters, logos and designs from the Sesame Street television series within our Sesame Place theme park located in Langhorne, Pennsylvania (the “Langhorne Sesame Place”), the Sesame Place theme park we announced that will be opened in California and any additional future Sesame Place theme parks in the United States (collectively, the “Standalone Parks”) and with respect to Sesame Street themed areas within certain areas of some of our other theme parks, as well as in connection with the sales of certain Sesame Street themed products. The License Agreement with Sesame Workshop (the “Sesame License Agreement”) has an initial term through December 31, 2031, with an automatic additional 15-year extension plus a 5-year option added from each new Standalone Park opening. Our use of these intellectual property rights is subject to the approval of Sesame and the parties have certain termination rights under the Sesame License Agreement, including without limitation Sesame’s right to terminate the Sesame License Agreement in whole or in part under certain limited circumstances, including a change of control of SeaWorld (or of SeaWorld Parks and Entertainment, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of SeaWorld), our bankruptcy or uncured breach of the Sesame License Agreement, or the termination of the Sesame License Agreement regarding the Langhorne Sesame Place theme park. If we were to lose or have to renegotiate the Sesame License Agreement, our business may be adversely affected. ABI is the owner of the Busch Gardens trademarks and domain names. ABI has granted us a perpetual, exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use the Busch Gardens trademark and certain related domain names in connection with the operation, marketing, promotion and advertising of certain of our theme parks, as well as in connection with the production, use, distribution and sale of merchandise sold in connection with such theme parks. Under the license, we are required to indemnify ABI against losses related to our use of the marks. If we were to lose or have to renegotiate this license, our business may be adversely affected. 26 Our existing debt agreements contain, and future debt agreements may contain, restrictions that may limit our flexibility in operating our business. Our existing debt agreements contain, and documents governing our future indebtedness may contain, financial and operating covenants that limit the discretion of management with respect to certain business matters. These covenants place restrictions on, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends and other distributions, make capital expenditures, make certain loans, investments and other restricted payments, enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends, engage in certain transactions with stockholders or affiliates, sell certain assets or engage in mergers, acquisitions and other business combinations, amend or otherwise alter the terms of our indebtedness, alter the business that we conduct, guarantee indebtedness or incur other contingent obligations and create liens. Our existing debt agreements also require, and documents governing our future indebtedness may require, us to meet certain financial ratios and tests. Our ability to comply with these and other provisions of the existing debt agreements is dependent on our future performance, which will be subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control. The breach of any of these covenants or non-compliance with any of these financial ratios and tests could result in an event of default under the existing debt agreements, which, if not cured or waived, could result in acceleration of the related debt and the acceleration of debt under other instruments evidencing indebtedness that may contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions. We discuss certain key covenants and financial ratios to which we are subject under our debt agreements in greater detail under the caption “Restrictive Covenants” in Note 11–Long-Term Debt to our accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and under “ Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations―Our Indebtedness―Covenant Compliance ”. Additionally, variable rate indebtedness subjects us to the risk of higher interest rates, which could cause our future debt service obligations to increase significantly. Changes to, or the elimination of, LIBOR may adversely affect interest expense related to our indebtedness. Borrowings under our Term B-5 Loans which mature on March 31, 2024, and the Revolving Credit Facility which matures on October 31, 2023 are currently based on LIBOR. We have also hedged approximately $1.0 billion of LIBOR based debt which matures on May 14, 2020. In July 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), a regulator of financial services firms and financial markets in the United Kingdom, stated that it will plan for a phase out of regulatory oversight of LIBOR interest rates indices. The FCA has indicated it will support the LIBOR indices through 2021, to allow for an orderly transition to an alternative reference rate. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate any credit agreements or hedge transactions extending beyond 2021 that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established. Also, if we intend to hedge our LIBOR denominated debt, we cannot predict whether hedging opportunities will exist on acceptable terms. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee, which was charged with determining a replacement for LIBOR, has proposed the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), as its recommended alternative to LIBOR. Subsequent to that recommendation, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2018-16, Derivatives and Hedging which includes SOFR as a permitted rates that can be used in the application of hedge accounting pursuant to adoption of the standard (see Note–3 Recent Accounting Pronouncements to our accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual report on Form 10-K for further discussion). The Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing SOFR rates in April 2018. SOFR is intended to be a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities. The market transition away from LIBOR is expected to be gradual and complicated, and to include the development of term and credit adjustments to accommodate differences between LIBOR and SOFR. There can be no guarantee that SOFR will become widely used or that alternatives may be developed without additional complications. We are not able to predict whether LIBOR will cease to be available after 2021, whether SOFR will become a widely accepted benchmark in place of LIBOR, or what the impact of such a possible transition from LIBOR may be on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds, related margins, liquidity, and access to capital markets. Moody’s Investor Service and Standard & Poor’s Financial Services routinely evaluate our debt and issue ratings on our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. These ratings are based on a number of factors, which included their assessment of our financial strength, liquidity, capital structure, asset quality, and sustainability of cash flow and earnings. Due to changes in these factors and market conditions, we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings, which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins, liquidity and access to capital markets. For example, as of December 31, 2019, our Senior Secured Credit Facilities were rated by Standard and Poor’s Financial Services (corporate credit rated B+ with a stable outlook and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities rated B+) and Moody’s Investors Service (corporate family rated B2 with a stable outlook and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities rated B2). We disclose these ratings to enhance the understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effects of these ratings on our costs of funds and related margins, liquidity and access to capital markets. Our borrowing costs depend, in part, on our credit ratings and any actions taken by these credit rating agencies to lower our credit ratings, could increase our borrowing costs. 27 Our leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness. As of December 31, 2019, our total indebtedness was approximately $1.558 billion. Our high degree of leverage could have important consequences, including the following: (i) a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations is dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available for operations, capital expenditures, future business opportunities and/or share repurchases of our common stock; (ii) our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate purposes in the future may be limited; (iii) certain of the borrowings are at variable rates of interest, which will increase our vulnerability to increases in interest rates; (iv) we are at a competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors; (v) we may be unable to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions; (vi) the debt service requirements of our other indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations; and (vii) we may be vulnerable in a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business and we may be unable to carry out activities that are important to our growth. Additionally, we have hedged approximately $1.0 billion of LIBOR based debt which matures on May 14, 2020. If we allow the interest rate swap agreements to expire without a replacement, a hypothetical increase in LIBOR of 100 bps would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $15.5 million, beginning in May 2020. Increased debt service costs would adversely affect our cash flow. There can be no assurance that when the interest rate swap agreements expire that we will be able to enter into similar replacement hedging arrangements on favorable terms or at all. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, or to pay interest on, or to refinance indebtedness depends on and is subject to our financial and operating performance, which in turn is affected by general and regional economic, financial, competitive, business and other factors beyond our control, including the availability of financing in the banking and capital markets. If unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs, we will need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity. There can be no assurance that any refinancing of our indebtedness will be possible and any such refinancing could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants that could further restrict our business operations. We from time to time may increase the amount of our indebtedness, modify the terms of our financing arrangements, make capital expenditures, issue dividends and take other actions that may substantially increase our leverage. Despite our significant leverage, we may incur significant additional amounts of debt, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our significant leverage. Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that we could suffer and our insurance costs may increase. Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that we could suffer and our insurance costs may increase. Although we maintain various safety and loss prevention programs and carry property and casualty insurance to cover certain risks, our insurance policies do not cover all types of losses and liabilities. Additionally, many of our policies are subject to deductibles and/or self-insured retentions and co-insurance. There can be no assurance our insurance will be sufficient to cover the full extent of all losses or liabilities for which we are insured and may be significantly less than the expected and actual replacement cost of rebuilding facilities “as was” if there was a total loss. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew our current insurance policies on favorable terms, or at all. In addition, if we or other theme park operators sustain significant losses or make significant insurance claims, then our ability to obtain future insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates could be materially adversely affected. We may be unable to purchase or contract with third-party manufacturers for our theme park rides and attractions, or construction delays may occur and impact attraction openings. We may be unable to purchase or contract with third parties to build high quality rides and attractions and to continue to service and maintain those rides and attractions at competitive or beneficial prices, or to provide the replacement parts needed to maintain the operation of such rides. In addition, if our third-party suppliers’ financial condition deteriorates or they go out of business, we may not be able to obtain the full benefit of manufacturer warranties or indemnities typically contained in our contracts or may need to incur greater costs for the maintenance, repair, replacement or insurance of these assets. We may also incur unanticipated construction delays in completing capital projects which could adversely affect ride or attraction opening dates which could impact our attendance or revenues. Further, when rides and/or attractions have downtime and/or closures, our attendance or revenue could be adversely affected. Our operations and our ownership of property subject us to environmental requirements, and to environmental expenditures and liabilities. We incur costs to comply with environmental requirements, such as those relating to water use, wastewater and storm water management and disposal, air emissions control, hazardous materials management, solid and hazardous waste disposal, and the clean-up of properties affected by regulated materials. 28 We have been required and continue to investigate and clean-up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases, and other releases, from current or formerly owned or operated facilities. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we generate, use and dispose of large volumes of water, including saltwater, which requires us to comply with a number of federal, state and local regulations and to incur significant expenses. Failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to fines and penalties and/or require us to incur additional expenses. Although we are not now classified as a large quantity generator of hazardous waste, we do store and handle hazardous materials to operate and maintain our equipment and facilities and have done so historically. We cannot assure you that we will not incur substantial costs to comply with new or expanded environmental requirements in the future or to investigate or clean-up new or newly identified environmental conditions, which could also impair our ability to use or transfer the affected properties and to obtain financing. The suspension or termination of any of our business licenses, including by legislation at federal, state or local levels, may have a negative impact on our business. We maintain a variety of business licenses issued by federal, state and local authorities that are renewable on a periodic basis. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in renewing all of our licenses on a periodic basis. The suspension, termination or expiration of one or more of these licenses could materially adversely affect our revenues and profits. In addition, any changes to the licensing requirements for any of our licenses could affect our ability to maintain the licenses or increase the cost of retaining the license. Delays, restrictions or inability to obtain or maintain permits for capital investments could impair our business. Our capital investments require regulatory permits from one or more governmental agencies in order to improve existing or build new theme parks, rides, attractions and shows. Such permits are typically issued by state agencies, but federal and local governmental permits may also be required. The requirements for such permits vary depending on the location of such capital investments. As with all governmental permitting processes, there is a degree of uncertainty as to whether a permit will be granted, the time it will take for a permit to be issued, and the conditions that may be imposed in connection with the granting of the permit. Therefore, our capital investments in certain areas may be delayed, interrupted or suspended for varying lengths of time, causing a loss of revenue to us, increasing cost and/or adversely affecting our results of operations. Financial distress experienced by our strategic partners or other counterparties could have an adverse impact on us. We are party to numerous contracts of varying durations. Certain of our agreements are comprised of a mixture of firm and non-firm commitments, varying tenures and varying renewal terms, among other terms. There can be no guarantee that, upon the expiration of our contracts, we will be able to renew such contracts on terms as favorable to us, or at all. Although we attempt to assess the creditworthiness of our strategic partners and other contract counterparties, there can be no assurance as to the creditworthiness of any such strategic partner or contract counterparty. Financial distress experienced by our strategic partners or other counterparties could have an adverse impact in the event such parties are unable to pay us for the services we provide or otherwise fulfill their contractual obligations. We are exposed to the risk of loss in the event of non-performance by such strategic partners or other counterparties. Some of these counterparties may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating, market and regulatory risks, and some are experiencing, or may experience in the future, severe financial problems that have had or may have a significant impact on their creditworthiness. For example, we terminated the ZHG Agreements for non-payment of undisputed amounts owed. In addition, the sale or transfer of our common stock owned by affiliates of Hill Path, or the perception that such sales or transfers could occur, could harm the prevailing market price of shares of our common stock. We cannot provide any assurance that our strategic partners and other contractual counterparties will not become financially distressed or that such financially distressed strategic partners or counterparties will not default on their obligations to us or file for bankruptcy or other creditor protection. If one of such strategic partners or counterparties files for bankruptcy or other creditor protection, we may be unable to collect all, or even a significant portion, of amounts owed to us. Contracts with such strategic partners or counterparties could also be subject to renegotiation or rejection under applicable provisions of bankruptcy laws. If any such contract is rejected, we would be left with a general unsecured claim against such contract counterparty’s bankruptcy estate. The recovery rate on general unsecured claims is speculative and inherently uncertain, and it is possible that we may receive little to no recovery on account of such claim. Accordingly, significant strategic partner and other counterparty defaults and bankruptcy filings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Any material nonpayment or nonperformance from our contract counterparties due to inability or unwillingness to perform or adhere to contractual arrangements could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to make cash distributions to its stockholders. Furthermore, in the case of financially distressed strategic partners, such events might otherwise force such strategic partners to curtail their commercial relationships with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. 29 Changes to immigration, foreign trade, investments or other policies of the United States could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Certain policies regarding foreign travel to the United States, foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment could adversely affect our business. For example, policies that strengthen the U.S. dollar against a variety of foreign currencies could impact international tourist spending, including at our theme parks. In addition, foreign tourists may opt to reduce their travel to the United States as a result of policies regarding immigration, foreign trade or other matters, including restrictions on travel and quarantine of visitors from or who have visited certain countries. While uncertainty around the likelihood, timing and details of any such policies and reforms exists, such policies and reforms may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the value of our securities. Goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets represent a significant portion of our total assets, and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets. Our operations are capital intensive and require significant investment in long-lived assets, such as property, equipment and other long-lived assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant portion of our assets. We review goodwill and intangible assets at least annually for impairment. Impairment may result from, among other things, deterioration in park performance, adverse competitive conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations, including changes that restrict our activities or affect the services we offer, challenges to the validity of our intellectual property and a variety of other factors. For example, in 2017 due to financial performance at the time at our SeaWorld Orlando park, we determined a triggering event had occurred that required an interim goodwill impairment test. Based on the results of the interim goodwill impairment test, we concluded that the goodwill for the SeaWorld Orlando reporting unit was fully impaired which resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of $269.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. See Note 9–Goodwill, Trade Names/Trademarks, and Other Intangible Assets, Net, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. There is no assurance that we will not experience similar asset impairments in the future. Any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets would result in a non-cash charge against earnings, which would adversely affect our results of operations. Changes to tax laws may result in a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial condition. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), was enacted on December 22, 2017, and contains a number of changes to U.S. federal tax laws. The Tax Act requires complex computations that were not previously provided for under U.S. tax law and significantly revised the U.S. tax code by, among other changes, lowering the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and imposing limitations on the deductibility of interest. Additional guidance may be issued by the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, the Department of the Treasury, or other governing body that may significantly differ from our interpretation of the law, which may result in a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial conditions . Tariffs or other trade restrictions could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We purchase some of our merchandise for resale and other products used in our business from entities which are located in foreign countries. Additionally, some of our ride manufacturers may be located in foreign countries or utilize components manufactured or sourced from foreign countries. These relationships expose us to risks associated with doing business globally, including changes in tariffs, quotas and other restrictions on imports (collectively, “Trade Restrictions”). Beginning in 2018, the United States began imposing increased tariffs on certain imports from China. While the current tariffs have not had a material impact on goods that we currently either import from China or purchase from domestic vendors which import from China, we cannot predict how any future tariffs or any other Trade Restrictions will impact our business. Such Trade Restrictions would likely result in lower gross margin on impacted products, unless we are able to take successfully any one or more of the following mitigating actions: increase our prices, move production to countries with no or lower tariffs or away from domestic vendors who source from China or other tariff impacted countries, or alter or cease offering certain products. Any increase in pricing, alteration of products or reduced product offering could reduce the competitiveness of our products. Furthermore, any retaliatory counter-measures imposed by countries subject to such tariffs, such as China, could increase our, or our vendors’, import expenses. Additionally, even if the products we import are not directly impacted by tariffs, the imposition and maintenance of such tariffs on goods imported into the United States could cause increased prices for consumer goods, in general, which could have a negative impact on consumer spending for discretionary items reducing attendance or spending at our parks. These direct and indirect impacts of increased tariffs or Trade Restrictions implemented by the United States, both individually and cumulatively, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of future operations. 30 Actions of activist stockholders, and such activism could adversely impact the value of our securities . We value constructive input from our stockholders and the investment community. Our Board and management team are committed to acting in the best interests of all of our stockholders. There is no assurance that the actions taken by our Board of Directors and management in seeking to maintain constructive engagement with our stockholders will be successful. Responding to actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management and our employees. Such activities could also interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plan and our long-term growth. The perceived uncertainties as to our future direction caused by activist actions could affect the market price of our securities, result in the loss of potential business opportunities and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, board members and business partners. In addition, any interference with our annual meeting process, including but not limited to a proxy contest for the election of directors at our annual meeting, could require us to incur significant legal and other advisory fees and proxy solicitation expenses and require significant time and attention by management and our Board. Affiliates of Hill Path Capital LP could be able to significantly influence our decisions and their interests may conflict with ours or yours in the future. On May 27, 2019, Hill Path Capital LP and certain of its affiliates (“Hill Path”) agreed to purchase in the aggregate, 13,214,000 shares of our common stock (the “HP Purchase”). As described more fully in our Form 8-K dated May 27, 2019, we concurrently entered into the Stockholders Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement and the Undertaking Agreement (collectively, the “HP Agreements”) with Hill Path in connection with the HP Purchase. On December 13, 2019, Hill Path filed with the SEC a Schedule 13D/A (the “Schedule 13D/A”) reporting that such persons had accumulated a total of 27,212,455 shares of our common stock, which represents approximately 34.6% of our total outstanding shares of common stock as of December 31, 2019. In addition, the Hill Path Schedule 13D filed on May 1, 2017, as amended states, among other things, that Hill Path may suggest changes in our business, operations, capital structure, capital allocation, corporate governance and other strategic matters. Under the HP Agreements, we agreed to appoint up to three Hill Path director designees (“Hill Path Designees”) to our Board of Directors of which two directors may be affiliated with Hill Path and, subject to the independence standards of the New York Stock Exchange, there shall be one Hill Path Designee on each committee of the Board, as determined by Hill Path and subject to the approval of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Scott Ross, founder of Hill Path, James Chambers, a Partner at Hill Path, and Charles Koppelman, who is independent, are the Hill Path Designees. Mr. Ross currently serves as Chairman of the Board and Chairman of the Compensation Committee and also serves on the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Revenue Committee. Mr. Chambers serves as Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and also serves on the Compensation Committee and the Revenue Committee. For so long as Hill Path Designees remain on our Board, Hill Path will have influence with respect to our management, business plans and policies, including the appointment and removal of our officers, and nominees for director. In addition, for so long as Hill Path continues to own a significant percentage of our stock, Hill Path will be able to influence the composition of our Board of Directors and the approval of actions requiring stockholder approval. For example, for so long as Hill Path continues to own a significant percentage of our stock, Hill Path may be able to influence whether or not a change of control of our Company or a change in the composition of our Board of Directors occurs. The concentration of ownership could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of common stock as part of a sale of our Company and ultimately might affect the market price of our common stock. Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock Our stock price may change significantly, and you may not be able to sell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid or at all, and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result. The trading price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile. Since shares of our common stock were sold in our IPO in April 2013 through December 31, 2019, our common stock close price has ranged from $10.61 to $38.92. In addition to the risk factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the trading price of our common stock may be adversely affected due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: • results of operations that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors; • results of operations that vary from those of our competitors; • changes in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates and investment recommendations by securities analysts and investors; • declines in the market prices of stocks generally, or those of amusement and theme parks companies; • strategic actions by us or our competitors; 31 • announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, new products, acquisitions, joint marketing relationships, joint ventures, other strategic relationships or capital commitments; • changes in general economic or market conditions or trends in our industry or markets; • changes in business or regulatory conditions; • future sales of our common stock or other securities; • repurchases of our common stock; • investor perceptions or the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment alternatives; • the public’s response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the SEC; • rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry, particularly with respect to strategic transactions; • announcements relating to litigation; • guidance, if any, that we provide to the public, any changes in this guidance or our failure to meet this guidance; • the development and sustainability of an active trading market for our stock; • actions by institutional or activist stockholders; • changes in accounting principles; and • other events or factors, including those resulting from natural disasters, war, acts of terrorism or responses to these events. We cannot guarantee that our allocation of capital to various alternatives will enhance long-term stockholder value, and in some cases, our Share Repurchase Program could increase the volatility of the price of our common stock. Our goal is to invest capital to maximize our overall long-term returns. This includes spending on capital projects and expenses, managing debt levels, and periodically returning capital to our stockholders through share repurchases and dividends. There can be no assurance that our capital allocation decisions will enhance stockholder value. During 2019, we repurchased a total of 5,615,874 shares of common stock at a total cost of approximately $150.0 million. On August 2, 2019, our Board authorized a replenishment to our Share Repurchase Program, bringing the total amount authorized for future share repurchases to $250.0 million as of December 31, 2019. The number of shares to be purchased and the timing of purchases will be based on our trading windows and available liquidity, general business and market conditions and other factors, including legal requirements and alternative opportunities. During 2018, we repurchased a total of 3,654,816 shares of common stock at a total cost of approximately $98.0 million. There were no share repurchases during the year ended December 31, 2017. Repurchases of our common stock pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. The existence of the Share Repurchase Program could cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. There can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock. Although the Share Repurchase Program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, there is no assurance that it will do so and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce such program’s effectiveness. If securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our stock or our sector, our stock price and trading volume could decline. The trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We do not control these analysts. Furthermore, if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrade our stock or our industry, or the stock of any of our competitors, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Future sales, or the perception of future sales, by us or our existing stockholders in the public market could cause the market price for our common stock to decline. The sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could harm the prevailing market price of shares of our common stock. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. 32 Shares held by Hill Path and certain of our directors, officers and employees are eligible for resale, subject to volume, manner of sale and other limitations under Rule 144. In addition, pursuant to a registration rights agreement entered into in connection with the HP Purchase, we granted Hill Path the right, subject to certain conditions, to require us to register the sale of their shares of common stock under the Securities Act. If Hill Path exercises their registration rights, the market price of our shares of common stock could drop significantly if the holders of these shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through future offerings of our shares of common stock or other securities. In addition, the shares of our common stock reserved for future issuance under the 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan will become eligible for sale in the public market once those shares are issued, subject to provisions relating to various vesting agreements, any applicable lock-up agreements in effect from time to time and Rule 144, as applicable. A total of 15,000,000 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under the 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan, of which approximately 8,480,000 shares of common stock remain available for future issuance as of December 31, 2019. In the future, we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions. The amount of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of our common stock. Any issuance of additional securities in connection with investments or acquisitions may result in additional dilution to you. We have suspended the dividend on our common stock, and our indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock in the future. In September 2016, our Board suspended our quarterly dividend to allow us greater flexibility to deploy capital to opportunities that offer the greatest long term returns to stockholders, such as, but not limited to, share repurchases, investments in new attractions or debt repayments. Future dividends, if any, and the timing of declaration of any such dividends, will be at the discretion of the Board and will depend upon many factors, including, but not limited to, our results of operations, financial condition, level of indebtedness, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, restrictions in our debt agreements and in any preferred stock, business prospects and other factors that the Board deems relevant. Our ability to declare dividends and make other restricted payments is limited by covenants in our senior secured credit facilities pursuant to a credit agreement dated as of December 1, 2009, as the same may be amended, restated, supplemented or modified from time to time (the “Senior Secured Credit Facilities”). The fiscal amount available for dividend declarations, share repurchases and other restricted payments under the covenant restrictions in the debt agreements adjusts at the beginning of each quarter. See Note 11–Long-Term Debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control. Certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, defer or prevent a merger, acquisition, tender offer, takeover attempt or other change of control transaction that a stockholder might consider in its best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by our stockholders. These provisions provide for, among other things: • the ability of our Board of Directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock; • advance notice for nominations of directors by stockholders and for stockholders to include matters to be considered at our annual meetings; • certain limitations on convening special stockholder meetings; • the removal of directors with or without cause only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66.67% in voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of our stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class; and • that certain provisions may be amended only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66.67% in voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of our stock entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class. These anti-takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if the third-party’s offer may be considered beneficial by many of our stockholders. As a result, our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares. 33 The concentration of ownership of our capital stock limits your ability to influence corporate matters. Our executive officers, directors, current 5% or greater stockholders and entities affiliated with them beneficially owned (as determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC) approximately 47.0% of our common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2019. This significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with controlling stockholders. Also, these stockholders, acting together, may be able to control our management and affairs and matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions, such as mergers, consolidations or the sale of substantially all of our assets. Consequently, this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, including a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control, even if that change of control would benefit our other stockholders. Non-U.S. holders who own or owned more than a certain ownership threshold may be subject to United States federal income tax on gains realized on the disposition of our common stock. We believe that we are currently a U.S. real property holding corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. So long as our common stock continues to be regularly traded on an established securities market, a non-U.S. stockholder who holds or held (at any time during the shorter of the five year period preceding the date of disposition or the holder’s holding period) more than 5% of our common stock will be subject to United States federal income tax on the disposition of our common stock. Non-U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the consequences of disposing of shares of our common stock. 34 Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 2. Properties The following table summarizes our principal properties as of December 31, 2019, which includes approximately 400 acres of land available for future development. Location Size Use San Diego, CA 190 acres (a) Leased Land Chula Vista, CA 66 acres Owned Water Park (b) Orlando, FL 279 acres Owned Theme Park and Corporate Headquarters Orlando, FL 58 acres Owned All-inclusive Interactive Park Orlando, FL 81 acres Owned Water Park Tampa, FL 56 acres Owned Water Park Tampa, FL 306 acres Owned Theme Park Dade City, FL 109 acres Owned Breeding and Holding Facility Langhorne, PA 55 acres Owned Theme Park San Antonio, TX 397 acres Owned Theme Park San Antonio, TX 18 acres Owned Water Park Williamsburg, VA 222 acres Owned Water Park Williamsburg, VA 422 acres Owned Theme Park Williamsburg, VA 5 acres Owned Warehouse Space Williamsburg, VA 5 acres Owned Seasonal Worker Lodging (a) Includes approximately 17 acres of water in Mission Bay Park, California. (b) To be converted to Sesame Place in spring of 2021. We believe that our properties are in good operating condition and adequately serve our current business operations. Lease Agreement with City of San Diego Our subsidiary, Sea World LLC (f/k/a Sea World Inc.), leases approximately 190 acres from the City of San Diego, including approximately 17 acres of water in Mission Bay Park, California (the “Premises”). The current lease term commenced on July 1, 1998 and extends for 50 years or the maximum period allowed by law. Under the lease, the Premises must be used as a marine park facility and related uses. In addition, we may not operate another marine park facility within a radius of 560 miles from the City of San Diego. The annual rent under the lease is calculated on the basis of a specified percentage of Sea World LLC’s gross income from the Premises, or the minimum yearly rent, whichever is greater. The minimum yearly rent is adjusted every three years to an amount equal to 80% of the average accounting year rent actually paid for the three previous years. The current minimum yearly rent is approximately $10.4 million, which is subject to adjustment on January 1, 2023. 35 Item 3. Legal Proceedings We are subject to various allegations, claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. While it is impossible to determine with certainty the ultimate outcome of any of these proceedings, lawsuits and claims, management believes that adequate provisions have been made and insurance secured for all currently pending proceedings so that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position. Securities Class Action Lawsuits On September 9, 2014, a purported stockholder class action lawsuit consisting of purchasers of the Company’s common stock during the periods between April 18, 2013 and August 13, 2014, captioned Baker v. SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc., et al., Case No. 14-CV-02129-MMA (KSC), was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California against the Company, the Chairman of the Company’s Board, certain of its executive officers and Blackstone. On February 17, 2015, Court-appointed Lead Plaintiffs, Pensionskassen For Børne- Og Ungdomspædagoger and Arkansas Public Employees Retirement System, together with additional plaintiffs, Oklahoma City Employee Retirement System and Pembroke Pines Firefighters and Police Officers Pension Fund (collectively, “Plaintiffs”), then filed an amended complaint against the Company, the Chairman of the Company’s Board, certain of its executive officers, Blackstone, and underwriters of the initial public offering and secondary public offerings. The amended complaint alleges, among other things, that the prospectus and registration statements filed contained materially false and misleading information in violation of the federal securities laws and seeks unspecified compensatory damages and other relief. Plaintiffs contend that defendants knew or were reckless in not knowing that the film Blackfish was impacting SeaWorld’s business at the time of each public statement. On May 31, 2016, Plaintiffs filed a second amended consolidated class action complaint, which, among other things, no longer names the Company’s Board or underwriters as defendants. On February 11, 2020, the Company announced that it had entered into a settlement agreement relating to this case. The proposed settlement, which is subject to certain conditions, including court approval, requires the Company to pay $65.0 million for claims alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as the costs of administration and legal fees and expenses. The proposed settlement does not include or constitute an admission, concession, or finding of any fault, liability, or wrongdoing by the Company or any defendant. There can be no assurance that the proposed settlement agreement will be approved by the court. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded $32.1 million of legal settlement charges, net of insurance recoveries, related to this case, which is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. On June 14, 2018, a lawsuit captioned Highfields Capital I LP et al. v. SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. et al., Case No. 3:18-cv-01276-L-BLM, was filed in the United States District Court in the Southern District of California against the Company and certain of the Company’s former and present executive officers (collectively, the “Defendants”). The plaintiffs, which are investment funds managed by a common adviser (collectively, the “Plaintiffs”) allege, among other things, that the Defendants made false and misleading statements in violation of the federal securities laws and Florida common law, regarding the impact of the film Blackfish on SeaWorld’s business. The complaint further alleges that such statements were made to induce Plaintiffs to purchase common stock of the Company at artificially-inflated prices and that Plaintiffs suffered investment losses as a result. The Plaintiffs are seeking unspecified compensatory damages and other relief. On October 19, 2018, Defendants moved for partial dismissal of the complaint. On February 7, 2019, the Court granted Defendants’ motion, and dismissed Plaintiffs’ Florida state law claims as well as federal securities law claims based on the Company’s second quarter 2013 earnings statements. On May 1, 2019, Defendants filed their answer to Plaintiffs’ complaint. On July 1, 2019, the parties filed a joint motion for a stay of all proceedings in the case pending the resolution of the motion for summary judgment filed by Defendants in the related securities class action captioned Baker v. SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc., et al. described above. The Company believes that the lawsuit is without merit and intends to defend the lawsuit vigorously; however, there can be no assurance regarding the ultimate outcome of this lawsuit. Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit On December 8, 2014, a putative derivative lawsuit captioned Kistenmacher v. Atchison, et al., Civil Action No. 10437, was filed in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware against, among others, the Chairman of the Company’s Board, certain of the Company’s executive officers, directors and shareholders, and Blackstone. The Company is a “Nominal Defendant” in the lawsuit. 36 On March 30, 2015, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint against the same set of defendants. The amended complaint alleges, among other things, that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties, aided and abetted breaches of fiduciary duties, violated Florida Blue Sky laws and were unjustly enriched by (i) including materially false and misleading information in the prospectus and registration statements; and (ii) causing the Company to repurchase certain shares of its common stock from certain shareholders at an alleged artificially inflated price. The Company does not maintain any direct exposure to loss in connection with this shareholder derivative lawsuit as the lawsuit does not assert any claims against the Company. The Company’s status as a “Nominal Defendant” in the action reflects the fact that the lawsuit is maintained by the named plaintiff on behalf of the Company and that the plaintiff seeks damages on the Company’s behalf On February 11, 2020, the Company announced that it had entered into a binding agreement for the settlement of this case. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company received $12.5 million of insurance proceeds from its insurers which can be used for general corporate purposes and will adopt certain corporate governance modifications. The final settlement of the matter remains subject to a formal agreement and court approval. There can be no assurance that the final settlement agreement will be executed or that such agreement will be approved by the court. In the first quarter of 2020, the Company expects to record a legal settlement gain of $12.5 million related to insurance proceeds received. Consumer Lawsuit On April 13, 2015, a purported class action was filed in the Superior Court of the State of California for the City and County of San Francisco against SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc., captioned Marc Anderson, et. al., v. SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc. Civil Case No. 15-cv-02172-JSW, (the “Anderson Matter”). The putative class consisted of all consumers within California who, within the past four years, purchased tickets to SeaWorld San Diego. The complaint (as amended) alleges causes of action under the California False Advertising Law, California Unfair Competition Law and California CLRA. Plaintiffs’ claims are based on their allegations that the Company misrepresented the physical living conditions and care and treatment of its killer whales, resulting in confusion or misunderstanding among ticket and orca plush purchasers with intent to deceive and mislead the plaintiffs and purported class members. The complaint seeks restitution, equitable relief, attorneys’ fees and costs. Based on plaintiffs’ definition of the class, the amount in controversy could have exceeded $5.0 million assuming the class became certified. The liability exposure is speculative though. On May 14, 2015, the Company removed the case to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The Company filed a motion for summary judgment on October 30, 2017 which the Court granted in part and denied in part. On May 23, 2018, the plaintiffs represented to the Court that they will not file a motion for class certification. The case is no longer a class action. All three named plaintiffs continue to have claims for individual restitution in a nominal amount and injunctive relief. The Court bifurcated the trial of the case into two phases: the plaintiffs’ standing to sue and the merits of their claims. The standing trial is scheduled for March 9, 2020, after which the Court will determine if there needs to be a trial on the merits which currently is scheduled for April 27, 2020. Pre-trial motions and mediation proceedings are continuing. The Company believes that the lawsuit is without merit and intends to defend the lawsuit vigorously; however, there can be no assurance regarding the ultimate outcome of this lawsuit. EZPay Plan Class Action Lawsuit On December 3, 2014, a purported class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division against SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc. The case, captioned Jason Herman, Joey Kratt, and Christina Lancaster, as individuals and on behalf of all others similarly situated, v. SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc. Case no: 8:14-cv-03028-MSS-JSS was certified as a class action in 2018. The Court certified a class action on two claims for relief -- breach of contract and violation of federal Electronic Funds Transfer Act, 15 U.S.C. section 1693 et seq. on behalf of three individual plaintiffs and two classes: (i) individuals in the states of Florida, Texas, Virginia and California who paid for an annual pass through EZ pay in “less than twelve months,” had their passes automatically renewed and did not use the renewed passes after the first year or were not issued a full refund of payments made after the twelfth payment; and (ii) all of these same individuals who used debit cards. In April 2018, the Company reached a preliminary agreement in principle to settle this matter for a payment of $11.5 million into a common fund, plus certain administrative costs and expenses associated with the proposed settlement. At a fairness hearing held April 18, 2019, the Court approved the settlement. On April 29, 2019, the Court entered an order approving the final settlement. The Company has funded the $11.5 million settlement and is working with a class action administrator to facilitate the settlement in accordance with the terms of the settlement agreement. 37 Other Matters The Company is a party to various other claims and legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business. In addition, from time to time the Company is subject to audits, inspections and investigations by, or receives requests for information from, various federal and state regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”), the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“Cal-OSHA”), the Florida Fish & Wildlife Commission (“FWC”), the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”), the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Other than those matters discussed above, from time to time, various parties also bring other lawsuits against the Company. Matters where an unfavorable outcome to the Company is probable and which can be reasonably estimated are accrued. Such accruals, which are not material for any period presented, are based on information known about the matters, the Company’s estimate of the outcomes of such matters, and the Company’s experience in contesting, litigating and settling similar matters. Matters that are considered reasonably possible to result in a material loss are not accrued for, but an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss is disclosed, if such amount or range can be determined. At this time, management does not expect any such known claims, legal proceedings or regulatory matters to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. You should carefully read “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors.” The following discussion generally discusses 2019 and 2018 items and the applicable year-to-year comparisons. Management’s discussion and analysis relating to 2017 and the applicable year-to-year comparisons are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K but can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 , which specific discussion is incorporated herein by reference. Business Overview We are a leading theme park and entertainment company providing experiences that matter and inspiring guests to protect animals and the wild wonders of our world. We own or license a portfolio of recognized brands, including SeaWorld, Busch Gardens, Aquatica, Discovery Cove and Sesame Place. Over our more than 60-year history, we have developed a diversified portfolio of 12 differentiated theme parks that are grouped in key markets across the United States. Many of our theme parks showcase our one-of-a-kind zoological collection and feature a diverse array of both thrill and family-friendly rides, educational presentations, shows and/or other attractions with broad demographic appeal which deliver memorable experiences and a strong value proposition for our guests. Principal Factors and Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations Revenues Our revenues are driven primarily by attendance in our theme parks and the level of per capita spending for admission and per capita spending for culinary, merchandise and other in-park products. We define attendance as the number of guest visits. Attendance drives admissions revenue as well as total in-park spending. Admissions revenue primarily consists of single-day tickets, annual or season passes (collectively referred to as season passes) or other multi-day or multi-park admission products. Total revenue per capita, defined as total revenue divided by total attendance, consists of admission per capita and in-park per capita spending: • Admission Per Capita. We calculate admission per capita as total admissions revenue divided by total attendance. Admission per capita is primarily driven by ticket pricing, the admissions product mix and the park attendance mix, among other factors. The admissions product mix, also referred to as the visitation mix, is defined as the mix of attendance by ticket category such as single day, multi-day, annual passes or complimentary tickets and can be impacted by the mix of guests as domestic and international guests generally purchase higher admission per capita ticket products than our local guests. The park attendance mix is defined as the mix of theme parks visited and can impact admission per capita based on the theme park’s respective pricing which, on average, is lower for our water parks compared to our other theme parks. • In-Park Per Capita Spending. We calculate in-park per capita spending as total food, merchandise and other revenue divided by total attendance. Food, merchandise and other revenue primarily consists of culinary, merchandise, parking and other in-park products and also includes other miscellaneous revenue not necessarily generated in our parks, which is not significant in the periods presented, including revenue related to our international agreements. In-park per capita spending is primarily driven by pricing changes, new product offerings, the mix of guests (such as local, domestic or international guests), penetration levels (percentage of guests purchasing) and the mix of in-park spending, among other factors. See further discussion in the “ Results of Operations ” section which follows. For other factors affecting our revenues, see the “ Risk Factors ” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Attendance The level of attendance in our theme parks is a function of many factors, including affordability, the opening of new attractions and shows, competitive offerings, weather, marketing and sales efforts, awareness and type of ticket and park offerings, travel patterns of both our domestic and international guests, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and global and regional economic conditions, consumer confidence and the external perceptions of our brands and reputation, among other factors beyond our control. Attendance patterns on a quarterly basis have significant seasonality, driven by the timing of holidays, school vacations, calendar shifts in the number of weekend days in a quarter and weather conditions; in addition, seven of our theme parks are seasonal and only open for part of the year. 42 We believe attendance in recent years was impacted by a variety of factors at some of our parks, including the external perceptions of our brands and reputation, which have also impacted relationships with some of our business partners, including certain ticket resellers that have terminated relationships with us and other zoological-themed attractions. Given current results, we do not believe these factors have had a significant impact on our performance; however, we continuously monitor our external perceptions, making strategic marketing and sales adjustments, as necessary, to address these or any other items that could impact attendance. Costs and Expenses The principal costs of our operations are employee wages and benefits, advertising, maintenance, animal care, utilities and insurance. Factors that affect our costs and expenses include competitive wage pressures including minimum wage legislation, commodity prices, costs for construction, repairs and maintenance, other inflationary pressures and attendance levels, among other factors. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded $32.1 million related to a legal settlement charge, net of insurance recoveries, which is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Note 15–Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. We continue to focus on reducing costs, improving operating margins and streamlining our management structure to create efficiencies to better align with our strategic business objectives. We remain committed to continuous improvement and regularly evaluate operations to ensure we are properly organized for performance and efficiency. As part of these ongoing efforts, during the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded approximately $4.2 million in pre-tax charges primarily consisting of severance and other termination benefits which is included in severance and other separation costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded approximately $17.4 million in pre-tax charges primarily consisting of severance and other termination benefits related to certain executives and employees who separated from us in 2018. See Note 21–Severance and Other Separation Costs to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. We make annual investments to support and improve our existing theme park facilities and attractions. Maintaining and improving our theme parks, as well as opening new attractions, is critical to remain competitive, grow revenue, and increase our guests’ length of stay. For further discussion of our new attractions for 2020, see “ Capital Improvements ” in the “Business” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Seasonality The theme park industry is seasonal in nature. Historically, we generate the highest revenues in the second and third quarters of each year, in part because seven of our theme parks are only open for a portion of the year. Approximately two-thirds of our attendance and revenues are generated in the second and third quarters of the year and we typically incur a net loss in the first and fourth quarters. The percent mix of revenues by quarter is relatively constant each year, but revenues can shift between the first and second quarters due to the timing of Easter and spring break holidays and between the first and fourth quarters due to the timing of holiday breaks around Christmas and New Year. Even for our five theme parks open year-round, attendance patterns have significant seasonality, driven by holidays, school vacations and weather conditions. Regulatory Developments See the discussion of relevant regulatory developments under “ Recent Regulatory Developments ” in the “ Business ” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a discussion of certain risks associated with federal and state regulations governing the treatment of animals, see the “ Risk Factors ” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “ Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry—We are subject to complex federal and state regulations governing the treatment of animals, which can change, and to claims and lawsuits by activist groups before government regulators and in the courts. ” Leadership Changes On November 7, 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors (the “Board”) appointed Sergio (“Serge”) D. Rivera to serve as our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and elected him to serve as a director of the Company. Mr. Rivera assumed his CEO role and director role effective November 11, 2019 (the “Effective Date”). In connection with the appointment of Mr. Rivera as CEO, Marc G. Swanson, who was serving as our Interim CEO, resumed his previous role of Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer and Elizabeth C. Gulacsy, who was serving as our Interim Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer in addition to her role as our Chief Accounting Officer, ceased to serve as our Interim Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, in each case effective on the Effective Date. Ms. Gulacsy continues to serve as our Chief Accounting Officer. 43 Results of Operations The following discussion provides an analysis of our consolidated financial data for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.

Admissions revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $4.0 million, or 0.5%, to $802.8 million as compared to $798.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in admissions revenue was primarily a result of an increase in admission per capita and an increase in attendance of approximately 0.2%. Admission per capita increased to $35.48 in 2019 compared to $35.37 in 2018. The increase in admission per capita was primarily a result of pricing strategies, partially offset by the visitation mix when compared to the prior year. We believe the increased attendance results from a combination of factors including the positive reception of our new rides and compelling attractions and events and enhanced overall marketing, communication and pricing initiatives . These positive factors were largely offset by unfavorable weather compared to 2018, particularly during our peak seasons. Food, merchandise and other revenue . Food, merchandise and other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $21.9 million, or 3.8% to $595.4 million as compared to $573.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase results primarily from an increase in in-park per capita spending and an increase in attendance. In-park per capita spending increased by 3.6%, to $26.32 in 2019 from $25.40 in 2018. In-park per capita spending improved primarily due to pricing initiatives and increased sales of in-park products. Costs of food, merchandise and other revenues. Costs of food, merchandise and other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $2.3 million, or 2.2%, to $109.0 million as compared to $106.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. These costs represent 18.3% and 18.6% of related revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 44 Operating expenses . Operating expenses fo r the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased by $56.3 million, or 8.0% to $649.7 million as compared to $706.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 . The decline in o perating expenses largely relates to a reduction in labor costs primarily as a result of our focus on cost efficiencies and a decrease in non-cash asset write-offs. Operating expenses were 46.5% of total revenues in 2019 compared to 51.4% in 2018 . The decrease as a percent of total revenue results primarily fro m a focus on cost efficiencies and the impact of cost savings initiatives. Selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by $32.0 million, or 13.9% to $261.7 million as compared to $229.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to certain distinct legal, consulting and marketing costs partially offset by a decline in non-cash equity compensation expense and salary and other related costs. Legal costs increased largely related to a legal settlement charge, net of insurance recoveries, of approximately $32.1 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to legal settlement accruals of $12.1 million recorded in 2018. Consulting expenses increased almost entirely due to an increase of approximately $10.4 million in business optimization and other strategic initiative consulting costs. Marketing costs increased largely due to approximately $9.5 million in marketing overspend during the third quarter of 2019 which we believe was due to less disciplined management of certain marketing related costs. Non-cash equity compensation expense declined primarily related to equity awards for certain executives who departed in 2018, while the decline in salary and other related costs was due in part to cost savings initiatives. See Note 15–Commitments and Contingencies and Note 19–Equity-Based Compensation in our notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. As a percentage of total revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses were 18.7% in 2019 compared to 16.7% in 2018. The legal settlement charges, equity compensation, and business optimization and other strategic initiative consulting costs are items that we are permitted to exclude in calculating Adjusted EBITDA under the terms of our credit agreement. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and is defined and reconciled in the “Our Indebtedness” section which follows. Severance and other separation costs. Severance and other separation costs of $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily relates to severance and other termination expenses incurred in 2019. Severance and other separation costs of $17.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 also includes severance and other employment expenses for certain executives and other employees whose employment terminated during 2018, including costs associated with the 2018 Restructuring Program. See Note 21–Severance and Other Separation Costs in our notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased by $0.4 million, or 0.2% to $160.6 million as compared to $161.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Interest expense. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $3.3 million, or 4.0% to $84.2 million as compared to $80.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase primarily relates to the impact of Amendment No. 9 to our Senior Secured Credit Facilities entered into on October 31, 2018 as well as a higher outstanding balance on our Revolving Credit Facility during the year ended December 31, 2019, partially offset by the impact of interest rate swap agreements. See Note 11 –Long-Term Debt to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the “ Our Indebtedness ” section which follows for further details. Loss on early extinguishment of debt and write-off of discounts and debt issuance costs. Loss on early extinguishment of debt and write-off of discounts and debt issuance costs of $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily relates to a write-off of discounts and debt issuance costs resulting from Amendment No. 9 to our Senior Secured Credit Facilities entered into on October 31, 2018. See Note 11–Long-Term Debt to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the “ Our Indebtedness” section which follows for further details. Provision for income taxes. Provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $39.5 million compared to a provision for income taxes of $17.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. Our consolidated effective tax rate was 30.6% for 2019 compared to 28.6% for 2018. The effective tax rate increased primarily due to the valuation allowance on state net operating loss carryforwards and the impact of state statutory rate changes, partially offset by tax benefits relating to deductible equity-based compensation . See Note 14–Income Taxes in our notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. 45 Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Our principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations, funds from borrowings and existing cash on hand. Our principal uses of cash include the funding of working capital obligations, debt service, investments in theme parks (including capital projects), and could also include share repurchases or common stock dividends. As of December 31, 2019, we had a working capital ratio (defined as current assets divided by current liabilities) of 0.4, due in part to a significant deferred revenue balance from revenues paid in advance for our theme park admissions products and high turnover of in-park products that results in a limited inventory balance. We typically operate with a working capital ratio less than 1 and we expect that we will continue to do so in the future. Our cash flow from operations, along with our revolving credit facilities, have allowed us to meet our liquidity needs. As market conditions warrant and subject to our contractual restrictions and liquidity position, we, our affiliates and/or our stockholders, may from time to time purchase our outstanding equity and/or debt securities, including our outstanding bank loans in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Any such purchases may be funded by incurring new debt, including additional borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, as defined. Any new debt may also be secured debt. We may also use available cash on our balance sheet. The amounts involved in any such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. Further, since some of our debt may trade at a discount to the face amount among current or future syndicate members, any such purchases may result in our acquiring and retiring a substantial amount of any particular series, with the attendant reduction in the trading liquidity of any such series. Depending on conditions in the credit and capital markets and other factors, we will, from time to time, consider other financing transactions, the proceeds of which could be used to refinance our indebtedness or for other purposes. Share Repurchases Our Board had previously authorized a share repurchase program of up to $250.0 million of our common stock (the “Share Repurchase Program”). Under the Share Repurchase Program, we are authorized to repurchase shares through open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans and under Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. The Share Repurchase Program has no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued completely at any time. Pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program, during the year ended December 31, 2019, we completed a share repurchase of 5,615,874 shares for an aggregate total cost of $150.0 million. On August 2, 2019, our Board approved a replenishment to the Share Repurchase Program of $150.0 million, bringing the total amount authorized for future share repurchases back up to $250.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we repurchased a total of 3,654,816 shares of common stock at a total cost of approximately $98.0 million. No shares were repurchased during the year ended December 31, 2017. Our Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain certain covenants that, among other things, may restrict our ability for future share repurchases. The available capacity for restricted payments is recalculated at the beginning of each quarter, or upon declaration of a restricted payment as set forth in the credit agreement. See Note 11–Long-Term Debt to our notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. The number of shares to be purchased and the timing of purchases will be based on our trading windows or as set forth in an adopted Rule 10b5-1 plan, if any, and available liquidity, general business and market conditions and other factors, including legal requirements and alternative opportunities. See Note 17–Related Party Transactions and Note 20–Stockholders’ Equity in our notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on the Share Repurchase Program. Dividends We do not currently pay a dividend. Future dividends, if any, and the timing of declaration of any such dividends, will be at the discretion of the Board and will depend upon many factors, including, but not limited to, our results of operations, financial condition, level of indebtedness, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, restrictions in our debt agreements and in any preferred stock, business prospects and other factors that the Board deems relevant. See Note 20–Stockholders’ Equity to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details and the “– Covenant Compliance ” section which follows for further details on covenants that could restrict our ability to make certain restricted payments, including dividend payments and share repurchases. Other As of December 31, 2019, we have five interest rate swap agreements (“the Interest Rate Swap Agreements”) which effectively fix the interest rate on the LIBOR-indexed interest payments associated with $1.0 billion of SEA’s outstanding long-term debt. The Interest Rate Swap Agreements became effective on September 30, 2016; have a total notional amount of $1.0 billion; and mature on May 14, 2020. See Note 11–Long-Term Debt and Note 12–Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. 46 We believe that existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations, and available borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities will be adequate to meet the capital expenditures, debt service obligations, and working capital requirements of our operations for the foreseeable future. The following table presents a summary of our cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 348,416 $ 293,935 $ 192,457 Net cash used in investing activities (195,193 ) (180,029 ) (170,873 ) Net cash used in financing activities (147,305 ) (112,896 ) (56,965 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash $ 5,918 $ 1,010 $ (35,381 ) Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $348.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $293.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily impacted by improved operating performance. Net cash provided by operating activities was $293.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $192.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was largely related to an increase in revenue in 2018, resulting primarily from an increase in attendance. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Investing activities consist principally of capital investments we make in our theme parks for future attractions and infrastructure. Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of $195.2 million largely related to future attractions (see further breakdown of capital expenditures in the table below). We estimate that approximately $15.0 million of core capital expenditures in 2019 relates to a shift in timing due to accelerated ride opening schedules for 2020 and 2021 attractions. Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of $179.8 million largely related to attractions which opened in 2019. The increase in capital expenditures in 2019 is largely related to costs associated with our new corporate building as well as our new Sesame Place park expected to open in 2021. The following table presents detail of our capital expenditures for the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 Capital Expenditures: (Unaudited, in thousands) Core (a) $ 171,789 $ 177,204 Expansion/ROI projects (b) 23,428 2,566 Capital expenditures, total $ 195,217 $ 179,770 (a) Reflects capital expenditures for park rides, attractions and maintenance activities. (b) Reflects capital expenditures for park expansion, new properties, or other revenue and/or expense return on investment (“ROI”) projects. The amount of our capital expenditures may be affected by general economic and financial conditions, among other things, including restrictions imposed by our borrowing arrangements. We generally expect to fund our 2020 capital expenditures through our operating cash flow. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 results primarily from $150.0 million used to repurchase shares and repayments of $15.5 million on our long-term debt, partially offset by a net draw on our Revolving Credit Facility of $20.0 million. See Note 11–Long-Term Debt to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. Net cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to $98.0 million used for share repurchases, net repayments on long-term debt of $21.7 million and $8.1 million of debt issuance costs paid in connection with the Amended Credit Agreement to our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, as defined below, offset by a net draw of $15.0 million on our Revolving Credit Facility. See Note 11–Long-Term Debt to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. 47 Our Indebtedness We are a holding company and conduct our operations through our subsidiaries, which have incurred or guaranteed indebtedness as described below. Senior Secured Credit Facilities SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc. (“SEA”) is the borrower under our senior secured credit facilities (the “Senior Secured Credit Facilities”) pursuant to a credit agreement dated as of December 1, 2009, as the same may be amended, restated, supplemented or modified from time to time. On October 31, 2018, SEA entered into a refinancing amendment, (the “Amendment No. 9”) with SEA as the borrower, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, collateral agent, letter of credit issuer and swing line lender and the other agents and lenders from time to time (the “Amended Credit Agreement”), to the existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities. As of December 31, 2019, our Senior Secured Credit Facilities consisted of $1.508 billion in Term B-5 Loans which will mature on March 31, 2024, along with a $210.0 million Revolving Credit Facility, of which $50.0 million was drawn upon as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, SEA had approximately $20.4 million of outstanding letters of credit, leaving approximately $139.6 million available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility. Subsequent to December 31, 2019, SEA borrowed an additional $45.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility for general working capital purposes. See Note 11–Long-Term Debt to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. Covenant Compliance As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all covenants in the credit agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The Amended Credit Agreement removed all previous financial covenants on the Term B-5 Loans. The Revolving Credit Facility requires that SEA comply with a springing maximum first lien secured net leverage ratio of 6.25x to be tested as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, solely to the extent that on such date the aggregate amount of funded loans and letters of credit (excluding undrawn letters of credit in an amount not to exceed $30.0 million and cash collateralized letters of credit) under the Revolving Credit Facility exceeds an amount equal to 35% of the then outstanding commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility. Additionally, the definition of Adjusted EBITDA was amended to include the following items which had previously been added back on a limited basis: (i) add-backs of certain unusual items on a pre-tax basis which were previously added back on an after-tax basis only and (ii) unlimited add-backs primarily related to business optimization, development and strategic initiative costs which were previously limited to $15.0 million in any fiscal year. The Amended Credit Agreement also replaced the previous $10.0 million limitation on estimated cost savings with a limitation of 25% of the latest twelve months Adjusted EBITDA, calculated before estimated cost savings and increased the realization limit for estimated cost savings, operating expense reductions and synergies to 18 months. As of December 31, 2019, the total net leverage ratio as calculated under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 3.24 to 1.00. Our total net leverage ratio is calculated by dividing total net debt by the last twelve months Adjusted EBITDA plus $11.3 million in estimated cost savings which have been identified based on certain specified actions we have taken, including restructurings and cost savings initiatives. See Note 11–Long-Term Debt to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. Adjusted EBITDA We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate as it eliminates the effect of certain non-cash and other items not necessarily indicative of a company’s underlying operating performance. The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA provides additional information to investors about the calculation of, and compliance with, certain financial covenants and other relevant metrics in the credit agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Adjusted EBITDA is a material component of these covenants. We use Adjusted EBITDA in connection with certain components of our executive compensation program. In addition, investors, lenders, financial analysts and rating agencies have historically used EBITDA related measures in our industry, along with other measures, to estimate the value of a company, to make informed investment decisions and to evaluate companies in the industry. Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized term under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for a measure of our financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and is not indicative of income from operations as determined under GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP financial measures have limitations which should be considered before using these measures to evaluate our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA, as presented by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to varying methods of calculation. 48 The following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement, to net income (loss) for the periods indicated. The Adjusted EBITDA for all periods presented below reflects the current definitions in the Amended Credit Agreement. For the Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 (In thousands) Net income (loss) $ 89,476 $ 44,788 $ (202,386 ) Provision for (benefit from) income taxes 39,528 17,915 (85,006 ) Loss on early extinguishment of debt and write-off of discounts and debt issuance costs (a) — 8,150 8,143 Interest expense 84,178 80,914 78,001 Depreciation and amortization 160,557 160,955 163,294 Goodwill impairment charge (b) — — 269,332 Equity-based compensation expense (c) 11,106 22,152 23,203 Loss on impairment or disposal of assets and certain non-cash expenses (d) 3,198 18,862 12,431 Business optimization, development and strategic initiative costs (e) 27,869 29,460 17,473 Certain transaction and investment costs and other taxes (f) 5,056 3,353 1,082 Other adjusting items (g) 35,954 14,730 11,784 Adjusted EBITDA (h) 456,922 401,279 297,351 Items added back to Adjusted EBITDA, after cost savings, as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement: Estimated cost savings (i) 11,300 23,400 10,000 Adjusted EBITDA, after cost savings (j) $ 468,222 $ 424,679 $ 307,351 (a) Reflects a loss on early extinguishment of debt and write-off of discounts and debt issuance costs associated with 2018 and 2017 amendments to our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, respectively. See Note 11–Long-Term Debt to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. (b) Reflects a non-cash goodwill impairment charge recorded in the year ended December 31, 2017 related to the full impairment of goodwill for our SeaWorld Orlando reporting unit during the second quarter of 2017. See Note 9–Goodwill, Trade Names/Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets, Net, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. (c) Reflects non-cash compensation expenses associated with the grants of equity compensation. For the year ended December 31, 2018, includes approximately $5.5 million, related to equity awards which were accelerated in connection with the departure of certain executives, as required by their respective employment agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2017, includes $8.4 million associated with certain performance-vesting shares, a portion of which vested upon the closing of the ZHG Transaction on May 8, 2017. See Note 19–Equity-Based Compensation to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. (d) Reflects primarily non-cash expenses related to miscellaneous fixed asset disposals and impairments, including: (i) approximately $2.7 million associated with fixed asset disposals during the year ended December 31, 2019; (ii) approximately $10.9 million associated with certain rides and equipment which were removed from service during the year ended December 31, 2018; and (iii) a loss of approximately $7.8 million related to an amended agreement for the year ended December 31, 2017. See Note 8–Property and Equipment, Net, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. (e) For the year ended December 31, 2019, business optimization, development and other strategic initiative costs primarily related to: (i) $21.2 million of third party consulting costs and (ii) $4.2 million of severance and other employment costs. For the year ended December 31, 2018, business optimization, development and other strategic initiative costs primarily related to: (i) $17.4 million of severance and other employment costs which primarily includes costs associated with the departure of certain executives during 2018 and costs related to the 2018 Restructuring Program; (ii) $10.7 million of third party consulting costs; and (iii) $1.4 million of product and intellectual property development costs. 49 For the year ended December 31, 2017, business optimization, development and other strategic initiative costs primarily related to: (i) $5.2 million of severance and other employment costs associated with the 2017 Restructuring Program; (ii) $7.2 million of third party consulting and legal costs; (iii) $4.5 million of product and intellectual property development costs; and (iv) net costs of $0.6 million incurred for certain positions eliminated not related to a formal restructuring program or cost saving initiative. See Note 21–Severance and Other Separation Costs in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. Prior to the Amended Credit Agreement, due to limitations under the credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the amount which we were able to add back to Adjusted EBITDA for these costs, was limited to $15.0 million in any fiscal year. As such, the Adjusted EBITDA calculation for the year ended December 31, 2017 previously reported did not reflect approximately $2.5 million of related costs due to these limitations. (f) For the year ended December 31, 2019, includes approximately $4.3 million relating to expenses associated with the previously disclosed transfer of shares and HP Agreements. See Note 17–Related Party Transactions in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. For the year ended December 31, 2018, reflects primarily a loss of approximately $2.8 million relating to expenses incurred and fees associated with the termination of an agreement. (g) Reflects the impact of expenses, net of insurance recoveries and adjustments, incurred primarily related to certain legal matters, which we are permitted to exclude under the credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facilities due to the unusual nature of the items. For the year ended December 31, 2019, includes approximately $32.1 million related to a legal settlement charge, net of insurance recoveries. For the year ended December 31, 2018, includes $12.1 million related to legal settlements and $5.1 million in related legal fees which were partially offset by approximately $2.5 million of insurance recoveries received related to these legal matters. See Note 15–Commitments and Contingencies in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. Prior to the Amended Credit Agreement, these items were excluded on an after-tax basis only, as such, the Adjusted EBITDA calculation for the year ended December 31, 2017 previously reported did not reflect related taxes of approximately $4.0 million. (h) Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted to exclude certain non-cash, and other items permitted in calculating covenant compliance under the credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The Adjusted EBITDA presentation for the year ended December 31, 2017 has been changed to conform with the changes made to its definition in the Amended Credit Agreement. Prior to the Amended Credit Agreement, the credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facilities limited the amount of certain add-backs as described in footnotes (e) and (g) above. (i) The Senior Secured Credit Facilities permits the calculation of certain covenants to be based on Adjusted EBITDA, as defined above, for the last twelve month period further adjusted for net annualized estimated savings we expect to realize over the following 18 month period related to certain specified actions, including restructurings and cost savings initiatives. These estimated savings are calculated net of the amount of actual benefits realized during such period. These estimated savings are a non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA add-back item only as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement and does not impact our reported GAAP net income (loss). The Amended Credit Agreement limits the amount of such estimated savings which may be reflected to 25% of Adjusted EBITDA, calculated for the last twelve months before the impact of these estimated cost savings. Prior to the Amended Credit Agreement, the credit agreement limited the amount of such estimated savings which could be reflected in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA to $10.0 million for any four consecutive fiscal quarters calculated as the amount we expected to realize over the following twelve month period. (j) The Senior Secured Credit Facilities permits our calculation of certain covenants to be based on Adjusted EBITDA, as defined above, for the last twelve month period further adjusted for net annualized estimated savings as described in footnote (i) above. 50 Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019: Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years (In thousands) Long-term debt (including current portion) (a) $ 1,557,883 $ 65,505 $ 31,010 $ 1,461,368 $ — Interest on long-term debt (b) 321,759 79,488 149,445 92,826 — Operating and financing leases (c) 316,307 14,874 26,899 24,517 250,017 Purchase obligations, license commitments and other (d) 267,230 209,939 47,991 2,067 7,233 Total contractual obligations $ 2,463,179 $ 369,806 $ 255,345 $ 1,580,778 $ 257,250 (a) Represents principal payments on the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and Revolving Credit Facility. Our intent is to pay the $50.0 million outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility within the next twelve months, as such we have included this amount in the less than 1 year column. See Note 11–Long-Term Debt to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. (b) Includes amounts attributable to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, Revolving Credit Facility, and Interest Rate Swap Agreements calculated using interest rates at December 31, 2019. See Note 11–Long-Term Debt to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. (c) Represents commitments under long-term operating and financing leases requiring annual minimum lease payments, primarily consisting of the lease for the land of our SeaWorld theme park in San Diego, California. (d) We have minimum purchase commitments with various vendors through 2031. Outstanding minimum purchase commitments consist primarily of capital expenditures related to future attractions, infrastructure enhancements for existing facilities and information technology products and services. Amounts have been calculated using early termination fees or non-cancelable minimum contractual obligations by period, as applicable, under contracts that were in effect as of December 31, 2019. In addition, in connection with the Sesame License Agreement, we have made certain commitments including opening a new Sesame Place theme park which we announced we would open in the spring of 2021. As a result, obligations related to this agreement are included in the table above. The preceding table also includes $65.0 million related to a proposed legal settlement expected to be paid in 2020, but does not include related expected insurance proceeds. For further details, refer to Note 15–Commitments and Contingencies in our notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2019. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingencies during the reporting period. Significant estimates and assumptions include the valuation and useful lives of long-lived assets, the accounting for income taxes, the accounting for self-insurance and revenue recognition. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies which require management’s most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. For more discussion of these and other significant accounting policies, refer to Note 2–Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets All long-lived assets, including property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Assets are grouped and tested at the lowest level for which identifiable, independent cash flows are available. If significant, certain impairment indicators may trigger an impairment review. 51 An impairment loss may be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset, including disposition, are less than the carrying value of the asset. The measurement of the impairment loss to be recognized is based upon the difference between the fair value and the carrying amounts of the assets. Fair value is generally determined based upon a discounted cash flow analysis. In order to determine if an asset has been impaired, the determination of both undiscounted and discounted future cash flows requires management to make significant estimates and consider an anticipated course of action as of the balance sheet date. Subsequent changes in estimated undiscounted and discounted future cash flows arising from changes in anticipated actions could impact the determination of whether impairment exists. Accounting for Income Taxes We are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation periods for property and equipment and deferred revenue, for tax and financial accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets. We must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets (primarily net operating loss and charitable contribution carryforwards) will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent that we believe that recovery is not more likely than not, a valuation allowance against those amounts is recorded. To the extent that we record a valuation allowance or a change in the valuation allowance during a period, we recognize these amounts as income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) contains rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change, which is generally any change in ownership of more than 50% of its stock over a rolling three-year period, to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards in years after the ownership change. These rules generally operate by focusing on ownership shifts among stockholders owning directly or indirectly 5% or more of the stock of a company and any change in ownership arising from shares of stock sold by these same stockholders. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision or benefit for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets. Management has analyzed all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard in assessing the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred income tax assets. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of the statutory carryback and carryforward periods and tax planning alternatives. The assumptions about future taxable income require the use of significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying business. Due to the uncertainty of realizing the benefit from the deferred tax asset recorded for certain state net operating loss carryforwards, we have recorded a valuation allowance of $5.2 million and $2.8 million, net of federal tax benefit, on the deferred tax assets related to state net operating losses as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We believe it is more likely than not that the benefit from these state net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized. During the three months ended June 30, 2017, an ownership shift of more than 50 percent as defined by the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) Section 382 occurred. We determined that, while an ownership shift occurred and limits were determined under Section 382 and the regulations and guidance thereunder, the applicable limits would not impair the value or anticipated use of our federal and state net operating losses. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that any limitation under IRC Section 382 will not impair the realizability of the deferred income tax assets related to federal and state tax net operating loss carryforwards. Any future ownership change may, however, result in further limitations imposed by Section 382. Any such limitation may have the effect of reducing our after-tax cash flow in future years and may affect our need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets related to federal and state net operating loss carryforwards. Self-Insurance Reserves Reserves are recorded for the estimated amounts of guest and employee claims and expenses incurred each period that are not covered by insurance. Reserves are established for both identified claims and incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) claims. Such amounts are accrued for when claim amounts become probable and estimable. Reserves for identified claims are based upon our own historical claims experience and third-party estimates of settlement costs. Reserves for IBNR claims are based upon our own claims data history, as well as industry averages. All reserves are periodically reviewed for changes in facts and circumstances and adjustments are made as necessary. 52 Revenue Recognition Admissions revenue consists of single-day tickets, annual or season passes or other multi-day or multi-park admission products. Food, merchandise and other revenue primarily consists of culinary, merchandise and other in-park products and also includes other miscellaneous revenue which is not significant in the periods presented, including revenue related to our international agreements. For single-day tickets, we recognize revenue at a point in time, upon admission to the park, and for food, merchandise and other in-park products we recognize revenue when the related products or services are received by our guests. For annual or season passes and multi-use admission products, revenue is deferred and recognized over the terms of the admission product based on estimated redemption rates for similar products and is adjusted periodically. We estimate a redemption rate using historical and forecasted growth rates and attendance trends by park for similar products. Attendance trends factor in seasonality and are adjusted based on actual trends periodically. Revenue is recognized on a pro-rata basis based on the estimated allocated selling price of the admission product. For active pass products purchased under monthly installment arrangements that have extended beyond their initial commitment term, revenue is recognized monthly as payments are received. For multi-day admission products, revenue is allocated based on the number of visits included in the pass and recognized ratably based on each admission into the theme park. Certain admission products may also include bundled products at the time of purchase, such as culinary or merchandise items. We conduct an analysis of bundled products to identify separate distinct performance obligations that are material in the context of the contract. For those products that are determined to be distinct performance obligations and material in the context of the contract, we allocate a portion of the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation using each performance obligation’s standalone price. If the bundled product is related to a pass product and offered over time, revenue will be recognized over time accordingly. For further details, also refer to Note 4–Revenues, in our notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Inflation The impact of inflation has affected, and will continue to affect, our operations significantly. Our costs of food, merchandise and other revenues are influenced by inflation and fluctuations in global commodity prices. In addition, costs for construction, repairs and maintenance are all subject to inflationary pressures. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates, and to a lesser extent on currency exchange rates, from time to time, on imported rides and equipment. The objective of our financial risk management is to reduce the potential negative impact of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to acceptable levels. We do not acquire market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes. We manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed-rate long-term debt and interest rate swaps that fix a portion of our variable-rate long-term debt. The changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on our variable-rate debt. Through the expiration date of May 14, 2020, our estimate is that an additional $2.2 million will be reclassified as an increase to interest expense. After considering the impact of interest rate swap agreements, at December 31, 2019, approximately $1.0 billion of our outstanding long-term debt represents fixed-rate debt and approximately $507.9 million represents variable-rate debt. Assuming an average balance on our revolving credit borrowings of approximately $40.0 million, a hypothetical 100 bps increase in one month LIBOR on our variable-rate debt would lead to an increase of approximately $5.5 million in annual cash interest costs due to the impact of our fixed-rate interest swap agreements. Assuming we had no interest rate swap agreements in place, a hypothetical 100 bps increase in LIBOR would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $15.5 million. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto are provided in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. 53 Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), require public companies, including us, to maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” which are defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act to mean a company’s controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required or necessary disclosures. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. The design of any controls and procedures also is based on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation and subject to the foregoing, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to accomplish their objectives at a reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Regulations under the Exchange Act require public companies, including our Company, to evaluate any change in our “internal control over financial reporting” as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Effective on January 1, 2019, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 842, Leases, which resulted in recording lease liabilities and right-of-use assets on our consolidated balance sheet. As a result of this adoption, we implemented changes to our internal control activities and processes related to our lease commitments. These changes included implementing a new lease management software, establishing certain controls over financial reporting relating to leases and revising existing lease accounting policies and procedures. See Note 3–Recent Accounting Pronouncements and Note 14–Leases in our notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal year covered by this Annual Report that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting As required by the SEC’s rules and regulations for the implementation of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company, (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors, and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements in our consolidated financial statements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019. In making these assessments, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) . Based on our assessments and those criteria, management determined that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019. 54 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued a report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. This report appears on page F-4 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Item 9B. Other Information On February 25, 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a modification (the “Modification”) to certain outstanding performance-vesting restricted stock units granted to certain individuals, including, without limitation, Marc Swanson, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, G. Anthony (Tony) Taylor, the Company’s Chief Legal Officer, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, Walter Bogumil, the Company’s Chief Strategy Officer and Dr. Christopher (Chris) Dold, the Company’s Chief Zoological Officer (each an “NEO” and, collectively, the “NEOs”) in 2019 (the “2019 LTIP Performance Awards”), the terms of which were previously disclosed in the Company’s definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A relating to the Company’s 2019 annual meeting of stockholders. The Company approved the Modification to the 2019 LTIP Performance Awards in light of the subsequent performance-vesting restricted stock units award granted to the Company’s new Chief Executive Officer (the “CEO Performance Awards”) at the time of the commencement of his employment with the Company, in order better align the terms of the 2019 LTIP Performance Awards held by the NEOs with those of the CEO Performance Awards. The CEO Performance Awards have a three-year performance period consisting of the 2020-2022 calendar years (or, extended through the end of the 2023 calendar year, as applicable); however, the 2019 LTIP Performance Awards contained a three-year performance period consisting of the 2019-2021 calendar years (or, extended through the end of the 2022 calendar year, as applicable). Upon review of the awards the Compensation Committee of the Board determined it was preferable to align the 2019 LTIP Performance Awards with the CEO Performance Awards and put everyone on the same remaining performance cycle with aligned performance metrics. Pursuant to the Modification, the threshold and target performance goals were revised to align with the CEO Performance Awards threshold and target performance goals and the performance period was extended through calendar year 2022 (or, the end of the 2023 calendar year, as applicable) consistent with the CEO Performance Awards. There was no incremental equity compensation expense under Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718 (“ASC Topic 718”) associated with the modification of the NEOs’ awards on the date of modification. The Company will use the respective modification date fair value to record equity compensation expense related to these awards when and if they become probable of vesting in a future period, in accordance with ASC Topic 718. Rule 10b5-1 Plans Our policy governing transactions in our securities by our directors, officers and employees permits such persons to adopt stock trading plans pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our directors, officers and employees have in the past and may from time to time establish such stock trading plans. We do not undertake any obligation to disclose, or to update or revise any disclosure regarding, any such plans and specifically do not undertake to disclose the adoption, amendment, termination or expiration of any such plans.

Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 26, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, effective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Topic Accounting Standards Codification 842 —Leases , using the modified retrospective approach. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Revenue Recognition—Deferred Revenue Related to Annual and Season Admission Pass Products—Refer to Note 2 and Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company’s annual and season passes allow guests access to specific parks over a specified time period. Such revenue is deferred and recognized over the terms of the admission product based on estimated redemption rates for similar products and is adjusted periodically. The Company estimates a redemption rate using historical and forecasted growth rates and attendance trends by park for similar products. Attendance trends factor in seasonality and are adjusted based on actual trends periodically. Revenue is recognized on a pro rata basis based on the estimated allocated selling price of the admission product. The Company tracks and recognizes deferred revenue utilizing internally developed models. Auditing the attendance projections by park, which is the primary input used in the deferred revenue models, and the redemption rates calculated through the models, required extensive audit effort due to the complexity and manual nature of the models. F-2 How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the attendance projections by park and the recognition of revenue from the deferred revenue related to annual and season admission pass products included the following, among others: • We tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over revenue recognition related to annual and season admission pass products, including controls over actual and forecasted attendance used in the models. • We evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast expected attendance by comparing actual results to management’s historical forecasts. • We evaluated the reasonableness of the current-year attendance forecasts compared to prior-year actual results, considering recent trends in the Company’s attendance. • We tested the mathematical accuracy and appropriateness of management’s deferred revenue models and timing of recognition. • We developed an independent expectation of the deferred revenue balances, related to annual and season admission pass products, comparing such expectation to the recorded amount. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Tampa, Florida February 26, 2020 We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2009. F-3 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 of the Company and our report dated February 26, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and included an explanatory paragraph regarding the Company’s adoption of a new accounting standard. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Tampa, Florida February 26, 2020 F-4 SEAWORLD ENTERTAINMENT, INC.

F-8 SEAWORLD ENTERTAINMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc., through its wholly-owned subsidiary, SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc. (“SEA”) (collectively, the “Company”), owns and operates twelve theme parks within the United States. Prior to December 1, 2009, the Company did not have any operations. On December 1, 2009, the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity interest of Busch Entertainment LLC and affiliates from Anheuser Busch Companies, Inc. and Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (“ABI”). At that time, the Company was owned by ten limited partnerships, ultimately controlled by affiliates of The Blackstone Group L.P. (“Blackstone”) and certain co-investors. The Company completed an initial public offering in April 2013. See further discussion relating to subsequent ownership changes in Note 17–Related-Party Transactions. The Company operates SeaWorld theme parks in Orlando, Florida; San Antonio, Texas; and San Diego, California, and Busch Gardens theme parks in Tampa, Florida, and Williamsburg, Virginia. The Company operates water attraction theme parks in Orlando, Florida (Aquatica); San Antonio, Texas (Aquatica); Chula Vista, California, (Aquatica); Tampa, Florida (Adventure Island); and Williamsburg, Virginia (Water Country USA). The Company also operates a reservations-only theme park in Orlando, Florida (Discovery Cove) and a seasonal theme park in Langhorne, Pennsylvania (Sesame Place). During each of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 approximately 57 % of the Company’s revenues were generated in the State of Florida. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including SEA. All intercompany accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, the accounting for self-insurance, deferred tax assets and liabilities, deferred revenue, equity compensation and the valuation of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash held at financial institutions as well as operating cash onsite at each theme park to fund daily operations and amounts due from third-party credit card companies with settlement terms of less than four days . The amounts due from third-party credit card companies totaled $ 9.7 million and $ 17.4 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The cash balances in all accounts held at financial institutions are insured up to $ 250,000 by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) through December 31, 2019. At times, cash balances may exceed federally insured amounts and potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk. Management believes that no significant concentration of credit risk exists with respect to these cash balances because of its assessment of the creditworthiness and financial viability of the respective financial institutions. From time to time, the Company may invest in certain highly liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less. These instruments may include money market mutual funds, certificates of deposit or time deposits, among others, which may or may not qualify for FDIC insurance. The Company classifies any such instruments as cash and cash equivalents based on their short-term maturities. F-9 Restricted Cash Restricted cash is recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Restricted cash consists primarily of funds received from strategic partners for use in approved marketing and promotional activities. December 31, December 31, 2019 2018 (In thousands) Cash and cash equivalents $ 39,946 $ 34,073 Restricted cash, included in prepaid expenses and other current assets 979 934 Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 40,925 $ 35,007 Accounts Receivable—Net Accounts receivable are reported at net realizable value and consist primarily of amounts due from customers for the sale of admission products, including amounts due for admissions products purchased on monthly installment arrangements. The Company is not exposed to a significant concentration of credit risk. The Company records an allowance on trade accounts receivable with an offset to the provision for bad debt for estimated uncollectible receivables, based on the amount and status of past-due accounts, contractual terms of the receivables and the Company’s history of uncollectible accounts. For all periods presented, the provision for bad debt was immaterial related to these accounts. The Company also records an allowance on amounts due from monthly installment arrangements based on historical default rates. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded $ 12.1 million and $ 14.7 million, respectively, as an allowance on its installment arrangements with a corresponding reduction to deferred revenue. Inventories Inventories are accounted for using the weighted average cost method and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventories consist primarily of products for resale, including merchandise, culinary items and miscellaneous supplies. Obsolete or excess inventories are recorded at their estimated realizable value. Property and Equipment—Net Property and equipment are recorded at cost. The cost of ordinary or routine maintenance, repairs, spare parts and minor renewals is expensed as incurred. Development costs associated with new attractions and products are generally capitalized after necessary feasibility studies have been completed and final concept or contracts have been approved. The cost of assets is depreciated using the straight-line method based on the following estimated useful lives: Land improvements 10 - 40 years Buildings 5 - 40 years Rides, attractions and equipment 3 - 20 years Animals 1 - 50 years Certain costs related to animals exhibited in the theme parks are capitalized and amortized over their estimated lives ( 1 - 50 years ). All costs to maintain animals are expensed as incurred, including in-house animal breeding costs, as they are immaterial to the consolidated financial statements. Construction in progress assets consist primarily of new rides, attractions and infrastructure improvements that have not yet been placed in service. These assets are stated at cost and are not depreciated. Once construction of the assets is completed and placed into service, assets are reclassified to the appropriate asset class based on their nature and depreciated in accordance with the useful lives above. Debt interest is capitalized on all active construction projects. Total interest capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $ 4.6 million, $ 4.2 million and $ 2.7 million, respectively. Computer System Development Costs The Company capitalizes computer system development costs that meet established criteria and, once placed in service, amortizes those costs to expense on a straight-line basis over five years . Total capitalized costs related to computer system development costs, net of accumulated amortization, were $ 4.2 million and $ 6.1 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and are recorded in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Accumulated amortization was $ 9.5 million and $ 9.9 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Amortization expense of capitalized computer system development costs during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $ 2.2 million, $ 3.7 million and $ 3.5 million, respectively, and is recorded in depreciation and amortization in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Systems reengineering costs do not meet the proper criteria for capitalization and are expensed as incurred. F-10 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets All long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. An impairment loss may be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset, including disposition, are less than the carrying value of the asset. The measurement of the impairment loss to be recognized is based upon the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying amounts of the assets. Fair value is generally determined based upon a discounted cash flow analysis. In order to determine if an asset has been impaired, assets are grouped and tested at the lowest level for which identifiable independent cash flows are available (generally a theme park). See further discussion in Note 8–Property and Equipment, Net. Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but instead reviewed for impairment at least annually on December 1, and as of an interim date should factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim test, with ongoing recoverability based on applicable reporting unit overall financial performance and consideration of significant events or changes in the overall business environment or macroeconomic conditions. Such events or changes in the overall business environment could include, but are not limited to, significant negative trends or unanticipated changes in the competitive or macroeconomic environment. In assessing goodwill for impairment, the Company may choose to initially evaluate qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The Company considers several factors, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance of the reporting unit, changes in management, strategy or customers, and relevant reporting unit specific events such as a change in the carrying amount of net assets, a more likely than not expectation of selling or disposing all, or a portion, of a reporting unit, and the testing of recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment is not conclusive, then a quantitative impairment analysis for goodwill is performed at the reporting unit level. The Company may also choose to perform this quantitative impairment analysis instead of the qualitative analysis. The quantitative impairment analysis compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, determined using the income and/or market approach, to its recorded amount. If the recorded amount exceeds the fair value, then a goodwill impairment charge is recorded for the difference up to the recorded amount of goodwill. The determination of fair value in the Company’s goodwill impairment analysis is based on an estimate of fair value for the relevant reporting unit utilizing known and estimated inputs at the evaluation date. Some of those inputs include, but are not limited to, estimates of future revenue and expense growth, estimated market multiples, expected capital expenditures, income tax rates and cost of invested cap ital. The Company’s other indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of certain trade names/trademarks and other intangible assets which, after considering legal, regulatory, contractual, and other competitive and economic factors, are determined to have indefinite lives and are valued using the relief from royalty method. Trade names/trademarks are combined by brand as a unit of accounting when testing for impairment as the brand represents the highest and best use of the asset and drives the Company’s marketing strategy and international license agreements. Estimates required in this valuation method include estimated future revenues impacted by the trade names/trademarks, royalty rates, and appropriate discount rates. Projections are based on management’s best estimates given recent financial performance, market trends, strategic plans, brand awareness, operating characteristics by park, and other available information. See Note 9–Goodwill, Trade Names/Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets, Net, for further details. Self-Insurance Reserves Reserves are recorded for the estimated amounts of guest and employee claims and expenses incurred each period that are not covered by insurance. Reserves are established for both identified claims and incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) claims. Such amounts are accrued for when claim amounts become probable and estimable. Reserves for identified claims are based upon the Company’s historical claims experience and third-party estimates of settlement costs. Reserves for IBNR claims are based upon the Company’s claims data history, actuarially determined loss development factors and qualitative considerations such as claims management activities. The Company maintains self-insurance reserves for healthcare, auto, general liability and workers’ compensation claims. Total claims reserves were $ 31.7 million at December 31, 2019, of which $ 2.8 million is recorded in accrued salaries, wages and benefits, $ 7.5 million is recorded in other accrued liabilities and the remaining long-term portion is recorded in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Total claims reserves were $ 31.2 million at December 31, 2018, of which $ 3.8 million is recorded in accrued salaries, wages and benefits, $ 6.9 million is recorded in other accrued liabilities and the remaining long-term portion is recorded in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. All reserves are periodically reviewed for changes in facts and circumstances and adjustments are made as necessary. Debt Issuance Costs Debt issuance costs are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the related debt and are included in long-term debt, net, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. See further discussion in Note 11–Long-Term Debt. F-11 Share Repurchase Program and Treasury Stock From time to time, the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) may authorize share repurchases of common stock. Shares repurchased under Board authorizations are held in treasury for general corporate purposes. The Company accounts for treasury stock on the trade date under the cost method. Treasury stock at December 31, 2019 and 2018 is recorded as a reduction to stockholders’ equity as the Company does not currently intend to retire the treasury stock held. See further discussion of the Company’s share repurchase program in Note 20–Stockholders’ Equity. Revenue Recognition The Company has adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”), Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements within the scope of ASC 606, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contracts with customers; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies the performance obligations. ASC 606 also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts. Admissions Revenue Admissions revenue primarily consists of single-day tickets, annual or season passes or other multi-day or multi-park admission products. As allowed by the practical expedient available to public companies under ASC 606, which the Company adopted, admission products with similar characteristics are analyzed using a portfolio approach for each separate park as the Company expects that the effects on the consolidated financial statements of applying this guidance to the portfolio does not differ materially from applying the guidance to individual contracts within the portfolio. For single-day tickets, the Company recognizes revenue at a point in time, upon admission to the park. Annual passes, season passes or other multi-day or multi-park passes allow guests access to specific parks over a specified time period. For these pass and multi-use products, revenue is deferred and recognized over the terms of the admission product based on estimated redemption rates for similar products and is adjusted periodically. The Company estimates a redemption rate using historical and forecasted growth rates and attendance trends by park for similar products. Attendance trends factor in seasonality and are adjusted based on actual trends periodically. Revenue is recognized on a pro-rata basis based on the estimated allocated selling price of the admission product. For active pass products purchased under monthly installment arrangements that have extended beyond their initial commitment term, revenue is recognized monthly as payments are received. For multi-day admission products, revenue is allocated based on the number of visits included in the pass and recognized ratably based on each admission into the theme park. The Company has also entered into agreements with certain external theme park, zoo and other attraction operators to jointly market and sell single and multi-use admission products. These joint products allow admission to both a Company park(s) and an external park, zoo or other attraction. The agreements with the external partners specify the allocation of revenue to Company parks from any jointly sold products. Whether the Company or the external partner sells the product, the Company’s portion of revenue is deferred until the first time the product is redeemed at one of the Company’s parks and recognized over its related use in a manner consistent with the Company’s other admission products. Additionally, the Company barters theme park admission products and sponsorship opportunities for advertising, employee recognition awards, and various other services. The fair value of the products or services is recognized into admissions revenue and related expenses at the time of the exchange and approximates the estimated fair value of the goods or services provided or received, whichever is more readily determinable. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, amounts included within admissions revenue with an offset to either selling, general and administrative expenses or operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) related to bartered ticket transactions were $ 16.2 million, $ 16.6 million and $ 20.8 million, respectively. In accordance with the practical expedients available to public companies under ASC 606 which the accounting standards provide to simplify compliance, the Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which the Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it has the right to invoice for services performed. Additionally, the Company generally expenses sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). The Company has also elected not to adjust consideration for the effects of financing components in the form of installment purchase plans as the period between when the Company transfers the promised service to the customer and when the customer pays for that service generally does not exceed one year. F-12 Food, Merchandise and Other Revenue Food, merchandise and other revenue primarily consists of culinary, merchandise, parking and other in-park products and also includes other miscellaneous revenue which is not significant in the periods presented, including revenue related to the Company’s international agreements as discussed in Note 4–Revenues. The Company recognizes revenue for food, merchandise and other in-park products when the related products or services are received by the guests. Certain admission products may also include bundled products at the time of purchase, such as culinary or merchandise items. The Company conducts an analysis of bundled products to identify separate distinct performance obligations that are material in the context of the contract. For those products that are determined to be distinct performance obligations and material in the context of the contract, the Company allocates a portion of the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation using each performance obligation’s standalone price. If the bundled product is related to a pass product and offered over time, revenue will be recognized over time accordingly. See further discussion in Note 4–Revenues. Advertising and Promotional Costs Advertising production costs are deferred and expensed the first time the advertisement is shown. Other advertising and media costs are expensed as incurred and for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, totaled approximately $ 138.3 million, $ 127.5 million and $ 118.0 million, respectively, and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Equity-Based Compensation In accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation , the Company measures the cost of employee services rendered in exchange for equity-based compensation based upon the grant date fair market value. The cost is recognized over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period unless service or performance conditions require otherwise. The Company recognizes the impact of forfeitures as they occur. The Company grants time-vesting restricted shares and units, time-vesting deferred stock units, performance-vesting restricted shares and units, and stock options. The Company uses the closing stock price on the date of grant to value its time-vesting restricted share awards and its performance-vesting restricted share awards. The Company uses the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model to value stock options at the date of grant. On occasion, the Company may modify the terms or conditions of an equity award for its employees. If an award is modified, the Company evaluates the type of modification in accordance with ASC 718 to determine the appropriate accounting. See further discussion in Note 19–Equity-Based Compensation. Restructuring Costs The Company accounts for exit or disposal of activities in accordance with ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations if the one-time benefit arrangements are not part of an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract. Nonretirement postemployment benefits that are part of an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract are accounted for in accordance with ASC 712, Compensation-Nonretirement Postemployment Benefits . The Company defines a business restructuring as an exit or disposal activity that includes but is not limited to a program which is planned and controlled by management and materially changes either the scope of a business or the manner in which that business is conducted. Business restructuring charges may include (i) one-time termination benefits related to employee separations, (ii) contract termination costs and (iii) other related costs associated with exit or disposal activities. If the one-time benefit arrangements are not part of an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract, a liability is recognized and measured at its fair value for one-time termination benefits once the plan of termination is communicated to affected employees and it meets all of the following criteria: (i) management commits to a plan of termination, (ii) the plan identifies the number of employees to be terminated and their job classifications or functions, locations and the expected completion date, (iii) the plan establishes the terms of the benefit arrangement and (iv) it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or the plan will be withdrawn. If the one-time benefit arrangements are part of an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract, a liability is recognized and measured at its fair value for one-time termination benefits when the following conditions are met: (i) the obligation is attributable to services already rendered; (ii) rights to those benefits accumulate; (iii) payment of the benefits is probable; and (iv) amount can be reasonably estimated. If these four conditions are not met, a liability is recognized when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated in accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies . Contract termination costs include costs to terminate a contract or costs that will continue to be incurred under the contract without benefit to the Company. A liability is recognized and measured at its fair value when the Company either terminates the contract or ceases using the rights conveyed by the contract. See further discussion in Note 21–Severance and Other Separation Costs. F-13 Leases The Company adopted ASC 842, Leases , as of January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective approach and elected the Comparatives Under 840 Option” allowing the Company to not recast comparative periods in the period of adoption but present those periods under historical requirements of ASC 840. Under the provisions of ASC 842, right of use assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. Lease terms may include options to renew when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the operating lease. The present value of future minimum lease payments is calculated using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Company’s incremental borrowing rate, which reflects the rate of interest it would pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments under similar terms. As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses incremental borrowing rates based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of the lease payments. In calculating the incremental borrowing rates, the Company considered recent ratings from credit agencies, recent trading prices on the Company’s debt, and current lease demographic information. The Company used the incremental borrowing rates on December 31, 2018 for newly recognized operating leases that commenced prior to that date. The Company applies the incremental borrowing rates at a portfolio level based on lease terms. The Company has elected not to recognize on the balance sheet leases with an initial and expected term of 12 months or less, instead lease expense is recognized for these short-term leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For lease agreements entered into or reassessed upon adoption of ASC 842, the Company has elected to combine lease and non-lease components for each class of underlying asset based on a practical expedient permitted under ASC 842. Some of the Company’s leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from one to 10 years or more. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Company’s sole discretion. Certain leases also include options to purchase the leased property. The depreciable life of assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term, unless there is a transfer of title or a purchase option reasonably certain of exercise. Certain of the Company’s lease agreements include rental payments based on a percentage of sales over contractual levels and others include rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation. These variable lease payments are typically recognized when the underlying event occurs and are included in operating expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) in the same line item as the expense arising from fixed lease payments. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees, material restrictive covenants or material variable lease costs other than those described in Note 14–Leases related to the Company’s land lease. All long-lived assets, including right of use assets associated with leases, are reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. The measurement of an impairment loss to be recognized is based upon the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying amounts of the assets. Fair value is generally determined based upon a discounted cash flow analysis. See further discussion in Note 14–Leases. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Realization is dependent on generating sufficient future taxable income or the reversal of deferred tax liabilities during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. The Company evaluates its tax positions by determining if it is more likely than not a tax position is sustainable upon examination, based upon the technical merits of the position, before any of the benefit is recorded for financial statement purposes. The benefit is measured as the largest dollar amount of the position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon settlement. Previously recorded benefits that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are charged to earnings in the period that the determination is made. Interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits are charged to the provision for (benefit from) income taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). See further discussion in Note 13–Income Taxes. F-14 Contingencies The Company accounts for contingencies in accordance with ASC 450, Contingencies . For loss contingencies, such as potential legal settlements, the Company records an estimated loss when payment is considered probable and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company, the Company evaluates the perceived merits of the legal proceedings as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein. If a loss is considered probable but the best estimate of the loss can only be identified within a range and no specific amount within that range is more likely, then the minimum of the range is accrued. Legal and related professional services costs to defend litigation are expensed as incurred. Insurance recoveries related to potential claims are recognized up to the amount of the recorded liability when coverage is confirmed and the estimated recoveries are probable of payment. These recoveries are not netted against the related liabilities for financial statement presentation. Additionally, for any potential gain contingencies, the Company does not recognize the gain until the period that all contingencies have been resolved and the amounts are realizable. See further discussion in Note 15–Commitments and Contingencies. Fair Value Measurements Fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement and is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. An entity is permitted to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each period. The Company has not elected to use the fair value option for any of its financial assets and financial liabilities that are not already recorded at fair value. Carrying values of financial instruments classified as current assets and current liabilities approximate fair value, due to their short-term nature. Fair Value Hierarchy —As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, fair value accounting standards establish a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity. Fair value is determined for assets and liabilities, based upon significant levels of observable or unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s market assumptions. This hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. These two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy: Level 1 —Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Level 2 —Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets. Level 3 —Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. Determination of Fair Value —If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed valuation techniques that use, where possible, current market-based or independently sourced market parameters, such as interest and currency rates. Assets or liabilities valued using such internally generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation. Thus, an item may be classified in Level 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that are readily observable. See further discussion in Note 16–Fair Value Measurements. Segment Reporting The Company maintains discrete financial information for each of its twelve theme parks, which is used by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”), identified as the Chief Executive Officer, as a basis for allocating resources. Each theme park has been identified as an operating segment and meets the criteria for aggregation due to similar economic characteristics. In addition, all of the theme parks provide similar products and services and share similar processes for delivering services. The theme parks have a high degree of similarity in the workforces and target similar consumer groups. Accordingly, based on these economic and operational similarities and the way the CODM monitors and makes decisions affecting the operations, the Company has concluded that its operating segments may be aggregated and that it has one reportable segment. F-15 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging , provides the disclosure requirements for derivatives and hedging activities with the intent to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of: (i) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (ii) how the entity accounts for derivative instruments and related hedged items, and (iii) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Further, qualitative disclosures are required that explain the Company’s objectives and strategies for using derivatives, as well as quantitative disclosures about the fair value of, and gains and losses on, derivative instruments, and disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative instruments. During 2018, the Company has adopted ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities , which aims to improve reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements and simplify the application of the hedge accounting guidance. See further discussion in Note 3 – Recent Accounting Pronouncements. As required by ASC 815, the Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value as either assets or liabilities. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. For derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk, the changes in fair value of the derivative contract are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, and subsequently reclassified into interest expense in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge. The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of its risk, even though hedge accounting does not apply or the Company elects not to apply hedge accounting. See further discussion in Note 12–Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. 3. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS The Company reviews new accounting pronouncements as they are issued or proposed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). Recently Implemented Accounting Standards On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 842, Leases . The new standard is intended to provide enhanced transparency and comparability by requiring lessees to record right of use assets and corresponding lease liabilities on the balance sheet. The new guidance requires the Company to continue to classify leases as either operating or financing, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The Company is also required to disclose qualitative and quantitative information about leasing arrangements to enable financial statement users to assess the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The Company adopted ASC 842 using a modified retrospective method that did not require the prior period information to be restated. ASC 842 also provides a number of optional provisions, known as practical expedients, which companies may elect to adopt to facilitate implementation. The Company elected a package of practical expedients which, among other items, precludes the Company from needing to reassess 1) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, 2) the lease classification of any expired or existing leases, and 3) initial direct costs for any existing leases. The Company elected not to implement the practical expedient related to hindsight to determine lease terms. Due to the implementation of selected practical expedients, there was no cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings. See Note 14–Leases for additional disclosures. On January 1, 2019, the Company also adopted the following Accounting Standards Updates (“ASUs”) which had no material impact on its consolidated financial statements or disclosures: • ASU 2018-09, Codification Improvements, clarifies, corrects and makes minor improvements to a wide variety of topics in the ASC. The amendments make the ASC easier to understand and apply by eliminating inconsistencies and providing clarifications. • ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) , eliminates certain disclosures related to the amount of and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The ASU also adds new disclosure requirements for Level 3 measurements. F-16 • ASU 2018 - 15 , Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That is a Service Contract, generally aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The ASU also adds certain disclosure requirements related to implementation costs incurred for internal-use software and cloud computing arrangements. • ASU 2018-16, Derivatives and Hedging—Inclusion of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Overnight Index Swap (OIS) Rate as a Benchmark Interest Rate for Hedge Accounting Purposes , expands the list of United States benchmark interest rates permitted in the application of hedge accounting. The amendments in this ASU allow use of the Overnight Index Swap (OIS) rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as a U.S. benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes under Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging . During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company also adopted the following ASUs: • ASU 2018-02, Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, gives companies the option to reclassify to retained earnings any tax effects related to items in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss that are stranded due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). Companies are required to disclose whether or not they elected to reclassify the tax effects related to the Tax Act as well as their policy for releasing income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. The Company elected to early adopt the ASU on January 1, 2018 and applied the amendments in the period of adoption. As a result, the Company reclassified $ 1.1 million of “stranded” tax effects of the Tax Act from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to accumulated deficit in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the accompanying consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ equity. See Note 12 – Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities for additional disclosure . • ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition . Under this ASU and subsequently issued amendments, revenue is recognized at the time a good or service is transferred to a customer for the amount of consideration expected to be received. The Company adopted this standard and subsequently issued amendments on January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective transition method. The adoption of ASU 2014-09 and its subsequently issued amendments did not have a material impact on the Company’s existing or new contracts as of January 1, 2018; therefore, no cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings was required as a result of adoption. See Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies subtopic “ Revenue Recognition ” and Note 4 – Revenues for additional disclosure. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company also adopted the following ASUs which had no material impact on its consolidated financial statements or disclosures: • ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities, aims to improve reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements and simplify the application of the hedge accounting guidance. See Note 12 – Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities for additional disclosure. • ASU 2017-09, Compensation–Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting, provides clarity and reduces diversity in practice regarding the application of guidance on the modification of equity awards. • ASU 2016-18, Restricted Cash–a Consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force, requires companies to include restricted cash balances with cash and cash equivalent balances in the statement of cash flows. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2018 using the retrospective transition method. • ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, simplifies the income tax accounting of intra-entity transfers of an asset other than inventory by requiring an entity to recognize the income tax effect when the transfer occurs. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2018 using a modified retrospective transition method. • ASU 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, provides guidance on the presentation and classification of eight specific cash flow issues that previously resulted in diversity in practice. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2018 using a retrospective transition method for each period presented. F-17 4. REVENUES Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , using the modified retrospective transition method. The adoption of ASC 606 did not have a material impact on the Company’s existing or new contracts as of January 1, 2018; therefore, no cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings was required as a result of adoption. The Company recognizes revenue upon admission into a park for single day tickets and when products are received by customers for merchandise, culinary or other in-park spending. For annual or season passes and other multi-use admission products, deferred revenue is recorded and the related revenue is recognized over the terms of the admission product and its estimated redemption rates, which is adjusted periodically. Total revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) are recorded net of sales-related taxes collected from guests and remitted or payable to government taxing authorities. See further discussion in Note 2–Summary of Significant Accounting Policies- Revenue Recognition . Deferred revenue primarily includes revenue associated with pass products and contract liability balances related to licensing and international agreements collected in advance of the Company satisfying its performance obligations and is expected to be recognized in future periods. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, $ 10.0 million and $ 10.1 million, respectively, is included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets related to the long-term portion of deferred revenue, which primarily relates to the Company’s international agreement, as discussed in the following section. The Company expects to recognize this revenue over the term of the respective license agreement beginning when substantially all of the services have been performed, which is expected to be upon opening. The following table reflects the Company’s deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2019 and 2018: 2019 2018 (In thousands) Deferred revenue, including long-term portion $ 114,416 $ 111,181 Less: Deferred revenue, long-term portion, included in other liabilities 10,000 10,071 Deferred revenue, short-term portion $ 104,416 $ 101,110 All of the $ 101.1 million of deferred revenue, short term portion, balance outstanding as of January 1, 2019 was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2019. The change in deferred revenue as of December 31, 2019 compared to the prior period primarily relates to additional pass product sales during the year ended December 31, 2019, offset by revenue recognized during 2019. International Agreements The Company has received $ 10.0 million in deferred revenue recorded in other liabilities related to a nonrefundable payment received from a partner in connection with a project in the Middle East (the “Middle East Project”) to provide certain services pertaining to the planning and design of the Middle East Project, with funding received expected to offset internal expenses. Approximately $ 5.0 million and $ 3.8 million of costs incurred related to the Middle East Project are recorded in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company has recognized an asset for the costs incurred to fulfill the contract as the costs are specifically identifiable, enhance resources that will be used to satisfy performance obligations in the future and are expected to be recovered. The related deferred revenue and expense will begin to be recognized when substantially all of the services have been performed, which is expected to be upon opening of the park. The Company continually monitors performance on the contract and will make adjustments, if necessary. The Middle East Project is subject to various conditions, including, but not limited to, the parties completing the design development and there is no assurance that the Middle East Project will be completed or advance to the next stages. In March 2017, the Company entered into a Park Exclusivity and Concept Design Agreement and a Center Concept and Preliminary Design Support Agreement (collectively, the “ZHG Agreements”) with an affiliate of Zhonghong Zhuoye Group Co., Ltd. (“ZHG Group”), to provide design, support and advisory services for various potential projects and grant exclusive rights in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau. In April 2019, the Company terminated the ZHG Agreements for non-payment of undisputed amounts owed. As of December 31, 2018, approximately $ 2.4 million was recorded in deferred revenue related to the ZHG Agreements in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 , the Company recorded revenue related to the ZHG Agreements of approximately $ 1.7 million, $ 5.1 million and $ 3.9 million, respectively, which is included in food, merchandise and other revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). See Note 17–Related-Party Transactions for further details. F-18 5. EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE Earnings (loss) per share is computed as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Net Income Shares Per Share Amount Net Income Shares Per Share Amount Net Loss Shares Per Share Amount (In thousands, except per share amounts) Basic earnings (loss) per share $ 89,476 80,309 $ 1.11 $ 44,788 86,170 $ 0.52 $ ( 202,386 ) 85,811 $ ( 2.36 ) Effect of dilutive incentive-based awards 735 740 — Diluted earnings (loss) per share $ 89,476 81,044 $ 1.10 $ 44,788 86,910 $ 0.52 $ ( 202,386 ) 85,811 $ ( 2.36 ) In accordance with the Earnings Per Share Topic of the ASC, basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period (excluding treasury stock and unvested restricted stock awards). Unvested restricted stock awards are eligible to receive dividends, if any; however, dividend rights will be forfeited if the award does not vest. Accordingly, only vested shares of formerly restricted stock are included in the calculation of basic earnings per share. The weighted average number of repurchased shares during the period, if any, which are held as treasury stock, are excluded from shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is determined using the treasury stock method based on the dilutive effect of certain unvested restricted stock awards and certain shares of common stock that are issuable upon exercise of stock options. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were approximately 305,000 and 1,299,000 anti-dilutive shares of common stock excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2017, there were approximately 5,090,000 potentially dilutive shares of common stock excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share as their effect would have been anti-dilutive due to the Company’s net loss in the period. The Company’s outstanding performance-vesting restricted stock awards are considered contingently issuable shares and are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share until the performance measure criteria is met as of the end of the reporting period. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, approximately 247,000 , 364,000 , and 78,000 performance-vesting restricted stock awards had met their performance criteria as of the end of the reporting periods, respectively, and are therefore included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share. See further discussion in Note 19–Equity-Based Compensation. 6. INVENTORIES Inventories as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 consisted of the following: 2019 2018 (In thousands) Merchandise $ 28,515 $ 31,232 Food and beverage 4,430 4,365 Other supplies 218 217 Total inventories $ 33,163 $ 35,814 7. PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS Prepaid expenses and other current assets as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 consisted of the following: 2019 2018 (In thousands) Prepaid insurance $ 2,397 $ 5,857 Prepaid marketing and advertising costs 2,264 3,821 Insurance recoveries 32,911 — Other 8,740 9,022 Total prepaid expenses and other current assets $ 46,312 $ 18,700 F-19 As of December 31, 2019, insurance recoveries above relates to insurance proceeds expected to be received from the Company’s insurance carriers related to a legal settlement. See further details in Note 10–Other Accrued Liabilities and Note 15–Commitments and Contingencies. 8. PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, NET The components of property and equipment, net as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, consisted of the following: 2019 2018 (In thousands) Land $ 286,200 $ 286,200 Land improvements 403,409 378,261 Buildings 733,258 690,921 Rides, attractions and equipment 1,527,301 1,476,866 Animals 142,232 142,081 Construction in progress 117,121 82,709 Less accumulated depreciation ( 1,476,059 ) ( 1,365,006 ) Total property and equipment, net $ 1,733,462 $ 1,692,032 Depreciation expense was approximately $ 156.2 million, $ 155.0 million, and $ 155.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded approximately $ 2.7 million in fixed asset write-offs, which is included in operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss). For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded approximately $ 10.9 million in fixed asset disposals associated with certain rides and equipment which were removed from service during 2018, which is included in operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss). During 2017, the Company amended an existing agreement relating to the use of certain animals, which reduced the expected future cash flows related to the agreement. As a result, the Company recognized an impairment loss of approximately $ 7.8 million, which is included in operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2017. 9. GOODWILL, TRADE NAMES/TRADEMARKS AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET Goodwill, Net Goodwill, net, at December 31, 2019 and 2018 relates to the Company’s Discovery Cove reporting unit. The Company performed a qualitative assessment at December 1, 2019 and 2018, and concluded that further evaluation was unnecessary. During 2017, due to financial performance particularly late in the second quarter of 2017 at the Company’s SeaWorld Orlando park, the Company determined a triggering event occurred that required an interim goodwill impairment test for its SeaWorld Orlando reporting unit. Based on financial performance and the resulting impact on projections of future cash flows for this reporting unit at that time, the Company concluded in 2017 that the goodwill related to the SeaWorld Orlando reporting unit was fully impaired and, as a result, recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $ 269.3 million in the accompanying consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss) during the year ended December 31, 2017. The estimated fair value for the SeaWorld Orlando reporting unit was determined using the income approach and represents a Level 3 fair value measurement measured on a non-recurring basis in the fair value hierarchy due to the Company’s use of internal projections and unobservable measurement inputs. Trade Names/Trademarks, Net The Company performed a qualitative assessment for its other indefinite-lived intangible assets at December 1, 2019 and 2018 and concluded that further evaluation was unnecessary. Trade names/trademarks, net, at December 31, 2019, consisted of the following: Weighted Average Amortization Period Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Value (In thousands) Trade names/trademarks - indefinite lives $ 157,000 $ — $ 157,000 Trade names/trademarks- finite lives 9.3 years 12,900 12,900 — Total trade names/trademarks, net $ 169,900 $ 12,900 $ 157,000 F-20 Trade names/trademarks, net, at December 31, 2018 , consisted of the following: Weighted Average Amortization Period Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Value (In thousands) Trade names/trademarks - indefinite lives $ 157,000 $ — $ 157,000 Trade names/trademarks- finite lives 9.3 years 12,900 11,557 1,343 Total trade names/trademarks, net $ 169,900 $ 11,557 $ 158,343 Other Intangible Assets, Net As of December 31, 2019, other intangible assets, net, consisted of other indefinite-lived intangible assets with a gross and net carrying amount of $ 0.5 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company wrote-off fully amortized intangible assets with an aggregate book value and accumulated amortization of $ 22.8 million, which related to reseller agreements and a non-compete agreement. Other intangible assets, net, at December 31, 2018, consisted of the following: Weighted Average Amortization Period Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Value (In thousands) Favorable lease asset 39 years $ 18,200 $ 4,200 $ 14,000 Reseller agreements 8.1 years 22,300 22,300 — Non-compete agreement 5 years 500 500 — Other intangible assets - indefinite lives 120 — 120 Total other intangible assets, net $ 41,120 $ 27,000 $ 14,120 Upon adoption of ASC 842, Leases , on January 1, 2019, the Company reclassified the favorable lease asset above from other intangible assets, net, to right of use assets-operating leases in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. See further details in Note 14 – Leases. Total amortization expense was approximately $ 1.4 million, $ 2.2 million and $ 4.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 10.

LONG-TERM DEBT Long-term debt, net, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 consisted of the following: 2019 2018 (In thousands) Term B-5 Loans (effective interest rate of 4.80 % and 5.52 % at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively) $ 1,507,883 $ 1,523,389 Revolving credit facility (effective interest rate of 4.35 % and 5.17 % at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively) 50,000 30,000 Total long-term debt 1,557,883 1,553,389 Less discounts ( 4,793 ) ( 6,564 ) Less debt issuance costs ( 4,966 ) ( 6,641 ) Less current maturities, including revolving credit facility ( 65,505 ) ( 45,505 ) Total long-term debt, net $ 1,482,619 $ 1,494,679 SEA is the borrower under the senior secured credit facilities, as amended pursuant to a credit agreement (the “Existing Credit Agreement”) dated as of December 1, 2009, as the same may be amended, restated, supplemented or modified from time to time (the “Senior Secured Credit Facilities”). On October 31, 2018, SEA entered into a refinancing amendment, Amendment No. 9 (the “Amended Credit Agreement”), to its Existing Credit Agreement. In connection with the Amended Credit Agreement, SEA borrowed $ 543.9 million of additional term loans (the “Term B-5 Loans”) of which the proceeds, along with cash on hand, were used to redeem all of the then outstanding principal of the Term B-2 loans, and pay other fees, costs and expenses in connection with the Amended Credit Agreement and related transactions. Additionally, pursuant to the Amended Credit Agreement, SEA terminated the then existing revolving credit commitments and replaced them with a new tranche of revolving credit commitments with an aggregate commitment amount of $ 210.0 million (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). In connection with the issuance of the Term B-5 Loans and as a result of the Amended Credit Agreement, SEA recorded a discount of $ 0.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. Additionally, SEA wrote-off debt issuance costs of $ 8.2 million, which is included in loss on early extinguishment of debt and write-off of discounts and debt issuances costs in the accompanying consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss) during the year ended December 31, 2018. On March 31, 2017, SEA entered into Amendment No. 8 (the “Amendment No. 8”) to its Existing Credit Agreement, as a result of Amendment No. 8 in 2017, SEA recorded a discount of $ 5.0 million and immaterial debt issuance costs during the year ended December 31, 2017. Additionally, SEA wrote-off debt issuance costs of $ 8.0 million, which is included in loss on early extinguishment of debt and write-off of discounts and debt issuances costs in the accompanying consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss) during the year ended December 31, 2017. See discussion in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities section which follows for further information. As of December 31, 2019, SEA was in compliance with all covenants contained in the documents governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Senior Secured Credit Facilities As of December 31, 2019, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities consisted of $ 1.508 billion in Term B-5 Loans which will mature on March 31, 2024 and a $ 210.0 million Revolving Credit Facility, of which $ 50.0 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2019. The Revolving Credit Facility will mature on October 31, 2023 . The outstanding balance on the Revolving Credit Facility was included in current maturities of long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 due to the Company’s intent to repay the borrowings within the following twelve month period. Subsequent to December 31, 2019, SEA borrowed an additional $ 45.0 million on the Revolving Credit Facility for general working capital purposes. The Term B-5 Loans amortize in equal quarterly installments, commencing with the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2018, in aggregate annual amounts equal to 1.015 % of the original principal amount of the Term B-5 Loans outstanding on the Effective Date, with the balance payable on the final maturity date. SEA may voluntarily repay amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities at any time without premium or penalty, other than customary “breakage” costs with respect to LIBOR loans. SEA is also required to prepay the outstanding Term B-5 Loans, subject to certain exceptions, with (i) 50 % of SEA’s annual “excess cash flow” (with step-downs to 25 % and 0 %, as applicable, based upon achievement by SEA of a certain secured total leverage ratio), subject to certain exceptions; (ii) 100 % of the net cash proceeds of certain non-ordinary course asset sales or other dispositions subject to reinvestment rights and certain exceptions; and (iii) 100 % of the net cash proceeds of any incurrence of debt by SEA or any of its restricted subsidiaries, other than debt permitted to be incurred or issued under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. F-22 Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, each lender of term loans has the right to reject its pro rata share of mandatory prepayments described above, in which case SEA may retain the amounts so rejected. The foregoing mandatory prepayments will be applied pro rata to installments of term loans in direct order of maturity. During the first quarter of 2017, the Company made a mandatory prepayment of approximately $ 6.3 million based on its excess cash flow calculation as of December 31, 2016. Approximately $ 3.5 million of the mandatory prepayment was accepted by the lenders and applied ratably to the then outstanding Term B-2 and Term B-3 loans prior to Amendment No. 8 on March 31, 2017, and the remainder of $ 2.8 million was applied as a voluntary prepayment to the then outstanding Term B-2 loans in the second quarter of 2017. There were no mandatory prepayments made during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. SEA may go to market to increase and/or add one or more incremental term loan facilities to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and/or increase commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $ 350.0 million. SEA may also incur additional incremental term loans provided that, among other things, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the incurrence of such incremental term loans, the First Lien Secured Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, is no greater than 3.50 to 1.00. The obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities are fully, unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by the Company, any subsidiary of the Company that directly or indirectly owns 100 % of the issued and outstanding equity interests of SEA, and, subject to certain exceptions, each of SEA’s existing and future material domestic wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities are collateralized by first priority or equivalent security interests, subject to certain exceptions, in (i) all the capital stock of, or other equity interests in, substantially all of SEA’s direct or indirect material domestic subsidiaries and 65 % of the capital stock of, or other equity interests in, any “first tier” foreign subsidiaries and (ii) certain tangible and intangible assets of SEA and the Company. Certain financial, affirmative and negative covenants are included in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities will be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor. Term B-5 Loans Borrowings of the Term B-5 Loans under the Amended Credit Agreement bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to, at SEA ’ s option, (i) a base rate equal to the higher of (a) the federal funds rate plus 1/2 of 1% and (b) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as its “ prime rate ” (provided that in no event shall such base rate with respect to the Term B-5 Loans be less than 1.75 % per annum), in each case, plus an applicable margin of 2.00 % or (ii) a LIBOR rate based on the British Bankers Association LIBOR Rate (or any successor thereto) for the applicable interest period (provided that in no event shall such LIBOR rate with respect to the Term B-5 Loans be less than 0.75 % per annum) plus an applicable margin of 3.00 %. Revolving Credit Facility Borrowings of the Revolving Credit Facility under the Amended Credit Agreement bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to, at SEA ’ s option, (i) a base rate equal to the higher of (a) the federal funds rate plus 1⁄2 of 1% and (b) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as its “ prime rate ” , in each case, plus an applicable margin equal to 1.75 %; or (ii) a LIBOR rate based on the British Bankers Association LIBOR Rate (or any successor thereto) for the applicable interest period (provided that in no event shall such LIBOR rate with respect to the Revolving Credit Facility be less than 0.0 % per annum) plus an applicable margin equal to 2.75 %. The applicable margin for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are subject to one 25 basis point step-down upon achievement by SEA of certain corporate credit ratings, which the Company did not achieve as of December 31, 2019. In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, SEA is required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder at a rate of 0.50 % per annum. SEA is also required to pay customary letter of credit fees. As of December 31, 2019, SEA had approximately $ 20.4 million of outstanding letters of credit and $ 50.0 million outstanding on its Revolving Credit Facility, leaving approximately $ 139.6 million available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility. Restrictive Covenants The Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain a number of customary negative covenants. Such covenants, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of SEA and its restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness; make guarantees; create liens on assets; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; engage in mergers or consolidations; sell assets; make fundamental changes; pay dividends and distributions or repurchase SEA’s capital stock; make investments, loans and advances, including acquisitions; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; make changes in the nature of the business; and make prepayments of junior debt. All of the net assets of SEA and its consolidated subsidiaries are restricted and there are no unconsolidated subsidiaries of SEA. F-23 The Amended Credit Agreement removed all previous financial covenants on the Term B-5 Loans. The Revolving Credit Facility requires that SEA comply with a springing maximum first lien secured net leverage ratio of 6.25 x to be tested as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, solely to the extent that on such date the aggregate amount of funded loans and letters of credit (excluding undrawn letters of credit in an amount not to exceed $ 30.0 million and cash collateralized letters of credit) under the Revolving Credit Facility exceeds an amount equal to 35 % of the then outstanding commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities permit restricted payments in an aggregate amount per annum equal to the sum of (A) $ 25.0 million plus (B) an amount, if any, equal to (1) if the total net leverage ratio on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the payment of any such restricted payment, is no greater than 3.50 to 1.00, an unlimited amount, (2) if the total net leverage ratio on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the payment of any such restricted payment is no greater than 4.00 to 1.00 and greater than 3.50 to 1.00, the greater of (a) $ 95.0 million and (b) 7.50 % of Market Capitalization (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities), (3) if the total net leverage ratio on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the payment of any such restricted payment is no greater than 4.50 to 1.00 and greater than 4.00 to 1.00, $ 95.0 million and (4) if the total net leverage ratio on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the payment of any such restricted payment is no greater than 5.00 to 1.00 and greater than 4.50 to 1.00, $ 65.0 million. As of December 31, 2019, the total net leverage ratio as calculated under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 3.24 to 1.00. The available capacity for restricted payments is recalculated at the beginning of each quarter, or upon declaration of a restricted payment, as set forth in the credit agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company used approximately $ 150.0 million of its then available restricted payments capacity for a share repurchase (see Note 17–Related-Party Transactions and Note 20–Stockholders’ Equity for further details). Long-term debt at December 31, 2019, is repayable as follows and does not include the impact of any future voluntary prepayments. The outstanding balance under the Revolving Credit Facility is included below based on the Company’s intent to repay the borrowings within the next twelve months: Years Ending December 31, (In thousands) 2020 $ 65,505 2021 15,505 2022 15,505 2023 15,505 2024 1,445,863 Total $ 1,557,883 Interest Rate Swap Agreements As of December 31, 2019, the Company has five interest rate swap agreements (“the Interest Rate Swap Agreements”) which effectively fix the interest rate on the LIBOR-indexed interest payments associated with $ 1.0 billion of SEA’s outstanding long-term debt through May 14, 2020. The Interest Rate Swap Agreements became effective on September 30, 2016; have a total notional amount of $1.0 billion; mature on May 14, 2020 ; require the Company to pay a weighted-average fixed rate of 2.45 % per annum to swap counterparties; provide that the Company receives a variable rate of interest based upon the greater of 0.75 % or the BBA LIBOR ; and have interest settlement dates occurring on the last day of December, March, June and September through maturity. SEA designated the Interest Rate Swap Agreements above as qualifying cash flow hedge accounting relationships as further discussed in Note 12–Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities which follows. Cash paid for interest relating to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and Interest Rate Swap Agreements, net of amounts capitalized, as applicable, was $ 80.5 million, $ 82.5 million and $ 80.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Cash paid for interest during the year ended December 31, 2017 excludes $ 5.1 million related to the fourth quarter interest payment on its Senior Secured Credit Facilities which was paid on January 5, 2018. See Note 10–Other Accrued Liabilities for accrued interest included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. F-24 12. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Risk Management Objective of Using Derivatives The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources and duration of its debt funding and the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. The Company’s derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing and duration of the Company’s known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to the Company’s borrowings. The Company does not speculate using derivative instruments. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company did no t have any derivatives outstanding that were not designated in hedge accounting relationships. Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk The Company’s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing variable-rate debt. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had five Interest Rate Swap Agreements that mature on May 14, 2020, which effectively fix the interest rate on LIBOR-indexed interest payments associated with $ 1.0 billion of SEA’s outstanding long-term debt through May 14, 2020. The Interest Rate Swap Agreements are designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk. The changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income and are subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company’s variable-rate debt. Through the expiration date of May 14, 2020 , the Company estimates that an additional $ 2.2 million will be reclassified as an increase to interest expense. Tabular Disclosure of Fair Values of Derivative Instruments on the Balance Sheet The table below presents the fair value of the Company’s derivative financial instruments as well as their classification in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2019 and 2018: Liability Derivatives Asset Derivatives As of December 31, 2019 As of December 31, 2018 Balance Sheet Location Fair Value Balance Sheet Location Fair Value Derivatives designated as hedging instruments: (In thousands) Interest rate swap agreements Other liabilities 2,156 Other assets 3,109 Total derivatives designated as hedging instruments $ 2,156 $ 3,109 Derivative instruments are valued according to the methodology outlined in Note 2–Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. The Company has determined that its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as discussed in Note–16 Fair Value Measurements. The unrealized gain or loss on derivatives is recorded net of a tax benefit of $ 1.4 million and a tax expense of $ 3.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and is included in the accompanying consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ equity and the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). F-25 Tabular Disclosure of the Effect of Derivative Instruments on the Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) The table below presents the pre-tax effect of the Company’s derivative financial instruments in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018: 2019 2018 (In thousands) Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships: (Loss) gain recognized in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income $ ( 5,247 ) $ 14,262 Loss reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income to interest expense $ ( 17 ) $ ( 2,697 ) Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features In relation to its Interest Rate Swap Agreements, the Company has agreements with each of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where if the Company defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations. As of December 31, 2019, the termination value of derivatives in a net liability position, which includes accrued interest but excludes any adjustment for nonperformance risk, related to these agreements was $ 2.2 million. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has posted no collateral related to these agreements. If the Company had breached any of these provisions at December 31, 2019, it could have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at their termination value of $ 2.2 million. Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income The following table reflects the changes in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, net of tax: Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income (In thousands): Gains (Losses) on Cash Flow Hedges Accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31, 2017 $ ( 5,076 ) Effects of adoption of ASU 2018-02 ( 1,094 ) Other comprehensive income before reclassifications 10,426 Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income to interest expense ( 1,972 ) Unrealized gain on derivatives, net of tax 8,454 Accumulated other comprehensive income at December 31, 2018 2,284 Other comprehensive loss before reclassifications ( 3,831 ) Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income to interest expense ( 12 ) Unrealized loss on derivatives, net of tax ( 3,843 ) Accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31, 2019 $ ( 1,559 ) 13. INCOME TAXES For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the provision for (benefit from) income taxes is comprised of the following: 2019 2018 2017 Current income tax provision (benefit) (In thousands) Federal $ ( 77 ) $ ( 99 ) $ ( 66 ) State 1,580 1,113 1,525 Foreign 27 7 12 Total current income tax provision 1,530 1,021 1,471 Deferred income tax provision (benefit): Federal 21,825 13,019 ( 74,312 ) State 16,173 3,875 ( 12,165 ) Total deferred income tax provision (benefit) 37,998 16,894 ( 86,477 ) Total income tax provision (benefit) $ 39,528 $ 17,915 $ ( 85,006 ) The deferred income tax provision (benefit) represents the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Cash paid for income taxes totaled $ 1.4 million, $ 0.8 million and $ 0.5 million, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. F-26 The components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 are as follows: 2019 2018 Deferred income tax assets: (In thousands) Acquisition and debt related costs $ 5,550 $ 5,814 Net operating losses 180,693 180,658 Goodwill impairment 54,271 53,972 Self-insurance 7,308 6,847 Deferred revenue 2,546 2,718 Cash flow hedge 571 — Restricted stock 4,411 4,472 Tax credits 10,230 9,317 Legal settlements 8,590 — Lease obligations 32,078 — Other 5,200 7,779 Total deferred income tax assets 311,448 271,577 Valuation allowance ( 5,216 ) ( 2,762 ) Net deferred tax assets 306,232 268,815 Deferred income tax liabilities: Property and equipment ( 225,827 ) ( 192,224 ) Amortization - Goodwill ( 46,688 ) ( 41,803 ) Amortization - Other intangibles ( 22,979 ) ( 18,144 ) Right of use assets ( 31,940 ) — Cash flow hedge — ( 836 ) Other ( 2,558 ) ( 2,992 ) Total deferred income tax liabilities ( 329,992 ) ( 255,999 ) Net deferred income tax (liabilities) assets $ ( 23,760 ) $ 12,816 The Company files federal, state and provincial income tax returns in various jurisdictions with varying statute of limitation expiration dates. Under the tax statute of limitations applicable to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations by the Internal Revenue Service for years before 2015. However, because the Company is carrying forward income tax attributes, such as net operating losses and tax credits from 2009 and subsequent years, these attributes can still be audited when utilized on returns filed in the future. The Company has determined that there are no positions currently taken that would rise to a level requiring an amount to be recorded or disclosed as an unrecognized tax benefit. If such positions do arise, it is the Company’s intent that any interest or penalty amount related to such positions will be recorded as a component of the income tax provision in the applicable period. The Company has federal tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $ 659.1 million as of December 31, 2019 and state net operating loss carryforwards spread across various jurisdictions with a combined total of approximately $ 849.0 million as of December 31, 2019. These net operating loss carryforwards, if not used to reduce taxable income in future periods, will begin to expire in 2029 , for both federal and state tax purposes. Realization of the deferred income tax assets, primarily arising from these net operating loss carryforwards and charitable contribution carryforwards, is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the carryforwards, which may include the reversal of deferred tax liability components. Due to the uncertainty of realizing the benefit from the deferred tax asset recorded for state net operating loss carryforwards, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance of approximately $ 5.2 million and $ 2.8 million, net of federal tax benefit, respectively, on the deferred tax assets related to those state net operating losses. During 2017, an ownership shift of more than 50 percent as defined by the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) Section 382 occurred. The Company determined that, while an ownership shift occurred and limits were determined under Section 382 and the regulations and guidance thereunder, the applicable limits would not impair the value or anticipated use of the Company’s federal and state net operating losses. Although realization is not assured, after consideration of the current valuation allowance related to state net operating loss carryforwards, management believes it is more likely than not that any limitation under IRC Section 382 will not impair the realizability of the net deferred income tax assets related to federal and state tax net operating loss carryforwards. However, the annual limitations may impact the timeframe over which the net operating loss carryforwards can be used, potentially impacting the cash tax liabilities in a future period. F-27 The reconciliation between the statutory income tax rate and the Company’s effective income tax provision (benefit) rate for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, is as follows: 2019 2018 2017 Amount % Amount % Amount % (In thousands) Income tax at federal statutory rates $ 27,091 21.00 % $ 13,167 21.00 % $ ( 100,587 ) 35.00 % State taxes, net of federal benefit 7,645 5.93 4,640 7.40 ( 5,800 ) 2.02 Equity-based compensation ( 1,776 ) ( 1.38 ) 668 1.07 2,901 ( 1.01 ) Tax credits ( 795 ) ( 0.62 ) ( 1,221 ) ( 1.95 ) ( 730 ) 0.25 Goodwill impairment — — — — 17,584 ( 6.12 ) Remeasurement of deferred income tax liabilities resulting from Tax Cuts and Jobs Act — — — — ( 1,808 ) 0.63 Impact of state rate changes 3,770 2.92 ( 379 ) ( 0.60 ) ( 53 ) ( 0.02 ) Nondeductible settlement — — 840 1.34 — — Valuation allowance - state 2,455 1.90 — — 1,688 ( 0.59 ) Other 1,138 0.89 200 0.31 1,799 ( 0.58 ) Income tax provision (benefit) $ 39,528 30.64 % $ 17,915 28.57 % $ ( 85,006 ) 29.58 % On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act makes significant modifications to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, including but not limited to a corporate tax rate decrease from 35 % to 21 % effective as of January 1, 2018. The Company’s net deferred tax assets and liabilities were revalued at the newly enacted U.S. corporate rate in the year of enactment. 14. LEASES The Company has land, warehouse and office space, and equipment leases which are classified as either operating or financing obligations. The Company’s land lease consists of a long-term lease with the City of San Diego covering approximately 190 acres, including approximately 17 acres of water in Mission Bay Park, California (the “Premises”). Under the terms of the lease, the Premises must be used as a marine park facility and related uses. In addition, the Company may not operate another marine park facility within a radius of 560 miles from the City of San Diego. The annual rent under the lease is variable and calculated on the basis of a specified percentage of the Company’s gross income from the Premises, or the minimum yearly rent, whichever is greater. The current lease term for the Premises ends in June 2048 with a corresponding lease liability being amortized using an estimated incremental borrowing rate of 8.2 %. The minimum yearly rent is adjusted every three years to an amount equal to 80 % of the average accounting year rent actually paid for the three previous years. The minimum yearly rent through December 31, 2019 was approximately $ 10.4 million. On January 1, 2020, the minimum annual rent payment was recalculated in accordance with the lease agreement and remained unchanged. Actual payments may vary from the annual straight-line minimum base rent based on a shift of seasonal performance results. Rent payments related to the Premises for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were approximately $ 10.5 million, $ 11.2 million and $ 10.5 million, respectively. Upon adoption of ASC 842, the Company also reclassified a favorable lease asset net balance of approximately $ 14.0 million related to the Premises from other intangible assets, net, to right of use assets-operating in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company has commenced construction of certain new theme park attractions and other projects under contracts with various third parties. At December 31, 2019, excluding certain amounts related to the License Agreement with Sesame Workshop as described below, additional capital payments of approximately $ 143.0 million are necessary to complete these projects. The majority of these projects are expected to be completed in 2021. License Agreements Pursuant to a license agreement (“License Agreement”) with Sesame Workshop, the Company pays a specified annual license fee, as well as a specified royalty based on revenues earned in connection with sales of licensed products, all food and beverage items utilizing the licensed elements and any events utilizing such elements if a separate fee is paid for such event. The Company’s principal commitments pursuant to the License Agreement include, among other items, the opening of a second stand alone park (“Standalone Park”) no later than mid-2021 and minimum annual capital and marketing thresholds. After the opening of the second Standalone Park (counting the existing Sesame Place Standalone Park in Langhorne, Pennsylvania), the Company will have the option to build additional Standalone Parks in the defined territory within agreed upon timelines. The License Agreement has an initial term through December 31, 2031, with an automatic additional 15 year extension plus a five year option added to the term of the License Agreement from December 31st of the year of each new Standalone Park opening. As of December 31, 2019, the Company estimates the combined remaining obligations for the License Agreement commitments could be up to approximately $ 50.0 million over the remaining term of the agreement. In October 2019, the Company announced that it will convert Aquatica San Diego into its second Sesame Place Standalone Park in the spring of 2021. While construction will begin in the fall of 2019, it is not expected to impact Aquatica San Diego’s 2020 operating schedule. F-30 ABI has granted the Company a perpetual, exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use the Busch Gardens trademark and certain related domain name s in connection with the operation, marketing, promotion and advertising of certain of the Company’s theme parks, as well as in connection with the production, use, distribution and sale of merchandise sold in connection with such theme parks. Under the li cense, the Company is required to indemnify ABI against losses related to the use of the marks. Securities Class Action Lawsuits On September 9, 2014, a purported stockholder class action lawsuit consisting of purchasers of the Company’s common stock during the periods between April 18, 2013 to August 13, 2014, captioned Baker v. SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc., et al., Case No. 14-CV-02129-MMA (KSC), was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California against the Company, the Chairman of the Company’s Board, certain of its executive officers and Blackstone. On February 17, 2015, Court-appointed Lead Plaintiffs, Pensionskassen For Børne- Og Ungdomspædagoger and Arkansas Public Employees Retirement System, together with additional plaintiffs, Oklahoma City Employee Retirement System and Pembroke Pines Firefighters and Police Officers Pension Fund (collectively, “Plaintiffs”), filed an amended complaint against the Company, the Chairman of the Company’s Board, certain of its directors, certain of its executive officers, Blackstone, and underwriters of the initial public offering and secondary public offerings. The amended complaint alleges, among other things, that the prospectus and registration statements filed contained materially false and misleading information in violation of the federal securities laws and seeks unspecified compensatory damages and other relief. Plaintiffs contend that defendants knew or were reckless in not knowing that the film Blackfish was impacting SeaWorld’s business at the time of each public statement. On May 31, 2016, Plaintiffs filed a second amended consolidated class action complaint, which, among other things, no longer names the Company’s Board or underwriters as defendants. On February 11, 2020, the Company announced that it had entered into a settlement agreement relating to this case. The proposed settlement, which is subject to certain conditions, including court approval, requires the Company to pay $ 65.0 million for claims alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as the costs of administration and legal fees and expenses. The proposed settlement does not include or constitute an admission, concession, or finding of any fault, liability, or wrongdoing by the Company or any defendant. There can be no assurance that the proposed settlement agreement will be approved by the court. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded $ 32.1 million of legal settlement charges, net of insurance recoveries, related to this case, which is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). On June 14, 2018, a lawsuit captioned Highfields Capital I LP et al v. SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. et al, Case No. 3:18-cv-01276-L-BLM, was filed in the United States District Court in the Southern District of California against the Company and certain of the Company’s former and present executive officers (collectively, the “Defendants”). The plaintiffs, which are investment funds managed by a common adviser (collectively, the “Plaintiffs”) allege, among other things, that the Defendants made false and misleading statements in violation of the federal securities laws and Florida common law, regarding the impact of the film Blackfish on SeaWorld’s business. The complaint further alleges that such statements were made to induce Plaintiffs to purchase common stock of the Company at artificially-inflated prices and that Plaintiffs suffered investment losses as a result. The Plaintiffs are seeking unspecified compensatory damages and other relief. On October 19, 2018, Defendants moved for partial dismissal of the complaint. On February 7, 2019, the Court granted Defendants’ motion and dismissed Plaintiffs’ Florida state law claims as well as federal securities law claims based on the Company’s second quarter 2013 earnings statements. On May 1, 2019, Defendants filed their answer to Plaintiffs’ complaint. On July 1, 2019, the parties filed a joint motion for a stay of all proceedings in the case pending the resolution of the motion for summary judgment filed by Defendants in the related securities class action captioned Baker v. SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc., et al. described above. The Company believes that the lawsuit is without merit and intends to defend the lawsuit vigorously; however, there can be no assurance regarding the ultimate outcome of this lawsuit. Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit On December 8, 2014, a putative derivative lawsuit captioned Kistenmacher v. Atchison, et al., Civil Action No. 10437, was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware against, among others, the Chairman of the Company’s Board, certain of the Company’s executive officers, directors and shareholders, and Blackstone. The Company is a “Nominal Defendant” in the lawsuit. On March 30, 2015, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint against the same set of defendants. The amended complaint alleges, among other things, that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties, aided and abetted breaches of fiduciary duties, violated Florida Blue Sky laws and were unjustly enriched by (i) including materially false and misleading information in the prospectus and registration statements; and (ii) causing the Company to repurchase certain shares of its common stock from certain shareholders at an alleged artificially inflated price. The Company does not maintain any direct exposure to loss in connection with this shareholder derivative lawsuit as the lawsuit does not assert any claims against the Company. The Company’s status as a “Nominal Defendant” in the action reflects the fact that the lawsuit is maintained by the named plaintiff on behalf of the Company and that the plaintiff seeks damages on the Company’s behalf. F-31 On February 11, 2020, the Company announced that it had entered into a binding agreement for the settlement of this case. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company received $ 12.5 million of insurance proceeds from its insurers which can be used for general corporate purposes and will adopt certain corporate governance modifications. The final settlement of the matter remains subject to a formal agreement and court approval. There can be no assurance that the final settlement agreement will be executed or that such agreement will be approved by the court. In the first quarter of 2020, the Company expects to record a legal settlement gain of $ 12.5 million related to insurance proceeds received. Consumer Lawsuit On April 13, 2015, a purported class action was filed in the Superior Court of the State of California for the City and County of San Francisco against SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc., captioned Marc Anderson, et. al., v. SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc. Civil Case No. 15-cv-02172-JSW, (the “Anderson Matter”). The putative class consisted of all consumers within California who, within the past four years, purchased tickets to SeaWorld San Diego. The complaint (as amended) alleges causes of action under the California False Advertising Law, California Unfair Competition Law and California CLRA. Plaintiffs’ claims are based on their allegations that the Company misrepresented the physical living conditions and care and treatment of its killer whales, resulting in confusion or misunderstanding among ticket and orca plush purchasers with intent to deceive and mislead the plaintiffs and purported class members. The complaint seeks restitution, equitable relief, attorneys’ fees and costs. Based on plaintiffs’ definition of the class, the amount in controversy could have exceeded $ 5.0 million assuming the class became certified. The liability exposure is speculative though. On May 14, 2015, the Company removed the case to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The Company filed a motion for summary judgment on October 30, 2017 which the Court granted in part and denied in part. On May 23, 2018, the plaintiffs represented to the Court that they will not file a motion for class certification. The case is no longer a class action. All three named plaintiffs continue to have claims for individual restitution in a nominal amount and injunctive relief. The Court bifurcated the trial of the case into two phases: the plaintiffs’ standing to sue and the merits of their claims. The standing trial is scheduled for March 9, 2020, after which the Court will determine if there needs to be a trial on the merits which currently is scheduled for April 27, 2020. Pre-trial motions and mediation proceedings are continuing. The Company believes that the lawsuit is without merit and intends to defend the lawsuit vigorously; however, there can be no assurance regarding the ultimate outcome of this lawsuit. EZPay Plan Class Action Lawsuit On December 3, 2014, a purported class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division against SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc. The case, captioned Jason Herman, Joey Kratt, and Christina Lancaster, as individuals and on behalf of all others similarly situated, v. SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc. Case no: 8:14-cv-03028-MSS-JSS was certified as a class action in 2018. The Court certified a class action on two claims for relief -- breach of contract and violation of federal Electronic Funds Transfer Act, 15 U.S.C. section 1693 et seq. on behalf of three individual plaintiffs and two classes: (i) individuals in the states of Florida, Texas, Virginia and California who paid for an annual pass through EZ pay in “less than twelve months,” had their passes automatically renewed and did not use the renewed passes after the first year or were not issued a full refund of payments made after the twelfth payment; and (ii) all of these same individuals who used debit cards. In April 2018, the Company reached a preliminary agreement in principle to settle this matter for a payment of $ 11.5 million into a common fund, plus certain administrative costs and expenses associated with the proposed settlement. At a fairness hearing held April 18, 2019, the Court approved the settlement. On April 29, 2019, the Court entered an order approving the final settlement. The Company has funded the $ 11.5 million settlement and is working with a class action administrator to facilitate the settlement in accordance with the terms of the settlement agreement. Other Matters The Company is a party to various other claims and legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business. In addition, from time to time the Company is subject to audits, inspections and investigations by, or receives requests for information from, various federal and state regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”), the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“Cal-OSHA”), the Florida Fish & Wildlife Commission (“FWC”), the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”), the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). In September 2018, the Company reached a settlement with the SEC relating to a previously disclosed SEC investigation. In connection with the settlement, without admitting or denying the substantive allegations in the SEC’s complaint, the Company agreed to the entry of a final judgment ordering the Company to pay a civil penalty of $ 4.0 million and enjoining the Company from violation of certain provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and certain rules thereunder. The settlement is recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 in the Company’s consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). F-32 Other than those matters discussed above, from time to time, various parties also bring other lawsuits against the Company. Matters where an unfavorable outcome to the Com pany is probable and which can be reasonably estimated are accrued. Such accruals, which are not material for any period presented, are based on information known about the matters, the Company’s estimate of the outcomes of such matters, and the Company’s experience in contesting, litigating and settling similar matters. Matters that are considered reasonably possible to result in a material loss are not accrued for, but an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss is disclosed, if such amount or range can be determined. At this time, management does not expect any such known claims, legal proceedings or regulatory matters to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 16. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivative financial instruments using the income approach fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company uses readily available market data to value its derivatives, such as interest rate curves and discount factors. ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement also requires consideration of credit risk in the valuation. The Company uses a potential future exposure model to estimate this credit valuation adjustment (“CVA”). The inputs to the CVA are largely based on observable market data, with the exception of certain assumptions regarding credit worthiness which make the CVA a Level 3 input. Based on the magnitude of the CVA, it is not considered a significant input and the derivatives are classified as Level 2. See Note 12 – Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Of the Company’s long-term obligations, the Term B-5 Loans are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. The fair value of the term loans as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 approximate their carrying value, excluding unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts, due to the variable nature of the underlying interest rates and the frequent intervals at which such interest rates are reset. See Note 11–Long-Term Debt. The Company did no t have any assets measured on a recurring basis at fair value at December 31, 2019. The following table presents the Company’s estimated fair value measurements and related classifications for liabilities measured on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2019: Quoted Prices in Active Markets Significant for Identical Other Significant Assets and Observable Unobservable Balance at Liabilities Inputs Inputs December 31, (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) 2019 Liabilities: (In thousands) Derivative financial instruments (a) $ — $ 2,156 $ — $ 2,156 Long-term obligations (b) $ — $ 1,557,883 $ — $ 1,557,883 (a) Reflected at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet as other liabilities of $ 2.2 million as of December 31, 2019. (b) Reflected at carrying value, net of unamortized debt issuance costs and discounts, in the consolidated balance sheet as current maturities of long-term debt of $ 65.5 million and long-term debt of $ 1.483 billion as of December 31, 2019. There were no transfers between Levels 1, 2 or 3 during the year ended December 31, 2018. The following table presents the Company’s estimated fair value measurements and related classifications for assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2018: Quoted Prices in Active Markets Significant for Identical Other Significant Assets and Observable Unobservable Balance at Liabilities Inputs Inputs December 31, (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3) 2018 Assets: (In thousands) Derivative financial instruments (a) $ — $ 3,109 $ — $ 3,109 Liabilities: Long-term obligations (b) $ — $ 1,553,389 $ — $ 1,553,389 (a) Reflected at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet as other assets of $ 3.1 million as of December 31, 2018.

F-33 17. RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS ZHG Transaction On May 8, 2017 an affiliate of Zhonghong Zhuoye Group Co., Ltd., Sun Wise (UK) Co., LTD (“Sun Wise”) acquired approximately 21 % of the then outstanding shares of common stock of the Company (the “ZHG Transaction”) from certain affiliates of Blackstone (“Sellers”). Subsequent to the ZHG Transaction, Blackstone did not own any remaining shares of the Company. In connection with the ZHG Transaction, Sellers reimbursed the Company for approximately $ 4.0 million of related costs and expenses incurred by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2017. As a result of the ZHG Transaction, Sun Wise held beneficial ownership of 19,452,063 shares (the “Pledged Shares”) of the Company’s common stock. Sun Wise had pledged such shares in connection with certain loan obligations of Sun Wise. Sun Wise subsequently defaulted on such loan obligations and, as a result, PA Eminent Opportunity VI Limited (a controlled affiliate of PAG (f/k/a Pacific Alliance Group)) and China Huarong International Holdings Limited (together, the “Lenders”) foreclosed on the Pledged Shares and, accordingly, the Pledged Shares were transferred to a security agent for the Lenders (the “Security Agent”) on May 3, 2019. On May 27, 2019, the Security Agent entered into a share repurchase agreement with the Company pursuant to which the Security Agent agreed to sell and the Company agreed to purchase 5,615,874 of the Pledged Shares held by the Security Agent at a price per share equal to $ 26.71 (the “SEAS Repurchase”) for a total cost of approximately $ 150.0 million. The SEAS Repurchase closed on May 30, 2019 . On May 27, 2019, the Security Agent also entered into a stock purchase agreement with Hill Path Capital LP (“Hill Path”) and certain of its affiliates pursuant to which the Security Agent agreed to sell and certain affiliates of Hill Path agreed to purchase, in the aggregate, 13,214,000 of the Pledged Shares held by the Security Agent at a price per share equal to $ 26.71 (the “HP Purchase”). The purchase closed on May 30, 2019 , at which time, Hill Path’s ownership percentage increased to 34.6 %. See Note 20 – Stockholder’s Equity for further details. ZHG Agreements As discussed in Note 4–Revenues, in March 2017, the Company entered into the ZHG Agreements. In April 2019, the Company terminated the ZHG Agreements for non-payment of undisputed amounts owed. As of December 31, 2018, a receivable related to the ZHG Agreements of approximately $ 1.5 million was included in accounts receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. See Note 4–Revenues for further details including amounts recorded as revenue related to the ZHG Agreements. Hill Path Capital LP Agreements On November 5, 2017 , the Company and Hill Path entered into a Cooperation Agreement (the “Cooperation Agreement”) and certain related agreements. Under the terms of the Cooperation Agreement, the Company paid Hill Path $ 0.5 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 to reimburse for fees and expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation and execution of the Cooperation Agreement. Pursuant to the Cooperation Agreement, on November 5, 2017, the Company’s Board appointed a designee from Hill Path to the Board and the Revenue Committee of the Board, immediately following the execution of the Cooperation Agreement. On May 27, 2019, in connection with the HP Purchase, the Company concurrently entered into a stockholders agreement, a registration rights and the Amended and Restated Undertaking Agreement with Hill Path (collectively, the “HP Agreements”). Under the HP Agreements, the Company agreed to appoint up to three Hill Path director designees to its Board and Hill Path agreed to certain customary standstill obligations, restrictions regarding the manner of sale of shares, and equal treatment for any change in control transaction. In addition, Hill Path agreed that shares held in excess of 24.9 % generally would be voted consistent with the Board’s recommendations or consistent with the shares voted by the Company’s other stockholders. The Company also agreed to reimburse Hill Path for up to $ 250,000 of their expenses in connection with the HP Agreements. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company reimbursed Hill Path for $ 250,000 in expenses incurred. 18. RETIREMENT PLAN The Company sponsors a defined contribution plan, under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. During 2019, 2018 and 2017, the plan was a qualified automatic contributions arrangement, which automatically enrolled employees, once eligible, unless they opted out. The Company made matching cash contributions subject to certain restrictions, structured as a 100 % match on the first 1 % contributed by the employee and a 50 % match on the next 5 % contributed by the employee. Effective January 1, 2020, the plan removed the automatic contributions arrangement and amended the matching cash contributions structure going forward to be a 50 % match on the first 4 % of eligible pay contributed by the employee. Employer matching contributions for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, totaled $ 7.5 million, $ 7.6 million and $ 7.9 million, respectively, and is included in selling, general and administrative expenses and in operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).

Equity compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes approximately $ 8.4 million related to certain of the Company’s performance-vesting restricted shares (see the 2.75x Performance Restricted shares section which follows for further details). Total unrecognized equity compensation expense for all equity compensation awards probable of vesting as of December 31, 2019 was approximately $ 22.7 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years. The total fair value of shares which vested during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was approximately $ 9.7 million, $ 12.1 million and $ 13.8 million, respectively. The weighted average grant date fair value per share of time-vesting and performance-vesting restricted awards granted during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were $ 26.55 , $ 15.40 and $ 17.71 per share, respectively. The activity related to the Company’s time-vesting and performance-vesting restricted awards during the year ended December 31, 2019 was as follows: Performance-Vesting Restricted Awards Time-Vesting Restricted Awards Bonus Performance Restricted Awards Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Awards Shares/Units Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value per Award Shares/Units Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value per Award Shares/Units Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value per Award Outstanding at December 31, 2018 901,704 $ 17.34 560,710 $ 15.06 1,155,486 $ 15.82 Granted 270,540 $ 27.16 395,351 $ 26.04 1,583,791 $ 26.57 Vested ( 221,571 ) $ 17.22 ( 331,811 ) $ 15.06 ( 55,469 ) $ 15.61 Forfeited ( 224,762 ) $ 17.17 ( 290,577 ) $ 17.33 ( 827,980 ) $ 21.78 Outstanding at December 31, 2019 725,911 $ 21.08 333,673 $ 26.10 1,855,828 $ 22.34 The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $ 2.4 million and $ 1.7 million, respectively and immaterial during the year ended December 31, 2017. The activity related to the Company’s stock option awards during the year ended December 31, 2019 was as follows: Options Weighted Average Exercise Price Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Life (in years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in thousands) Outstanding at December 31, 2018 764,577 $ 18.05 Granted 606,343 $ 26.83 Forfeited ( 237,209 ) $ 23.69 Expired ( 8,593 ) $ 18.52 Exercised ( 211,096 ) $ 17.98 Outstanding at December 31, 2019 914,022 $ 22.43 7.49 $ 8,491 Exercisable at December 31, 2019 399,701 $ 18.30 5.72 $ 5,359 F-35 The weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted during the year ended December 31, 2019 was $ 9.41 . Key weighted-average assumptions utilized in the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model for stock options granted during the year ended December 31, 2019 were: Risk-free interest rate 2.27 % Expected volatility (a) 31.44 % Expected dividend yield 0.00 % Expected life (years) (b) 6.00 (a) Prior to April 2019, due to the Company’s limited history as a public company, the volatility for the Company’s stock was estimated using the average volatility calculated for a peer group, which was based upon daily price observations over the estimated term of options granted. (b) The expected life was estimated using the simplified method, as the Company does not have sufficient historical exercise data due to the limited period of time its common stock has been publicly traded. The Company recognizes equity compensation expense for its performance-vesting restricted awards ratably over the related performance period, if the performance condition is probable of being achieved. If the probability of vesting related to these awards changes in a subsequent period, all equity compensation expense related to those awards that would have been recorded over the requisite service period had the awards been considered probable at the new percentage from inception, will be recorded as a cumulative catch-up at such subsequent date. Omnibus Incentive Plan The Company has reserved 15,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the Company’s Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Omnibus Incentive Plan”), of which approximately 8,480,000 are available for future issuance as of December 31, 2019. Bonus Performance Restricted Awards During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company granted performance-vesting restricted units (the “Bonus Performance Restricted Awards”) in accordance with its annual bonus plan for 2019 (the “2019 Bonus Plan”). The 2019 Bonus Plan provides for bonus awards payable 50 % in cash and 50 % in Bonus Performance Restricted Awards and is based upon the Company’s achievement of specified performance goals, as defined by the 2019 Bonus Plan, with respect to the year ended December 31, 2019 (the “Fiscal 2019”). The total number of units eligible to vest into shares of stock is based on the level of achievement of the targets for Fiscal 2019 which ranges from 0 % (if below threshold performance) and up to 200 % (at or above maximum performance). Separately, on October 3, 2019, in connection with its regular review of compensation matters, the Compensation Committee of the Board, approved certain equity awards designed to recognize employees for their contribution and continued expected contribution to the Company and its goals (the “October 2019 Grant”). A portion of these awards were in the form of performance-vesting restricted units which are eligible to vest based on achievement of specific performance goals with respect to Fiscal 2019. In accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation , equity compensation expense is recorded on shares probable of vesting. Based on the Company’s actual Fiscal 2019 results with respect to specific performance goals, a portion of the outstanding performance-vesting restricted awards related to the Fiscal 2019 performance goals were considered probable of vesting as of December 31, 2019; therefore, equity compensation expense has been recorded related to these awards. These awards are expected to vest in accordance with their terms, at which time any unearned units will forfeit. The Company also had an annual bonus plan for the year ended December 31, 2018 (the “Fiscal 2018”), under which certain employees were eligible to vest in performance-vesting restricted units based upon the Company’s achievement of specified performance goals with respect to Fiscal 2018. Based on the Company’s actual Fiscal 2018 results, a portion of these units vested in the year ended December 31, 2019 and the remainder forfeited in accordance with their terms. 2019 Long-Term Incentive Awards During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company granted long-term incentive plan awards for 2019 (the “2019 Long-Term Incentive Grant”) which were comprised of nonqualified stock options (the “Long-Term Incentive Options”) and performance-vesting restricted units (the “Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Units”) (collectively, the “Long-Term Incentive Awards”). Long-Term Incentive Awards for 2019, 2020 and 2021 combined were granted to certain employees during the year ended December 31, 2019. F-36 Long-Term Incentive Options The Long-Term Incentive Options generally vest over three years , with one-third vesting on each anniversary of the date of grant, subject to continued employment through the applicable vesting date. Equity compensation expense for these options is recognized for each tranche over the three year vesting period using the straight line method. Upon stock option exercises, authorized but unissued shares are issued by the Company. Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Units The Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Units originally granted in 2019 (the “2019 LTIP Performance Awards”) contained a three-year performance period consisting of the 2019-2021 calendar years (or, extended through the end of the 2022 calendar year, as applicable) and were eligible to vest based upon the Company’s achievement of specific performance goals for the performance period, as defined by the 2019 Long-Term Incentive Grant. The total number of Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Units eligible to vest will be based on the level of achievement of the performance goals and ranges from 0 % (if below threshold performance) up to 100 % (for target or above performance). Upon achievement of the performance goals, only 50% of the award for a given level of performance will vest, with the remaining 50% subject to a one-year performance test period. The goal achieved must be met again or exceeded the next fiscal year before the remaining units are earned. In November 2019, certain performance-vesting restricted stock units were granted to the Company’s new Chief Executive Officer (the “CEO Performance Awards”). The CEO Performance Awards have a three-year performance period consisting of the 2020-2022 calendar years (or, extended through the end of the 2023 calendar year, as applicable) which are eligible to vest based upon the Company’s achievement of specific performance goals for the performance period, as defined by the CEO Performance Awards. The performance period and the performance goals for the CEO Performance Awards differed from those of the 2019 LTIP Performance Awards, as such, o n February 25, 2020, the Board approved a modification (the “Modification”) to the 2019 LTIP Performance Awards in order to better align its terms with those of the CEO Performance Awards. The Compensation Committee of the Board determined that it was preferable to align the 2019 LTIP Performance Awards with the CEO Performance Awards to put everyone on the same performance cycle with the same performance goals. Pursuant to the Modification, the threshold and target performance goals were revised to align with the CEO Performance Awards threshold and target performance goals and the performance period was extended through calendar year 2022 (or, the end of the 2023 calendar year, as applicable) consistent with the CEO Performance Awards. Equity compensation expense has not yet been recorded related to these awards. The Company will use the respective modification date fair value to record equity compensation expense related to the Modification awards when and if they become probable of vesting in a future period, in accordance with the guidance in ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation . Other Long-Term Incentive Awards During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company also granted time-vesting restricted units which vest over three years to certain employees, with one-third vesting on each anniversary of the date of grant, subject to continued employment through the applicable vesting date. Separately, as part of the October 2019 Grant, time-vesting restricted units were also granted which will vest 50 % on each of the first two anniversaries of the grant date, subject to the recipient’s continued employment on each such vesting date. Equity compensation expense related to these awards is recognized using the straight line method. Previous Long-Term Incentive Awards The Company also has outstanding time-vesting restricted awards (the “Long-Term Incentive Time Restricted Awards”), performance-vesting restricted awards (the “Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Awards”) and Long-Term Incentive Options granted under previous long-term incentive plan grants. During the year ended December 31, 2019, a portion of the previously granted Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Awards related to completed performance periods vested, with the remainder forfeiting in accordance with their terms. The remaining outstanding Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Awards related to future performance periods are eligible to vest based upon the Company’s achievement of pre-established performance goals for the respective performance period, as defined. Based on the Company’s actual results for 2019, a portion of the previously granted Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Awards related to the performance period which ended on December 31, 2019 are expected to vest in the first quarter of 2020, with the remainder forfeiting in accordance with their terms. 2.75x Performance Restricted Shares The Company had awarded under its previous incentive plans certain performance-vesting restricted shares (the “2.75x Performance Restricted shares”). During the first quarter of 2017, the Company modified certain 2.75x Performance Restricted shares to vest 60 % upon the closing of the ZHG Transaction on May 8, 2017 (see Note 17–Related-Party Transactions). The remaining outstanding unvested 2.75x Performance Restricted shares forfeited in the second quarter of 2018. F-37 As the modification discussed above was based on a liquidity event, for accounting purposes, the 2.75x Performance Restricted shares were not considered probable of vesting until such time the ZHG Transaction was consummated. In accordance with the guidance in ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation , as the 2.75x Performance Restricted shares were not considered probable of vesting before or after the date of modification, the Company used the respective modification date fair value to record equity compensation expense related to the modified shares when the liquidity event occurred. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized non-cash equity compensation expense related to all of the 2.75x Performance Restricted shares of approximately $ 8.4 million and paid cash accumulated dividends related to previous dividend declarations of approximately $ 1.3 million. Other During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company granted equity awards to its non-employee members of its Board which will vest on the day before the Company’s next annual meeting. Each eligible Board member elected the form of their equity award as either deferred stock units (“DSUs”) or restricted stock units (“RSUs”). Each DSU granted in 2019 represents the right to receive one share of the Company’s common stock three months after the respective director leaves the Board. Upon vesting, each RSU will be converted into one share of the Company’s common stock. 20. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY As of December 31, 2019, 94,044,203 shares of common stock were issued in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, which includes 15,790,463 shares of treasury stock held by the Company (see Share Repurchase Program discussion below), but excludes 474,460 unvested shares of common stock and 2,440,952 unvested restricted stock units held by certain participants in the Company’s equity compensation plans (see Note 19–Equity-Based Compensation). Share Repurchase Program The Board previously authorized the repurchase of up to $ 250.0 million of the Company’s common stock (the “Share Repurchase Program”). Under the Share Repurchase Program, the Company is authorized to repurchase shares through open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans and under Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. The Share Repurchase Program has no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued completely at any time. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company completed a share repurchase of 5,615,874 shares (see discussion relating to the SEAS Repurchase in Note 17–Related Party Transactions for further details). On August 2, 2019, the Company’s Board approved a replenishment to the Share Repurchase Program of $ 150.0 million, bringing the total amount authorized for future share repurchases back up to $ 250.0 million. As of December 31, 2019, $ 250.0 million remained available for future share repurchases. The number of shares to be purchased and the timing of purchases will be based on the Company’s trading windows and available liquidity, general business and market conditions and other factors, including legal requirements and alternative opportunities. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company repurchased a total of 3,654,816 shares of common stock at a total cost of approximately $ 98.0 million. No shares were repurchased by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2017. All shares repurchased pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program, along with shares repurchased directly from selling stockholders concurrently with previous secondary offerings, are recorded as treasury stock at a total cost of $ 402.9 million and $ 252.9 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and are reflected as a reduction to stockholders’ equity in the accompanying consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ equity. Dividends In 2016, the Board suspended the Company’s then existing quarterly dividend policy to allow greater flexibility to deploy capital to opportunities that offer the greatest long term returns to shareholders, such as, but not limited to, investments in new attractions, debt repayments or share repurchases. For the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately $ 1.5 million of accumulated dividends were paid related to shares which vested during the respective year and is reflected in other financing activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. These shares, which were granted prior to the dividend suspension, carried dividend rights and therefore the dividends accumulated and were paid when the shares vested in accordance with the underlying equity compensation grants. Accumulated dividends paid for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were not material. 21. SEVERANCE AND OTHER SEPARATION COSTS The Company is committed to continuous improvement and regularly evaluates operations to ensure it is properly organized for performance and efficiency. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded approximately $ 4.2 million in pre-tax charges primarily consisting of severance and other termination benefits, which is included in severance and other separation costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). As of December 31, 2019, a liability of $ 0.4 million, which primarily relates to severance and other separation costs to be paid as contractually obligated by December 31, 2020, is included in accrued salaries, wages and benefits in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. F-38 In August 2018, the Company announced a restructuring program (the “2018 Restructuring Program”) focused on reducing costs, improving operating margins and streamlining its management structure to create efficiencies and better align with its strategic business objectives. The 2018 Restructuring Program involved the elimination of approximately 125 positions during the third quarter of 2018 across the Company’s theme parks and its corporate headquarters. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded approximately $ 5.5 million in pre-tax restructuring charges primarily related to severance and other termination benefits, which is included in severance and other separation costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). The Company will not incur any additional costs associated with the 2018 Restructuring Program as all continuing service obligations were completed as of December 31, 2018 . In October 2017, the Company executed a restructuring program in an effort to reduce costs, increase efficiencies, reduce duplication of functions and improve the Company’s operations (the “2017 Restructuring Program”). The 2017 Restructuring Program involved the elimination of approximately 350 positions by the end of the fourth quarter of 2017 across certain of the Company’s theme parks and corporate headquarters. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded approximately $ 5.2 million in pre-tax restructuring charges primarily related to severance and other termination benefits, which is included in severance and other separation costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). The Company will not incur any additional costs associated with the 2017 Restructuring Program as all continuing service obligations were completed as of December 31, 2017. The 2018 and 2017 Restructuring Program activity for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was as follows: 2017 Restructuring Program 2018 Restructuring Program (In thousands) Liability as of December 31, 2017 $ 1,234 $ — Costs incurred — 5,548 Payments made ( 1,234 ) ( 5,011 ) Liability as of December 31, 2018 $ — $ 537 Costs incurred — — Payments made — ( 537 ) Liability as of December 31, 2019 $ — $ — Other Separation Costs Severance and other separation costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 also includes severance and other employment expenses for other positions not part of a larger restructuring program and includes certain executives who stepped down from their respective positions during 2018. In particular, on February 27, 2018, the Company announced that its President and Chief Executive Officer (the “Former CEO”) had stepped down from his position and resigned as a member of the Board. In connection with his departure, the Former CEO received a lump sum cash payment of approximately $ 6.7 million in severance-related benefits, in accordance with his employment agreement. Certain other executives who separated from the Company during the first half of 2018 also received severance-related benefits of approximately $ 3.8 million in accordance with the terms of their respective employment agreements or relevant company plan, as applicable. These severance expenses are included in severance and other separation costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2018. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2018, certain equity awards were accelerated to vest in connection with the departure of specific executives as required by their respective employment agreements. As a result, the Company recorded incremental non-cash equity compensation expense related to these awards, which is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). See Note 19–Equity-Based Compensation for further details. F-39 22.

(“SEA”), which owns and operates twelve theme parks within the United States. Accordingly, the Parent is dependent upon distributions from SEA to fund its obligations. However, under the terms of SEA’s various debt agreements, SEA’s ability to pay dividends or lend to the Parent is restricted, except that SEA may pay specified amounts to the Parent to fund the payment of the Parent’s tax obligations. 2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION The accompanying condensed financial statements (the “parent company only financial statements”) include the accounts of the Parent and its investment in SEA accounted for in accordance with the equity method and do not present the financial statements of the Parent and its subsidiary on a consolidated basis. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted since this information is included with the SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “consolidated financial statements”). These parent company only financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements. 3. GUARANTEES SEA is the borrower under the senior secured credit facilities, (the “Senior Secured Credit Facilities”) under a credit agreement (the “Existing Credit Agreement”) dated as of December 1, 2009, as the same may be amended, restated, supplemented or modified from time to time. On October 31, 2018, SEA entered into a refinancing amendment, Amendment No. 9 (the “Amended Credit Agreement”), to its Existing Credit Agreement. In connection with the Amended Credit Agreement, SEA borrowed additional term loans (the “Term B-5 Loans”) of which the proceeds, along with cash on hand, were used to redeem all of the then outstanding principal of the Term B-2 loans. Additionally, pursuant to the Amended Credit Agreement, SEA terminated the existing revolving credit commitments and replaced them with a new tranche of revolving credit commitments (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). On March 31, 2017, SEA entered into a refinancing amendment, Amendment No. 8 (the “Amendment No. 8”), to its Existing Credit Agreement and borrowed additional term loans of which the proceeds, along with cash on hand, were used to redeem all of the then outstanding Term B-3 loans and a portion of then outstanding principal of the Term B-2 loans. See further discussion in Note 11–Long-Term Debt of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Under the terms of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the obligations of SEA are fully, unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by Parent, any subsidiary of Parent that directly or indirectly owns 100 % of the issued and outstanding equity interest of SEA, and subject to certain exceptions, each of SEA’s existing and future material domestic wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the “Guarantors”). 4. DIVIDENDS FROM SUBSIDIARY In 2016, SEA’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) had a policy to pay, subject to legally available funds, regular quarterly cash dividends to the Parent (defined as a restricted payment in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities) and the Parent’s Board had a policy to pay regular quarterly cash dividends to its stockholders. In September 2016, both SEA’s Board and the Parent’s Board suspended the quarterly dividend policy to allow greater flexibility to deploy capital, when possible, to opportunities that offer the greatest long term returns to shareholders, such as, but not limited to, investments in new attractions, debt repayments or share repurchases. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, SEA paid dividends to the Parent of approximately $ 150.0 million and $ 98.0 million, respectively. The dividends were in the form of payments that SEA made for share repurchases at the Parent level (see Note 5–Stockholders’ Equity which follows). During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, Parent paid accumulated dividends, net of forfeitures, related to shares that carried dividend rights which vested during the respective year. See further discussion in Note 20–Stockholders’ Equity of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. F-44 5. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY Omnibus Incentive Plan The Parent has reserved 15,000,000 shares of common stock for future issuance under the Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Omnibus Incentive Plan”), of which approximately 8,480,000 are available for future issuance as of December 31, 2019. The Omnibus Incentive Plan is administered by the compensation committee of the Parent’s Board, and provides that the Parent may grant equity incentive awards to eligible employees, directors, consultants or advisors of the Parent or its subsidiary, SEA, in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other stock-based and performance compensation awards. If an award under the Omnibus Incentive Plan expires or is canceled, forfeited, or terminated, without issuance to the participant, the unissued shares may be granted again under the Omnibus Incentive Plan. See further discussion in Note 19–Equity-Based Compensation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, Parent transferred approximately $ 3.7 million and $ 4.2 million in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options to SEA as a capital contribution and increased its investment in SEA. Share Repurchase Program The Parent’s Board previously authorized the repurchase of up to $ 250.0 million of the Company’s common stock (the “Share Repurchase Program”). Under the Share Repurchase Program, the Parent is authorized to repurchase shares through open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans and under Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. The Share Repurchase Program has no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued completely at any time. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Parent repurchased a total of 5,615,874 shares of common stock at a total cost of $ 150.0 million. On August 2, 2019 the Parent’s Board approved a replenishment to the Share Repurchase Program of $ 150.0 million, bringing the total amount authorized for future share repurchases back up to $ 250.0 million as of December 31, 2019. The number of shares to be purchased and the timing of purchases will be based on the Parent’s trading windows and available liquidity, general business and market conditions and other factors, including legal requirements and alternative opportunities. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Parent repurchased a total of 3,654,816 shares of common stock at a total cost of approximately $ 98.0 million. There were no share repurchases during the year ended December 31, 2017. All shares repurchased pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program, along with shares repurchased directly from selling stockholders concurrently with previous secondary offerings, are recorded as treasury stock at a total cost of $ 402.9 million and $ 252.9 million as of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and are reflected as a reduction to stockholders’ equity in the accompanying condensed balance sheets.

Business Company Overview We are a leading theme park and entertainment company providing experiences that matter and inspiring guests to protect animals and the wild wonders of our world. We own or license a portfolio of recognized brands including SeaWorld, Busch Gardens, Aquatica, Discovery Cove, Sesame Place and Sea Rescue. Over our more than 50 year history, we have developed a diversified portfolio of 12 destination and regional theme parks that are grouped in key markets across the United States, many of which showcase our one-of-a-kind zoological collection. Our theme parks feature a diverse array of rides, shows, educational demonstrations and other attractions with broad demographic appeal which deliver memorable experiences and a strong value proposition for our guests. During 2018, we hosted approximately 22.6 million guests in our theme parks, generated total revenues of $1.37 billion and reported net income of $44.8 million. We generate revenue primarily from selling admission to our theme parks and from purchases of food, merchandise and other spending. Theme park admissions accounted for approximately 58% of our total revenue, and food, merchandise and other revenue accounted for approximately 42% of our total revenue. For more information concerning our results from operations, see the “ Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As one of the world’s foremost zoological organizations and a global leader in animal welfare, training, husbandry, veterinary care and marine animal rescue, we are committed to helping protect and preserve the environment and the natural world. For more information, see the “—Animal Care and Rescue ”, “—Sustainable Operations” and “—Conservation and Community Relations” sections included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Recent Developments Leadership Changes On February 5, 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors (the “Board”) appointed Gustavo (“Gus”) Antorcha to serve as Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) of the Company. In addition, the Board increased the size of the Board from eight to nine directors and elected Mr. Antorcha to serve as a director. Mr. Antorcha assumed his CEO role and director role, in each case, effective on February 18, 2019. In connection with the appointment of Mr. Antorcha as CEO, the Board appointed John T. Reilly, who will step down from the position of Interim CEO, to serve as Chief Operating Officer (“COO”) of the Company, effective at such time. A dditionally, we announced that Yoshikazu Maruyama would resume his role as non-executive Chairman of the Board, effective February 18, 2019. Share Repurchase Program and Share Repurchases Our Board previously authorized the repurchase of up to $250.0 million of our common stock (the “Share Repurchase Program”). During the fourth quarter of 2018, we repurchased a total of 3,654,816 shares of common stock at a total cost of approximately $98.0 million, leaving approximately $92.0 million available under the Share Repurchase Program as of December 31, 2018. All of the repurchased common stock are held as treasury shares at December 31, 2018. On February 22, 2019, our Board authorized a replenishment to the Share Repurchase Program of $158.0 million, bringing the total amount authorized for future share repurchases to $250.0 million. The Share Repurchase Program has no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued completely at any time. The number of shares to be purchased and the timing of purchases will be based on our trading windows and available liquidity, general business and market conditions and other factors, including legal requirements and alternative opportunities. Debt Refinance On October 31, 2018, we entered into a refinancing amendment, Amendment No. 9 (the “Amended Credit Agreement”), to our senior secured credit facilities (the “Senior Secured Credit Facilities”). In connection with the Amended Credit Agreement, we borrowed $543.9 million of additional term loans (the “Additional Term B-5 Loans”) of which the proceeds, along with cash on hand, were used to redeem all of the then outstanding principal of the Term B-2 Loans, and pay other fees, costs and expenses in connection with the Amended Credit Agreement and related transactions. The Term B-5 Loans mature on March 31, 2024. Additionally, pursuant to the Amended Credit Agreement, we terminated the existing revolving credit commitments and replaced them with a new tranche of revolving credit commitments with an aggregate commitment amount of $210.0 million (the “New Revolving Credit Facility”) with a maturity date of October 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2018, our senior secured credit facilities consisted of $1.523 billion in Term B-5 Loans, along with the New Revolving Credit Facility, of which $30.0 million was drawn upon as of December 31, 2018. See Note 12–Long-Term Debt in our notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 3 Our Competitive Strengths • Brands That Consumers Know and Love. We believe our brands attract and appeal to guests from around the world. We use our brands, intellectual property and the work we do to care for animals to increase awareness of our theme parks, drive attendance to our theme parks and create “out-of-park” experiences for our guests as a way to connect with them before they visit our theme parks and to stay connected with them after their visit. Such experiences include various consumer product offerings, including websites, advertisements, toys, books, apparel and technology accessories. • Differentiated Theme Parks. We own and operate 12 theme parks which deliver high-quality entertainment, aesthetic appeal, shopping and dining. Our portfolio includes theme parks ranked among the most highly attended in the industry, including three of the top 20 theme parks and three of the top 10 water parks in North America, as measured by attendance ( TEA/AECOM 2017 Report ). We have over 650 attractions that appeal to guests of all ages, including 85 animal habitats, 118 shows and 199 rides. In addition, we have over 350 restaurants, photo and specialty retail shops. Our theme parks appeal to the entire family and offer a broad range of experiences, ranging from emotional and educational animal encounters to thrilling rides and exciting shows. In fact, we have won numerous awards and recognition, including the World’s Most Beautiful Amusement Park for 28 consecutive years for Busch Gardens Williamsburg ( National Amusement Park Historical Association, 2018 Survey) , the Nation’s Best Outdoor Waterpark for Aquatica Orlando ( USA Today , 10 Best Readers’ Choice Awards, 2018 ) and Orlando’s Best Theme Park for SeaWorld Orlando ( Orlando Sentinel, 2017). Our theme parks also feature eight of the top 50 steel roller coasters in the world, led by Apollo’s Chariot, the #6 rated steel roller coaster in the world (Amusement Today, 2018) . Additionally, we have won the top three spots for Best Marine Life Park since the award’s inception in 2006, including the top four spots in 2018 and 2017 ( Amusement Today, 2017-2018 ). As a result of these distinctive offerings and experiences, our guest surveys routinely report very high “Overall Satisfaction” scores, with 96% of respondents in 2018 ranking their experience good or excellent. • Diversified Business Portfolio. Our portfolio of theme parks is diversified in a number of important respects. Our theme parks are located in geographic clusters across the United States, which at times can help protect us from the impact of localized events. Each theme park showcases a different mix of thrill-oriented and family friendly attractions. This varied portfolio of entertainment offerings attracts guests from a broad range of demographics and geographies. Our theme parks appeal to both regional and destination guests, which provide us with a diversified attendance base. • One of the World’s Largest Zoological Collections. We provide care for what we believe is one of the world’s largest zoological collections. We believe we are attractively positioned in the industry due to our highly unique collection and ability to present our animals in a differentiated and interactive manner. Through opportunities to explore and interact with these amazing animals in our parks, each year we educate millions of guests with the goal of inspiring them to care and protect animals and their habitats in the wild. Our commitment to these animals includes applying world-class standards of care while striving to provide habitats that promote their health. We also lead, partner with and/or sponsor research efforts that have provided and will continue to provide essential information and tools to help protect and sustain species in their natural habitats around the world. See the “— Conservation & Community Relations ” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. • Strong Competitive Position. Our competitive position is enhanced by the combination of our powerful brands, extensive zoological collection and expertise and attractive in-park assets located on valuable real estate. Our zoological collection and expertise, which have evolved over our more than five decades of caring for animals, would be extremely difficult and expensive to replicate. We have made extensive investments in new attractions and infrastructure and we believe that our theme parks are well capitalized (see the “— Capital Improvements” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of new rides and attractions). We believe that the limited supply of real estate suitable for theme park development coupled with high initial capital investment, long development lead-times and zoning and other land use restrictions constrain the number of large theme parks that can be constructed. • Proven and Experienced Management Team and Employees with Specialized Animal Expertise. Our senior management team, currently led by Gus Antorcha, Chief Executive Officer, includes some of the most experienced executives in the world, with an average tenure of approximately 16 years in relevant industries. The management team is comprised of highly skilled and dedicated professionals with wide ranging experience in theme park operations, zoological operations, product development, business development, marketing, finance and accounting. Additionally, our animal care team is among the most experienced and qualified in the world, making us a global leader in animal welfare, husbandry, enrichment and veterinary care. 4 • Proximity of Complementary Theme Parks. Our theme parks are grouped in key locat ions near large population centers and/or tourism destinations across the United States, which allows us to realize revenue and operating expense efficiencies. Having complementary theme parks located within close proximity to each other also enables us to cross market and offer bundled ticket and vacation packages. In addition, closely located theme parks provide operating efficiencies including sales, marketing, procurement and administrative synergies as overhead expenses are shared among the theme parks within each region. • Significant Cash Flow Generation. We believe that our disciplined approach to capital expenditures and working capital management enables us to generate significant annual operating cash flow, even in years of declining performance. Five of our 12 theme parks are open year-round, reducing our seasonal cash flow volatility. • Care for Our Community and the Natural World. We are committed to the communities in which our theme parks are located and focus our philanthropic efforts in three areas: animal preservation and stewardship; youth development and education; and community initiatives that address environmental sustainability. Our theme parks inspire and educate children and guests of all ages through experiences that are fun and meaningful. We also partner with charities across the country whose values and missions are aligned with our own by providing financial support, in-kind resources, strategic guidance, and/or hands-on volunteer work. For example, we are the primary supporter and corporate member of the SeaWorld & Busch Gardens Conservation Fund, a non-profit conservation foundation, which makes grants to wildlife research and conservation projects that protect wildlife and wild places worldwide. In addition, we operate one of the world’s most respected rescue programs for ill and injured marine animals, in collaboration with federal, state and local governments, and other members of accredited stranding networks, among others, with the goal of rehabilitating and returning them to the wild. For more than five decades, our animal experts have helped more than 34,000 ill, injured, orphaned and abandoned wild animals. We are committed to animal rescue, conservation research and education and invest millions annually in these efforts. Our Theme Parks Our legacy started in 1959 with the opening of our first Busch Gardens theme park in Tampa, Florida. Since then, we have developed our portfolio of strong brands and strategically expanded across five states on approximately 2,000 acres of owned land and 190 acres of leased land in San Diego.

Maintaining and improving our theme parks, as well as opening new attractions, is critical to remain competitive, grow revenue and increase our guests’ length of stay. During 2019, we plan to introduce an extensive line up of new rides and attractions. Some of the new attractions planned for 2019 include: • Tigris (Busch Gardens Tampa Bay): Florida’s tallest launch coaster is a triple launch steel coaster that will catapult riders through an array of looping twists with forward and backward motion, drops, a 150-foot skyward surge, and an inverted heartline roll, all at more than 60 miles per hour. The queue will include educational content about the plight of tigers in the wild and what conservationists – including the SeaWorld & Busch Gardens Conservation Fund – are doing to save them. • Sesame Street (SeaWorld Orlando): An immersive new land that will feature exciting rides, wet and dry play areas and interactive experiences designed to entertain the entire family including a daily party on Sesame Street and SeaWorld Orlando's first-ever parade. Guests can explore the iconic neighborhood and walk through Abby Cadabby's garden, visit Mr. Hooper's store, stop by Big Bird's nest, sit on the famous 123 stoop and meet everyone’s favorite friends from Sesame Street including Elmo, Cookie Monster and Big Bird. • KareKare Curl (Aquatica Orlando): A first-of-its-kind in Orlando, this family clover-tube ride will send guests soaring on a weightless adventure as they climb a vertical wave wall. • Tidal Twister (SeaWorld San Diego): A first-of-its-kind dueling roller coaster that accelerates riders as they twist and bank just as if they are riding the tide along a tight figure-8 track that includes a dynamic roll at the center. Features its related conservation element, Rising Tide Conservation, with educational content that will focus on the importance of protecting the ocean and coral reefs through sustainable aquaculture programs for marine ornamental fish. • Turtle Reef (SeaWorld San Antonio): A one-of-a-kind interactive sea turtle attraction that will give guests an up-close look at live threatened and endangered sea turtles. Populated with non-releasable sea turtles - turtles that are unable to survive in the wild on their own - the attraction will encourage guests to be more conscious about human impact on the oceans and environment. • Sea Swinger (SeaWorld San Antonio): One of the tallest and fastest swing rides in the entire state of Texas – swinging riders 180-degrees in both directions while twisting them in a circle. • Riptide Rescue (SeaWorld San Antonio): This attraction will provide younger guests and families an opportunity to board a rescue boat and set out on their own sea turtle rescue mission. • Ihu’s Breakaway Falls (Aquatica San Antonio): A one-of-a-kind, multi-drop tower slide, the steepest in Texas where riders will drop feet-first through spiraling tubes until they reach the splash pool finale. • Finnegan’s Flyer (Busch Gardens Williamsburg): As Virginia’s first Screamin’ Swing, Finnegan’s Flyer will take riders up more than 80 feet at speeds reaching 45 miles per hour. • Cutback Water Coaster (Water Country USA): Guests will be able to brave the first Rocket BLAST coaster on the East Coast and Virginia’s first hybrid water coaster which will propel riders through tunnels, up and down steep hills and speed onto the wide-open space of massive saucer-shaped features on over 850 feet of water slide. • Sesame Street Neighborhood (Sesame Place): This iconic street will be updated to reflect the reimagined, vibrant set now seen on Sesame Street with brand-new storefronts including an updated Mr. Hooper’s Store and the iconic 123 stoop. Guests can take a stroll through Abby Cadabby’s Garden and pose for a photo in Big Bird’s Nest. And, introducing the newest (and biggest!) neighbor to Sesame Place – Mr. Snuffleupagus! Guests will be able to meet and take photos with Snuffy and Big Bird throughout the spring and summer at Abby’s Paradise Theater. Maintenance and Inspection Safety is of utmost importance to us. Maintenance at our theme parks is a key component of safety and guest service and includes two areas of focus: (i) facilities and infrastructure and (ii) rides and attractions. Facilities and infrastructure maintenance consists of all functions associated with upkeep, repair, preventative maintenance, code compliance and improvement of theme park infrastructure. This area is staffed with a combination of external contractors/suppliers and our employees. 9 Rides and attractions maintenance represents all functions dedicated to the inspection, upkeep, repair and testing of guest experiences, particularly rides. Rides a nd attractions maintenance is also staffed with a combination of external suppliers, inspectors and our employees, who work to assure that ride experiences are operating within the manufacturer’s criteria and that maintenance is conducted according to inte rnal standards, industry best practice and standards (such as ASTM International, formerly known as the American Society for Testing and Materials), state or jurisdictional requirements, as well as the ride designer or manufacturer’s specifications. All ri de maintenance personnel are trained to perform their duties according to internal training processes, in addition to recognized industry certification programs for maintenance leadership. Every ride at our theme parks is inspected regularly, according to daily, weekly, monthly and annual schedules, by both park maintenance experts and external consultants. Additionally, all rides are inspected daily by maintenance personnel before use by guests to ensure proper and safe operation. A networked enterprise software system is used to plan and track various maintenance activities, in order to schedule and request work, track completion progress and manage costs of parts and materials. Animal Care and Rescue We provide care for one of the largest zoological collections in the world. Our commitment to these animals includes applying world-class standards of care while striving to provide habitats that promote the health of the animals. Our animal care team is among the most experienced and qualified in the world, making SeaWorld a global leader in animal welfare, husbandry, enrichment and veterinary care. The zoological programs of all three SeaWorld parks, Discovery Cove and Busch Gardens Tampa Bay are validated by several professional zoological assessing organizations. Our parks are accredited members of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (“AZA”), one of the foremost professional zoological organizations in the world. In addition, our three SeaWorld parks and Discovery Cove are accredited by the Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums (“AMMPA”), an association specifically focused on the care of marine mammals. SeaWorld’s facilities have also received accreditation from the International Marine Animal Trainers’ Association (“IMATA”), whose Animal Trainer Development Program was developed to recognize those facilities that have exceptional systems for training animal care givers in the science and art of animal training, while utilizing positive reinforcement. And lastly, our parks are Certified Humane by Humane Conservation, an animal welfare certification standard developed by the independent third party organization American Humane. We take a comprehensive approach to ensuring the health and welfare of the animals in our care that focuses on physical, behavioral and population health. Our animal care team includes board-certified veterinarians, technicians and animal care experts, and we have onsite animal hospitals at each SeaWorld park and a guest-facing, state-of-the-art Animal Care Center at our Busch Gardens park in Tampa, Florida. We have also been at the forefront of advancing understanding and best practice-related behavioral health in animals. We are committed to caring for each individual animal, and to being responsible stewards of our animal populations. That includes ensuring that we maintain the genetic diversity needed for healthy and self-sustaining populations. We have invested significantly in developing leading-edge reproductive health expertise, technologies and capabilities. Our focus on population health is also driven by our goal of helping to support, and our participation in, Species Survival Plans, which are programs that are ultimately aimed at preserving species in the wild. We apply high quality and comprehensive animal care standards, and actively work to advance knowledge and improve standards. We do this by contributing to research and sharing our insights with other zoological organizations. For example, our continued work to define the clinically normal, healthy ranges for key measures in marine animals in our parks has helped to establish and refine the standards used by many veterinarians to assess both wild and managed marine species. This ongoing research also includes defining the basic biology and physiology of animals in our collection. The combined results of these continued research efforts have provided and will continue to provide essential information and tools to help formulate plans to protect species in their natural habitats. We are also a leader in animal rescue. Over the last five decades, through December 31, 2018, we have helped more than 34,000 ill, injured, orphaned or abandoned wild animals in need of our expert care. Working in partnership with state, local and federal agencies, our rescue teams are on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. Our commitment to animals also extends beyond our theme parks and throughout the world. We actively participate in species conservation and rescue efforts as discussed in the “— Conservation & Community Relations ” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 10 Our Products and Services Admission Tickets We generate most of our revenue from selling admission to our theme parks. For the year ended December 31, 2018, theme park admissions accounted for approximately 58% of our total revenue. We engage with travel agents, ticket resellers and travel agencies, and directly with our guests through our websites and social media, to promote advanced ticket sales and provide guest convenience and ease of entry. Guests who visit our theme parks have the option of purchasing multiple types of admission tickets, from single and multi-day tickets to season or annual passes. In addition, visitors can purchase vacation packages with preferred hotels, behind-the-scenes tours, specialty dining packages and front of the line “Quick Queue” access to enhance their experience. We also participate in joint programs that are designed to provide visitors to certain markets with flexibility and value in creating their vacation itineraries. We have partnered with several theme parks and attractions to create joint ticket products which allow guests to purchase a ticket providing access to our theme parks as well as other local area attractions. We also partner with independent third parties who sell tickets and/or packages to our theme parks. We actively use pricing and promotions to manage capacity and maximize revenue. We utilize demand-based pricing for select peak time periods at some of our parks, advance purchase discounts to encourage early commitment, and seasonal pricing models to drive demand in non-peak time periods. Theme Park Operations Our theme park operations strive to deliver a high level of safety, security, guest service and cleanliness at our theme parks. The theme park operations team manages the planning and execution of the overall theme park experience on a daily basis, which is comprised of rides, shows and attractions operations, safety, security, environmental, water park and guest arrival services (including parking, tolls, admissions, guest relations, entry and exit). Our theme park operations team identifies and leverages internal best practices across all of our theme parks in order to create a seamless and enjoyable guest experience throughout the entire visit. Culinary Offerings We strive to deliver a variety of high quality, creative and memorable culinary experiences to our guests. Our culinary team focuses on providing creative menu offerings and ways to deliver those offerings that appeal to our diverse guest base. We offer a variety of dining programs that provide quality food and great value to our guests and drive incremental revenues. While our menu offerings have broad appeal, they also cater to guests who desire healthy options and those with special allergy-related needs. Our successful all-day-dining program delivers convenience and value to our guests with numerous restaurant choices for one price. We also offer creative immersive dining experiences that allow guests to dine up-close with our animals and characters. Our commitment to care for the natural world extends to the food that we serve. Some of our menus feature sustainable, organic, seasonal and locally grown ingredients that aim to minimize environmental impacts to animals and their habitats. In addition, through culinary supply chain management initiatives, we are well-positioned to take advantage of changing economic and market conditions. Merchandise We offer guests the opportunity to capture memories through our products and services, including through traditional retail shops, game venues and customized photos and videos. We make a focused effort to leverage the emotional connection of the theme park experiences, capitalize on trends and optimize brand alignment with our merchandise product offerings. In-park games are designed with the goal of creating positive family experiences for guests of every age. Our merchandise teams also focus on making a visit to our theme parks easy, convenient and comfortable. This includes offering lockers or service vehicle rentals such as strollers, electric personal carts and wheelchairs. Consumer Products and Licensing To capitalize on our popular brands, we leverage content through licensing and consumer product arrangements. We developed licensed consumer products to drive consumer sales through retail channels beyond our theme parks and continue to look for this channel to grow. While currently these licensed consumer products do not represent a material percentage of our total revenue, we believe by leveraging our brands and our intellectual property through consumer products, we will create new revenue streams and enhance the value of our brands through greater brand visibility, consumer awareness and increased consumer loyalty. In addition, we have expanded our brand appeal through strategic alliances with well-known external brands, including Sesame Street. Beginning in 2016, we incorporated Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer™ and other well-known characters into five of our park holiday programs under a license agreement with Character Arts, LLC. During 2018, this agreement was extended through January 2024. 11 Group Events and Conventions We host a variety of different group events, meetings and conventions at our theme parks both during the day and at night. Our parks provide a wide variety of unique venues, backdrops and products for groups and include venues such as the icy walls of Antarctica, concert ready stadiums, outdoor pavilions, animal habitats and fully air-conditioned ballrooms. Our special group ticket packages and offerings appeal to specialty markets such as youth, sports, social (i.e. family reunions) and fraternal groups (i.e. scouts), as well as corporate groups seeking to recognize and reward their employees. Park buy-outs allow groups to enjoy exclusive itineraries, including meetings and shows, up-close encounters with animals and behind-the-scenes tours. Our group facilities are available year-round and fully customizable as they can be built around any of the park’s special events, inspirational shows, or one-of-a-kind attractions. Each of our theme parks offers attractive venues, such as SeaWorld Orlando’s Ports of Call, a 70,000 square foot dedicated special events complex and banquet facility that includes a ballroom, a collection of four outdoor pavilions and a courtyard in Orlando, to a fully enclosed and air-conditioned pavilion in Tampa. Corporate Sponsorships and Strategic Alliances We seek to secure long-term corporate sponsorships and strategic alliances with leading companies and brands that share our core values, deliver significant brand value and influence and drive mutual business gains. We identify prospective corporate sponsors based on their industry and industry-leading position, and we select them based on their ability to deliver impactful value to our theme parks and our brands, as well as to consumer products and various entertainment platforms. Our corporate sponsors contribute to us in a multitude of ways, such as through direct marketing, advertising, media exposure and licensing opportunities, as well as through contributions to the non-profit SeaWorld & Busch Gardens Conservation Fund. Also see additional discussion concerning our conservation partnerships, such as Guy Harvey, in the “ —Conservation and Community Relations” section which follows. Our Corporate Culture As a purpose-driven company, our corporate culture is built on our mission to provide experiences that matter for every guest, inspiring them to protect animals and the wild wonders of our world. Our management team and our employees, often referred to as ambassadors, are committed to connecting people to nature and animals and to do so in a socially responsible manner. As guests explore our parks, we educate our ambassadors on ways to create an environment where each guest can explore a diverse range of experiences meant to inspire and motivate them to join us in protecting animals and our planet. Our purpose and focus on creating experiences that matter for our guests are integral to our organization and the cornerstone of our success. Sustainable Operations Environmental conservation is implicit in our purpose. To thrive, animals need vibrant ecosystems and healthy habitats. We understand the adverse effects of human behavior and climate change on ecosystems and the animals who call them home; therefore, we are constantly working to minimize the footprint of our operations. As a part of our commitment to conservation, we have invested in numerous projects to reduce our energy and water use and the amount of waste we generate. For example, in 2018, we implemented an elevated solar panel project at Aquatica San Diego that is expected to generate an estimated 80%-90% of the park’s annual energy use. We believe our parks have some of the most advanced and efficient water purification systems in the world, which provide the optimum environment for our marine life. We leverage this knowledge to reclaim and recycle wastewater for reuse, thereby decreasing our consumption of fresh water. We have also implemented a range of other water conservation efforts across our parks. Many of these incorporate lessons from our facilities in San Diego and San Antonio, which, driven in part by drought conditions, have found innovative opportunities to harvest rainwater, reuse water for cooling buildings and adapt landscaping to require less water. We continually look for new ways to reduce water use in our parks and to support water conservation projects elsewhere. Conservation and Community Relations Our purpose is to inspire people to protect animals and the wild wonders of the world, and a critical way we deliver on this is by providing our guests opportunities to explore and interact with the animals in our parks. Through our up-close animal encounters, educational exhibits and innovative entertainment, we strive to inspire each guest to take action to care for and conserve the natural world. Some of the animals in our care serve as ambassadors for their species through numerous national media and public appearances that educate the public and raise awareness for issues facing wildlife and wild places. We also partner with and support leading research, education and conservation organizations that help protect species of animals at risk in the wild, as well as the habitats that are home to many vulnerable species. 12 We support conservation organizations such as the Killer Whale Research and Conservation Program, in partnership with the National Fish and Wildlife F oundation, to study and protect endangered killer whales in the wild, with a particular focus on the Southern Resident killer whale population found off the coast of Washington. Another example is a partnership with marine wildlife artist and conservationi st Guy Harvey focused on ocean health and the plight of sharks in the wild. We also continue to support the Hubbs-SeaWorld Research Institute, which was started over 50 years ago by one of SeaWorld’s founders and remains a world-renowned scientific researc h organization committed to conserving and renewing marine life to ensure a healthier planet. Alongside our conservation work, we are committed to giving back to the communities in which our theme parks are located. We focus our philanthropic efforts in three areas: animal preservation and stewardship; youth development and education; and community initiatives that address environmental sustainability. We partner with charities across the country whose values and missions are aligned with our own by providing financial support, in-kind resources, strategic guidance and/or hands-on volunteer work. Additionally, our ambassadors are actively involved in volunteer activities, such as beach and river cleanup efforts, fun run charity fundraisers, local food bank distributions and more. Seasonality The theme park industry is seasonal in nature. Historically, we generate the highest revenues in the second and third quarters of each year, in part because seven of our theme parks are only open for a portion of the year. Approximately two-thirds of our attendance and revenues are generated in the second and third quarters of the year and we typically incur a net loss in the first and fourth quarters. The percent mix of revenues by quarter is relatively constant each year, but revenues can shift between the first and second quarters due to the timing of Easter and spring break holidays and between the first and fourth quarters due to the timing of holiday breaks around Christmas and New Year. Even for our five theme parks open year-round, attendance patterns have significant seasonality, driven by holidays, school vacations and weather conditions. Our Guests and Customers Our theme parks are entertainment venues with broad demographic appeal and are located near a number of large metropolitan areas, including 6 of the 10 largest metropolitan areas in the United States and near 6 of the top 10 most visited cities in the United States (Worldatlas, 2018) . Additionally, because our theme parks are divided between regional and destination theme parks, our guests include local visitors, non-local domestic visitors and international visitors. Marketing Our marketing and communications activities continue to be focused around generating profitable attendance, growing in-park per capita spending and building the value of our brands. Intellectual Property Our business is affected by our ability to protect against infringement of our intellectual property, including our trademarks, service marks, domain names, copyrights and other proprietary rights. Important intellectual property includes rights in names, logos, character likenesses, theme park attractions and systems related to the study and care of certain of our animals. In addition, we are party to key license agreements as licensee, including our agreements with ABI and Sesame Workshop (“Sesame”) as discussed below. Busch Gardens License Agreement Our subsidiary, SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment LLC, is a party to a trademark license agreement with ABI, which governs our use of the Busch Gardens name and logo. Under the license agreement, ABI granted to us a perpetual, exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use the Busch Gardens trademark and certain related domain names in connection with the operation, marketing, promotion and advertising of our theme parks, as well as in connection with the production, use, distribution and sale of merchandise sold in connection with such theme parks. The license extends to our Busch Gardens theme parks located in Williamsburg, Virginia and Tampa, Florida, and may also include any amusement or theme park anywhere in the world that we acquire, build or rebrand with the Busch Gardens name in the future, subject to certain conditions. ABI may not assign, transfer or sell the Busch Gardens mark without first granting us a reasonable right of first refusal to purchase such mark. We have agreed to indemnify ABI from and against third party claims and losses arising out of or in connection with the operation of the theme parks and the related marketing or promotion thereof, any merchandise branded with the licensed marks and the infringement of a third party’s intellectual property. We are required to carry certain insurance coverage throughout the term of the license. The license agreement can be terminated by ABI under certain limited circumstances, including in connection with certain types of change of control of SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment LLC. 13 Sesame License Agreement Our wholly-owned subsidiary, SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc. (“SEA”), is a party to a license agreement with Sesame, a New York not-for-profit corporation. The License Agreement extends SEA’s status as Sesame’s exclusive theme park partner in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands (the “Sesame Territory”), with the second Sesame Place ® theme park scheduled to open no later than mid-2021. After the opening of the second Sesame Place, the Company will have the option to build additional Sesame Place theme parks in the Sesame Territory. Under the terms of the license agreement, including the requirement for certain subsequent approvals from Sesame, Sesame granted SEA the right to use the Sesame Street Elements (as defined below) (a) in connection with the design, building, installation, theming, promotion, and operation of SEA’s existing Sesame Place theme park, located in Langhorne, Pennsylvania (the “Langhorne Sesame Place”) and additional Sesame Place theme parks in the United States (collectively, the “Standalone Parks”); (b) in connection with the design, building, installation, theming, promotion, and operation of SEA’s existing Sesame Lands (currently known as Sesame Street ® Bay of Play at SeaWorld San Antonio, Sesame Street Bay of Play at SeaWorld San Diego, Sesame Street Safari of Fun at Busch Gardens Tampa, and Sesame Street Forest of Fun at Busch Gardens Williamsburg) and additional Sesame Lands, including a Sesame Street at SeaWorld Orlando (which the Company plans to open in Spring of 2019) (collectively, the “Sesame Lands”); (c) in connection with the Licensed Products (as defined below); (d) in marketing and promotional activities related to the Standalone Parks and Sesame Lands, including without limitation, marketing, advertising and promotion, character appearances and live presentations (both in park and in off-site promotional activities such as schools, parades, conventions, etc.), and the Licensed Products; and/or (e) to seek and to enter into sponsorship agreements for specific sponsorships of Sesame Street -themed attractions. In addition, SEA has been granted a license to (i) develop and manufacture or have developed and manufactured products that utilize the Sesame Street Elements or to purchase products that utilize the Sesame Street Elements from Sesame’s third party licensees (collectively, the “Licensed Products”), (ii) to market, promote, advertise, distribute and sell the Licensed Products within each of SEA’s theme parks and through online stores on SEA’s websites and targeted primarily to consumers in the United States and (iii) to contract with third party vendors to promote, distribute and sell the Licensed Products within the United States. The term “Sesame Street Elements” means all current and hereafter developed or owned titles, marks, names, characters (including any new Sesame Street characters shown on Sesame Street and owned in whole or controlled by Sesame), images, likenesses, audio, video, audiovisual, logos, themes, symbols, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, visual representations and designs, and other intellectual property (whether in two- or three-dimensional form and including animated and mechanical representations) owned or controlled by Sesame (or its affiliates), and associated with the “ Sesame Street ” television property, whether previously (unless retired) or currently on “ Sesame Street ” or whether hereafter developed or owned and the names and marks “ Sesame Place ” and “ Sesame Land, ” but expressly excluding “Kermit the Frog.” Sesame has reserved rights to build family entertainment centers using the Sesame Street Elements subject to certain territorial restrictions surrounding SEA’s Sesame Place Standalone Parks and Sesame Lands within the Sesame Territory. The license agreement has an initial term through December 31, 2031, with an automatic additional 15 year extension plus a 5 year option added from each new Standalone Park opening. Pursuant to the license agreement, SEA pays a specified annual license fee, as well as a specified royalty based on revenues earned in connection with sales of Licensed Products, all food and beverage items utilizing the licensed elements and any events utilizing such elements if a separate fee is paid for such event. International Development Strategy We believe that in addition to the growth potential that exists domestically, our brands can also have significant appeal in certain international markets. We continue to make progress in our partnership with Miral Asset Management LLC to develop SeaWorld Abu Dhabi, a first-of-its-kind marine life themed park on Yas Island (the “Middle East Project”). As part of this partnership, we are providing certain services pertaining to the planning and design of the Middle East Project, with funding received from our partner in the Middle East expected to offset our internal expenses. SeaWorld Abu Dhabi is expected to be completed by 2022. The Middle East Project is subject to various conditions, including, but not limited to, the parties completing the design development and there is no assurance that the Middle East Project will be completed or advance to the next stage. In March 2017, we entered into a Park Exclusivity and Concept Design Agreement (the “ECDA”) and a Center Concept & Preliminary Design Support Agreement (the “CDSA”) with an affiliate of Zhonghong Zhuoye Group Co., Ltd., (“ZHG Group”) to provide design, support and advisory services for various potential projects and granting exclusive rights in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau (the “Territory”). See Note 17–Related Party Transactions to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. For a discussion of certain risks associated with our international development strategy, including the Middle East Project, see the “ Risk Factors ” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “ Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry—We may not realize the benefits of developments, restructurings, acquisitions or other strategic initiatives .” 14 Our Industry We believe that the theme park industry is an attractive sector characterized by a proven business model that generates significant cash flow and has avenues for growth. Theme parks offer a strong consumer value proposition, particularly when compared to other forms of out-of-home entertainment such as concerts, sporting events, cruises and movies. As a result, theme parks attract a broad range of guests and generally exhibit strong operating margin across regions, operators, park types and macroeconomic conditions. Competition Our theme parks and other product and entertainment offerings compete directly for discretionary spending with other destination and regional theme parks and water and amusement parks and indirectly with other types of recreational facilities and forms of entertainment, including movies, home entertainment options, sports attractions, restaurants and vacation travel. Principal direct competitors of our theme parks include theme parks operated by The Walt Disney Company, Universal Parks and Resorts, Six Flags Entertainment Corporation, Cedar Fair, L.P., Merlin Entertainments plc and Hershey Entertainment and Resorts Company. Our highly differentiated products provide a value proposition and a complementary experience to those offered by fantasy-themed Disney and Universal parks. In addition, we benefit from the significant capital investments made in developing the tourism industry in the Orlando area. The Orlando theme park market is extremely competitive, with a high concentration of theme parks operated by several companies. Competition is based on multiple factors including location, price, the originality and perceived quality of the rides and attractions, the atmosphere and cleanliness of the theme park, the quality of food and entertainment, weather conditions, ease of travel to the theme park (including direct flights by major airlines), and availability and cost of transportation to a theme park. We believe we can compete effectively, due to our strong brand recognition, unique and extensive zoological collection, targeted capital investments and valuable real estate. Additionally, we believe that our theme parks feature a sufficient quality and variety of rides and attractions, educational and interactive experiences, merchandise locations, restaurants and family orientation to make them highly competitive with other destination and regional theme parks, as well as other forms of entertainment. Employees As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 4,700 full-time employees and approximately 12,000 part-time employees. During our peak operating season in 2018, we employed approximately 4,100 additional seasonal employees, many of whom are high school and college students. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our employee relations to be good. Regulatory Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances including, but not limited to, those regulating the environment, display, possession and care of our animals, amusement park rides, building and construction, health and safety, labor and employment, workplace safety, zoning and land use and alcoholic beverage and food service. Key statutes and treaties relating to the display, possession and care of our zoological collection include the Endangered Species Act, Marine Mammal Protection Act, Animal Welfare Act, Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species and Fauna Protection Act and the Lacey Act. We must also comply with the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, Wild Bird Conservation Act and National Environmental Policy Act, among other laws and regulations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable laws, regulations and ordinances; however, such requirements may change over time, and there can be no assurance that new requirements, changes in enforcement policies or newly discovered conditions relating to our properties or operations will not require significant expenditures in the future. Recent Regulatory Developments The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”) released a proposed rule on February 3, 2016 to amend the Animal Welfare Act regulations concerning the humane handling, care and treatment of marine mammals in captivity (the “Proposed APHIS Regulations”). The Proposed APHIS Regulations were subject to public comment which ended on May 4, 2016. We submitted a comment letter to APHIS on the final date for comments, expressing our views on the Proposed APHIS Regulations. The full impact of the Proposed APHIS Regulations on our business will not be known until the Proposed APHIS Regulations are finalized. On November 16, 2018, the Federal Register published the latest Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions. No proposed regulatory actions were listed for APHIS indicating that the agency does not plan any further action at this time on the matter. For a discussion of certain risks associated with federal and state regulations governing the treatment of animals, see the “ Risk Factors ” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “ Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry—We are subject to complex federal and state regulations governing the treatment of animals, which can change, and to claims and lawsuits by activist groups before government regulators and in the courts. ” 15 Insurance We maintain insurance of the type and in the amounts that we believe to be commercially reasonable for businesses in our industry. We maintain primary and excess casualty coverage of up to $125.0 million. As part of this coverage, we retain deductible/self-insured retention exposures consistent with our normal expected losses related to general liability claims, automobile liability and workers compensation claims. We maintain employers’ liability and all coverage required by law in the states in which we operate. Defense costs are included in the insurance coverage we obtain against losses in these areas. Based upon our historical experience of reported claims and an estimate for incurred-but-not-reported claims, we accrue a liability for our deductible/self-insured retention contingencies regarding general liability, automobile liability and workers compensation exposures. We maintain additional forms of special casualty coverage appropriate for businesses in our industry. We also maintain commercial property coverage against fire, natural perils, so-called “extended coverage” perils such as civil commotion, business interruption and terrorism exposures for protection of our real and personal properties (other than land). We generally renegotiate our insurance policies on an annual basis. We cannot predict the amounts of premium cost that we may be required to pay for future insurance coverage, the level of any deductibles/self-insured retentions we may retain applicable thereto, the level of aggregate excess coverage available, the availability of coverage for special or specific risks or whether the amount of insurance will be sufficient to cover all actual perils that may occur. Corporate History Our legacy started in 1959 with the opening of our first Busch Gardens theme park in Tampa, Florida. Since then, we have developed our portfolio of strong brands and strategically expanded across five states. On December 1, 2009, investment funds affiliated with The Blackstone Group L.P. and certain co-investors, through SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc. (“SEA”), acquired 100% of the equity interests of Sea World LLC (f/k/a Sea World, Inc.) and SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment LLC (f/k/a Busch Entertainment Corporation) from certain subsidiaries of Anheuser-Busch Companies, Inc. We refer to this acquisition and related financing transactions as the “2009 Transactions.” SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware on October 2, 2009 in connection with the 2009 Transactions and changed its name from SW Holdco, Inc. to SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. in December 2012. We completed our initial public offering (the “IPO”) in April 2013 and our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “SEAS”. On May 8, 2017, an affiliate of ZHG Group, Sun Wise (UK) Co., LTD (“ZHG”) acquired approximately 21% of the then outstanding shares of common stock of the Company from certain affiliates of Blackstone (the “Seller”), pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement between ZHG and the Seller (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”). See further discussion in Note 1–Description of the Business and Note 17–Related-Party Transactions to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of December 31, 2018, ZHG owned approximately 23.1% and Hill Path owned approximately 16.6% of our total outstanding common stock.

Ri sk Factors The following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating us and this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain statements in “Risk Factors” are forward-looking statements. See “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” elsewhere in this report: Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry We are subject to complex federal and state regulations governing the treatment of animals, which can change, and to claims and lawsuits by activist groups before government regulators and in the courts. We operate in a complex and evolving regulatory environment and are subject to various federal and state statutes and regulations and international treaties implemented by federal law. The states in which we operate also regulate zoological activity involving the import and export of exotic and native wildlife, endangered and/or otherwise protected species, zoological display and anti-cruelty statutes. We incur significant compliance costs in connection with these regulations and violation of such regulations could subject us to fines and penalties and result in the loss of our licenses and permits, which, if occurred, could impact our ability to display certain animals. Future amendments to existing statutes, regulations and treaties or new statutes, regulations and treaties or lawsuits against the Company, government agencies or other third parties in the zoological industry may potentially restrict our ability to maintain our animals, or to acquire new ones to supplement or sustain our breeding programs or otherwise adversely affect our business. In 2017, the Orca Responsibility and Care Advancement Act (the “ORCA Act”) was reintroduced. If enacted, this reintroduced bill would amend the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 and the Animal Welfare Act to prohibit the breeding, the taking (wild capture), and the import or export of orcas for the purposes of public display. In addition, the reintroduced bill would prohibit the transport of orcas from one park to another but does allow for transport to a “marine mammal sanctuary” and attempts to officially define the term “sanctuary” in law. In 2016, a California lawmaker reintroduced the California Orca Protection Act. On August 26, 2016, this bill was enacted into law and (i) codified the end of captive breeding programs and the export and import of genetic materials for orcas in California, (ii) prohibits the import or export of new orcas into or existing orcas out of California, (iii) permits the transfer of orcas currently in California among existing SeaWorld facilities and (iv) requires educational presentations of orcas in California. We introduced new orca programs in our San Diego park in 2017 which are consistent with these standards. In 2018, a Florida State lawmaker filed a Florida Orca Protection bill, with similar language to the California legislation, which would have similar implications to the California legislation; however, we are developing new orca programs at all SeaWorld parks which are consistent with the proposed standards. In 2019, a California lawmaker introduced an amendment to the California Orca Protection Act which could expand the act to cover all whales and dolphin species. If enacted as proposed, the California Orca Protection Act could require changes to our business and could result in material costs and negatively impact our results of operations. In 2015 legislation was proposed that would have directed the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”) to issue updated regulations for the display of marine mammals in domestic zoos and aquaria within six months of enactment. This proposed rule would have affected sections in the regulations for the protection of all marine mammals in the United States relating to human marine mammal interactive programs, space requirements, water quality, indoor facilities, outdoor facilities, implementation dates, and variances. The full impact of the Proposed APHIS Regulations on our business is not determinable until the Proposed APHIS Regulations are finalized. If enacted, the Proposed APHIS Regulations could increase our regulatory compliance burdens and costs, impact the way and manner the Company’s marine mammals are displayed and require additional management attention and investments to come into compliance. In light of the uncertain legal, legislative and regulatory environment and evolving public sentiment, we continue to evaluate a broad spectrum of enhancements, modifications and alternatives with respect to the display, husbandry and breeding practices, handling and care, and study and research of our orcas and other marine animals. Any decisions regarding such matters are subject to consideration and assessment of various factors including, but not limited to, the health and welfare of the animals, guest sentiment, market conditions, anticipated impact on our business, regulatory environment, legal proceedings, input from our shareholders and conservation partners, and other factors. If we were to pursue or be required to pursue any alternative approaches with respect to the display, husbandry and breeding practices, handling and care, or study and research of our orcas or other animals in our zoological collection, the full impact of such alternatives on our business will not be known until such alternatives are finalized. In the meantime, we continue to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate the impact of and ensure compliance with the applicable regulatory and other developments. 17 We are subject to scrutiny by activist and other third-party groups and/or media who can pressure governmental agencies, vendors, partners, and/or regulators, brin g action in the courts or create negative publicity about us. From time to time, animal activist and other third-party groups may make claims before government agencies, bring lawsuits against us, and/or attempt to generate negative publicity associated with our business. Such activities sometimes are based on allegations that we do not properly care for some of our animals. On other occasions, such activities are specifically designed to change existing law or enact new law in order to impede our ability to retain, exhibit, acquire or breed animals. While we seek to structure our operations to comply with all applicable federal and state laws and vigorously defend ourselves when sued, there are no assurances as to the outcome of future claims and lawsuits that could be brought against us, governmental agencies or other third parties in the zoological industry. Even if not successful, these lawsuits can require deployment of Company resources. Negative publicity created by activists or in the media could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. At times, activists and other third-party groups have also attempted to generate negative publicity related to our relationships with our business partners, such as corporate sponsors, promotional partners, vendors, ticket resellers and others. These activities have at times led relationships with some ticket resellers to be terminated. Although sales from any particular ticket reseller may not constitute a significant portion of our ticket sales, if a relationship with a ticket reseller is terminated, we will attempt to find alternative distribution channels. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful or that those channels will be as successful or not have additional costs. If we are unable to find cost effective alternative distribution channels, the loss of multiple ticket resellers could have a negative impact on our results of operations. Various factors beyond our control could adversely affect attendance and guest spending patterns at our theme parks. Various factors beyond our control could adversely affect attendance and guest spending patterns at our theme parks. These factors could also affect our suppliers, vendors, insurance carriers and other contractual counterparties. Such factors include but are not limited to: • war, terrorist activities or threats and heightened travel security measures instituted in response to these events; • outbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases or consumers’ concerns relating to potential exposure to travel-related health concerns such as pandemics and epidemics such as Ebola, Zika, Influenza H1N1, avian bird flu, SARS and MERS; • natural disasters, such as hurricanes, fires, earthquakes, tsunamis, tornados, floods and volcanic eruptions and man-made disasters such as oil spills, which may deter travelers from scheduling vacations or cause them to cancel travel or vacation plans; • bad weather and even forecasts of bad weather, including abnormally hot, cold and/or wet weather, particularly during weekends, holidays or other peak periods; • changes in the desirability of particular locations or travel patterns of both our domestic and international guests; • fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; • low consumer confidence; • oil prices and travel costs and the financial condition of the airline, automotive and other transportation-related industries, any travel-related disruptions or incidents and their impact on travel or decrease transportation options to cities where we have parks; • actions or statements by U.S. and foreign governmental officials, including the U.S. President and administration officials, related to travel and corporate travel-related activities (including changes to the U.S. visa rules) and the resulting public perception of such travel and activities; and • interruption of public or private utility services to our theme parks. Any one or more of these factors could adversely affect attendance, revenue and per capita spending at our theme parks, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, in 2017, we experienced a decline in international attendance from certain markets including the United Kingdom. We believe these declines were due partly to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against a variety of foreign currencies. The June 2016 announcement of the Referendum of the United Kingdom’s Membership of the European Union (referred to as Brexit) introduced additional volatility and uncertainty in global stock markets and currency exchange rates which we believe may have also had an impact on our international attendance from the United Kingdom. Historically, attendance from the United Kingdom represented approximately 5% of our total annual attendance. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates impact our business. A strong dollar increases the cost for international tourists and could impact their spending. In addition, demand for our parks is highly dependent on the general environment for travel and tourism, which can be significantly adversely affected by extreme weather events. Any of such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. For example, attendance at our parks in 2017 was negatively impacted by Hurricane Irma, which caused park closures in Tampa and Orlando, and, to a lesser extent, Hurricane Harvey, which caused park closures and travel disruptions in Texas, as well as weather impacts in Virginia. 18 Incidents or adverse publicity concerni ng our theme parks or the theme park industry generally could harm our brands or reputation as well as negatively impact our revenues and profitability. Our brands and our reputation are among our most important assets. Our ability to attract and retain guests depends, in part, upon the external perceptions of the Company, the quality of our theme parks and services and our corporate and management integrity. The operation of theme parks involves the risk of accidents, illnesses, environmental incidents and other incidents which may negatively affect the perception of guest and employee safety, health, security and guest satisfaction and which could negatively impact our brands or reputation and our business and results of operations. An accident or an injury at any of our theme parks or at theme parks operated by competitors, particularly an accident or an injury involving the safety of guests and employees, that receives media attention, is the topic of a book, film, documentary or is otherwise the subject of public discussions, may harm our brands or reputation, cause a loss of consumer confidence in the Company, reduce attendance at our theme parks and negatively impact our results of operations. Such incidents have occurred in the past and may occur in the future. In addition, other types of adverse publicity concerning our business or the theme park industry generally could harm our brands, reputation and results of operations. The considerable expansion in the use of social media over recent years has compounded the impact of negative publicity. There has been and may continue to be perception issues and negative media attention that create a barrier to attendance at our parks which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We could be adversely affected by a decline in discretionary consumer spending or consumer confidence. Our success depends to a significant extent on discretionary consumer spending, which is heavily influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income. In the past, severe economic downturns, coupled with high volatility and uncertainty as to the future global economic landscape, have had an adverse effect on consumers’ discretionary income and consumer confidence. Volatile, negative or uncertain economic conditions and recessionary periods may adversely impact attendance figures, the frequency with which guests choose to visit our theme parks and guest spending patterns at our theme parks. The actual or perceived weakness in the economy could also lead to decreased spending by our guests. For example, in 2009 and 2010, we experienced a decline in attendance as a result of the global economic crisis, which in turn adversely affected our revenue and profitability. Both attendance and total revenue per capita spending at our theme parks are key drivers of our revenue and profitability, and reductions in either can materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. A significant portion of our revenues are generated in the States of Florida, California and Virginia and in the Orlando market. Any risks affecting such markets, such as natural disasters and travel-related disruptions or incidents, may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Approximately 57%, 17% and 13% of our revenues in 2018 were generated in the States of Florida, California and Virginia, respectively. In addition, our revenues and results of operations depend significantly on the results of our Orlando theme parks. The Orlando theme park market is extremely competitive, with a high concentration of theme parks operated by several companies. Any risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, such as the occurrence of natural disasters and travel-related disruptions or incidents, affecting the States of Florida, California and Virginia generally or our Orlando theme parks in particular may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, especially if they have the effect of decreasing attendance at our theme parks or, in extreme cases, cause us to close any of our theme parks for any period of time. For example, in 2016, Florida was impacted by Tropical Storm Colin and both Florida and Virginia were impacted by Hurricanes Hermine and Matthew, which caused physical damage and power outages in various parts of Florida and Virginia. Although we attempted to manage our exposure to such events by implementing our hurricane preparedness plan, our theme parks located in Orlando and Tampa, Florida and in Williamsburg, Virginia experienced closures as a result of these storms. In addition, attendance at our parks in 2017 was negatively impacted by Hurricane Irma, which caused park closures in Tampa and Orlando, and, to a lesser extent, Hurricane Harvey, which caused park closures and travel disruptions in Texas, as well as weather impacts in Virginia. Our operating results are subject to seasonal fluctuations. We have historically experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in our annual theme park attendance and revenue, which are typically higher in our second and third quarters, partly because seven of our theme parks are only open for a portion of the year. Approximately two-thirds of our attendance and revenues are generated in the second and third quarters of the year and we typically incur a net loss in the first and fourth quarters. In addition, school vacations and school start dates also cause fluctuations in our quarterly theme park attendance and revenue. Furthermore, the operating season at some of our theme parks, including SeaWorld San Antonio, Aquatica San Antonio, Adventure Island, Aquatica San Diego, Busch Gardens Williamsburg, Water Country USA and Sesame Place, is of limited duration. In addition, most of our expenses for maintenance and costs of adding new attractions at our seasonal theme parks are incurred when the operating season is over, which may increase the need for borrowing to fund such expenses during such periods. 19 When conditions or events described in this section occur during the operating season, particularly during the second and third quarters, there is only a limited period of time during which the impact of those c onditions or events can be mitigated. Accordingly, such conditions or events may have a disproportionately adverse effect on our revenues and cash flow. Because we operate in a highly competitive industry, our revenues, profits or market share could be harmed if we are unable to compete effectively. The entertainment industry, and the theme park industry in particular, is highly competitive. Our theme parks compete with other theme, water and amusement parks and with other types of recreational facilities and forms of entertainment, including movies, home entertainment options, sports attractions, restaurants and vacation travel. Principal direct competitors of our theme parks include theme parks operated by The Walt Disney Company, Universal Parks and Resorts, Six Flags Entertainment Corporation, Cedar Fair, L.P., Merlin Entertainments plc, and Hershey Entertainment and Resorts Company. The principal competitive factors of a theme park include location, price, originality and perceived quality of the rides and attractions, the atmosphere and cleanliness of the theme park, the quality of its food and entertainment, weather conditions, ease of travel to the theme park (including direct flights by major airlines), and availability and cost of transportation to a theme park. Certain of our direct competitors have substantially greater financial resources than we do, and they may be able to adapt more quickly to changes in guest preferences or devote greater resources to promotion of their offerings and attractions than us. Our competitors may be able to attract guests to their theme parks in lieu of our own through the development or acquisition of new rides, attractions or shows that are perceived by guests to be of a higher quality and entertainment value. As a result, we may not be able to compete successfully against such competitors. For example, in 2014, we experienced negative attendance trends, primarily at our destination parks in Florida, which we believe was due in part to significant new attraction offerings at competitor destination parks, along with a delay in the scheduled opening of one of our new rides at our Busch Gardens Tampa park. Featuring animals at our theme parks involves risks. Our theme parks feature numerous displays and interactions that include animals. All animal enterprises involve some degree of risk. All animal interactions by our employees and our guests in attractions in our theme parks, where offered, involves risk. While we maintain strict safety procedures for the protection of our employees and guests, injuries or death, while rare, have occurred in the past. For example, in February 2010, a trainer was killed while engaged in an interaction with an orca. Following this incident, we were subject to an inspection by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), which resulted in citations concerning alleged violations of the Occupational Safety and Health Act and certain regulations thereunder. In connection with this incident, we reviewed and revised our safety protocols and made certain safety-related facility enhancements such as revising training protocols used in show performances. This incident has also been and continues to be the subject of significant media attention, including extensive television and newspaper coverage, a documentary and a book, as well as discussions in social media. This incident and similar events that may occur in the future may harm our reputation, reduce attendance and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We maintain insurance of the type and in amounts that we believe are commercially reasonable and that are available to animal enterprise related businesses in the theme park industry. We cannot predict the level of the premiums that we may be required to pay for subsequent insurance coverage, the level of any self-insurance retention applicable thereto, the level of aggregate coverage available, or the availability of coverage for specific risks. Animals in our care are important to our theme parks, and they could be exposed to infectious diseases. Many of our theme parks are distinguished from those of our competitors in that we offer guest interactions with animals. Individual animals, specific species of animals or groups of animals in our zoological collection could be exposed to infectious diseases. While we have never had any such experiences, an outbreak of an infectious disease among any animals in our theme parks or the public’s perception that a certain disease could be harmful to human health may materially adversely affect our zoological collection, our business, financial condition and results of operations. The high fixed cost structure of theme park operations can result in significantly lower margins if revenues decline. A large portion of our expenses is relatively fixed because the costs for employees, maintenance, animal care, utilities, advertising and insurance do not vary significantly with attendance. These fixed costs may increase at a greater rate than our revenues and may not be able to be reduced at the same rate as declining revenues. If cost-cutting efforts are insufficient to offset declines in revenues or are impracticable, we could experience a material decline in margins, revenues, profitability and reduced or negative cash flows. Such effects can be especially pronounced during periods of economic contraction or slow economic growth. 20 Changes in consumer tastes and preferences for entertainment and consumer products could reduce demand fo r our entertainment offerings and products and adversely affect the profitability of our business. The success of our business depends on our ability to consistently provide, maintain and expand theme park attractions as well as create online material and consumer products that meet changing consumer preferences . In addition, consumers from outside the United States constitute an important portion of our theme park attendance, and our success depends in part on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to tastes and preferences of this consumer group. If our entertainment offerings and products do not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or if consumer preferences change, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Cyber security risks and the failure to maintain the integrity of internal or guest data could result in damages to our reputation, the disruption of operations and/or subject us to costs, fines or lawsuits. We collect internal and customer data for business purposes. This data may include Personal Identifiable information held in our various information technology systems which collect, process, summarize and report such data. We also maintain personally identifiable information about our employees. The integrity and protection of our customer, employee and company data is critical to our business. Our guests and employees have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information. The regulatory environment, as well as the requirements imposed on us by the credit card industry, governing information, security and privacy laws is increasingly demanding and continues to evolve. Maintaining compliance with applicable security and privacy regulations may increase our operating costs and/or adversely impact our ability to market our theme parks, products and services to our guests. We also rely on accounting, financial and operational management information technology systems to conduct our operations. If these information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. We face various security threats, including cyber security attacks on our data infrastructure. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate these threats, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent penetrations or disruptions to our systems. Furthermore, a penetrated or compromised data system or the intentional, inadvertent or negligent release or disclosure of data could result in theft, loss, fraudulent or unlawful use of guest, employee or company data which could harm our reputation or result in remedial and other costs, fines or lawsuits and require significant management attention and resources to be spent. In addition, our insurance coverage and indemnification arrangements that we enter into, if any, may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to cyber security attacks or disruptions resulting from such events. To date, cyber security attacks directed at us have not had a material impact on our financial results. Due to the evolving nature of security threats, however, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted. Increased labor costs and employee health and welfare benefits may negatively impact our operations. Labor is a primary component in the cost of operating our business. We devote significant resources to recruiting and training our employees. Increased labor costs due to competition, increased minimum wage or employee benefit costs or otherwise, would adversely impact our operating expenses. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 and the amendments thereto contain provisions that have impacted our healthcare costs. Any future amendments could significantly increase our compensation costs, which would reduce our net income and adversely affect our cash flows. In 2016, San Diego passed legislation increasing its minimum wage and beginning in January 2019, the San Diego minimum wage as well as the State of California minimum wage will change based on the consumer price index. Virginia has also proposed legislation that would take effect July 1, 2019 which would increase its minimum wage over a three year period to $15 an hour by 2021. In addition, a number of companies from whom we compete for talent have publicly announced wage increases. Increases to the minimum wage in locations where we do business, wages of companies from whom we compete for talent and/or increased benefit costs will negatively impact our operating expenses. Our growth strategy may not achieve the anticipated results. Our future success will depend on our ability to grow our business, including through capital investments to improve existing and develop new theme parks, rides, attractions and shows, as well as in-park product offerings and product offerings outside of our theme parks. Our growth and innovation strategies require significant commitments of management resources and capital investments and may not grow our revenues at the rate we expect or at all. As a result, we may not be able to recover the costs incurred in developing our new projects and initiatives or to realize their intended or projected benefits, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 21 We may not be able to fund theme park c apital expenditures and investment in future attractions and projects. A principal competitive factor for a theme park is the originality and perceived quality of its rides and attractions. We need to make continued capital investments through maintenance and the regular addition of new rides and attractions. Our ability to fund capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and to raise capital from third parties. We cannot assure you that our operations will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to fund such costs, or that we will be able to obtain sufficient financing on adequate terms, or at all, which could cause us to delay or abandon certain projects or plans. Adverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved in the normal course of our business could reduce our profits or limit our ability to operate our business. We are subject to allegations, claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business, which may include claims by third parties, including guests who visit our theme parks, our employees or regulators. We are currently subject to securities litigation. The Company is also subject to audits, inspections and investigations by, or receives requests for information from, various federal and state regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”), the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“Cal-OSHA”), state departments of labor, the Florida Fish & Wildlife Commission (“FWC”), the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”), the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS” ), the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). From time to time, various parties may also bring lawsuits against the Company. For example, in June 2017, the Company received a subpoena in connection with an investigation by the DOJ concerning certain disclosures and public statements made by the Company and certain individuals on or before August 2014, and trading in the Company’s securities. The Company also had received subpoenas from the staff of the SEC in connection with these matters. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company reached a settlement with the SEC. In connection with the settlement, without admitting or denying the substantive allegations in the SEC’s complaint, the Company agreed to the entry of a final judgment ordering the Company to pay a civil penalty of $4.0 million and enjoining the Company from violation of certain provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and certain rules thereunder. The settlement was approved by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on September 24, 2018. On December 11, 2018, the DOJ informed us that it does not intend to take any action against the Company or any individuals in connection with its investigation. We consider the DOJ matter concluded. We discuss securities litigation and other litigation to which we are subject in greater detail in “ Item 3. Legal Proceedings ” and Note 15–Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The outcome of many of these proceedings cannot be predicted. If any proceedings, audits, inspections or investigations were to be determined adversely against us or resulted in legal actions, claims, regulatory proceedings, enforcement actions, or judgments, fines, or settlements involving a payment of material sums of money, or if injunctive relief were issued against us, our business, financial cond ition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Even the successful defense of legal proceedings may cause us to incur substantial legal costs and may divert management’s attention and resources. Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could adversely affect our business. Our intellectual property, including our trademarks, service marks, domain names, copyrights, patent and other proprietary rights, constitutes a significant part of the value of the Company. To protect our intellectual property rights, we rely upon a combination of trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret and unfair competition laws of the United States and other countries, as well as contract provisions and third-party policies and procedures governing internet/domain name registrations. However, there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful in any given case, particularly in those countries where the laws do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. We may be unable to prevent the misappropriation, infringement or violation of our intellectual property rights, breaching any contractual obligations to us, or independently developing intellectual property that is similar to ours, any of which could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed, adversely affect our revenues or otherwise harm our business. We have obtained and applied for numerous U.S. and foreign trademark and service mark registrations and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks and service marks or other intellectual property, as appropriate. We cannot guarantee that any of our pending applications will be approved by the applicable governmental authorities. Moreover, even if the applications are approved, third parties may seek to oppose or otherwise challenge these registrations. A failure to obtain registrations for our intellectual property in the United States and other countries could limit our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and impede our marketing efforts in those jurisdictions. We are actively engaged in enforcement and other activities to protect our intellectual property rights. If it became necessary for us to resort to litigation to protect these rights, any proceedings could be burdensome, costly and divert the attention of our personnel, and we may not prevail. In addition, any repeal or weakening of laws or enforcement in the United States or internationally intended to protect intellectual property rights could make it more difficult for us to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, negatively impacting their value and increasing the cost of enforcing our rights. 22 We may be subject to claims for infringing the intellectual property rights of others, which could be costly and result in the loss of significant intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that we do not and will not infringe the intellectual property rights of others. We have been in the past, and may be in the future, subject to litigation and other claims in the ordinary course of our business based on allegations of infringement or other violations of the intellectual property rights of others. Regardless of their merits, intellectual property claims can divert the efforts of our personnel and are often time-consuming and expensive to litigate or settle. In addition, to the extent claims against us are successful, we may have to pay substantial money damages or discontinue, modify or rename certain products or services that are found to be in violation of another party’s rights. We may have to seek a license (if available on acceptable terms, or at all) to continue offering products and services, which may significantly increase our operating expenses. If we lose licenses and permits required to exhibit animals and/or violate laws and regulations, our business will be adversely affected. We are required to hold government licenses and permits, some of which are subject to yearly or periodic renewal, for purposes of possessing, exhibiting and maintaining animals. Although our theme parks’ licenses and permits have always been renewed in the past, in the event that any of our licenses or permits are not renewed or any of our licenses or permits are revoked, portions of the affected theme park might not be able to remain open for purpose of displaying or retaining the animals covered by such license or permit. Such an outcome could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we are subject to periodic inspections by federal and state agencies and the subsequent issuance of inspection reports. While we believe that we comply with, or exceed, requisite care and maintenance standards that apply to our animals, government inspectors can cite us for alleged statutory or regulatory violations. In unusual instances when we are cited for an alleged deficiency, we are most often given the opportunity to correct any purported deficiencies without penalty. It is possible, however, that in some cases a federal or state regulator could seek to impose monetary fines on us. In the past, when we have been subjected to governmental claims for fines, the amounts involved were not material to our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, while highly unlikely, we cannot predict whether any future fines that regulators might seek to impose would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Moreover, many of the statutes under which we operate allow for the imposition of criminal sanctions. While neither of the foregoing situations are likely to occur, either could negatively affect the business, financial condition or results of operations at our theme parks. If we lose key personnel, our business may be adversely affected. Our success depends in part upon a number of key employees, including members of our senior management team who have extensive experience in the industry. We may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employees, particularly if we do not offer employment terms that are competitive with the rest of the market. Failure to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified employees, or failure to develop and implement a viable succession plan, could adversely affect our business and our future success. The Board recently appointed Gustavo (Gus) Antorcha as Chief Executive Officer and member of the Board of Directors. Changes in the Company’s management team and to the Board of Directors, may be disruptive to, or cause uncertainty in, the Company’s business, and any additional changes to the management team or the Board of Directors could have a negative impact on the Company’s ability to manage and grow its business effectively. In addition, if the Company is not effective in its succession planning, it may have a negative impact on the Company’s ability to successfully recruit for its management team. Any such disruption or uncertainty or difficulty in efficiently and effectively filling key management roles could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, results of operations and/or the price of the Company’s common stock. Unionization activities or labor disputes may disrupt our operations and affect our profitability. Although none of our employees are currently covered under collective bargaining agreements, we cannot guarantee that our employees will not elect to be represented by labor unions in the future. If some or all of our employees were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were significantly different from our current compensation arrangements, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, a labor dispute involving some or all of our employees may disrupt our operations and reduce our revenues, and resolution of disputes may increase our costs. Although we maintain binding policies that require employees to submit to a mandatory alternative dispute resolution procedure in lieu of other remedies, as employers, we may be subject to various employment-related claims, such as individual or class actions or government enforcement actions relating to alleged employment discrimination, employee classification and related withholding, wage-hour, labor standards or healthcare and benefit issues. Such actions, if brought against us and successful in whole or in part, may affect our ability to compete or materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 23 Our business depends on our ability to meet our workforce needs. Our success depends on our ability to attract, train, motivate and retain qualified employees to keep pace with our needs, including employees with certain specialized skills in the field of animal training and care. If we are unable to do so, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected. In addition, we employ a significant seasonal workforce. We recruit year-round to fill thousands of seasonal staffing positions each season and work to manage seasonal wages and the timing of the hiring process to ensure the appropriate workforce is in place. There is no assurance that we will be able to recruit and hire adequate seasonal personnel as the business requires or that we will not experience material increases in the cost of securing our seasonal workforce in the future. Increased seasonal wages or an inadequate workforce could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. See also, “ Increased labor costs and employee health and welfare benefits may negatively impact our operations.” We may not realize the benefits of developments, restructurings, acquisitions or other strategic initiatives. Our business strategy may include selective expansion, both domestically and internationally, through acquisitions of assets or other strategic initiatives, such as joint ventures, that allow us to profitably expand our business and leverage our brands. For example, in 2016 we announced our partnership with Miral Asset Management LLC to develop SeaWorld Abu Dhabi, a first-of-its-kind marine life themed park on Yas Island. In addition, on March 24, 2017, we entered into a Park Exclusivity and Concept Design Agreement (“ECDA”) and a Center Concept & Preliminary Design Support Agreement (“CDSA”) with an affiliate of ZHG Group to provide design, support and advisory services for various potential projects and granting exclusive rights in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau. There is no assurance that the Miral partnership or any other expansion effort for our business, including without limitation the ECDA and the CDSA, will be successful. Any international transactions and partnerships are subject to additional risks, including foreign and U.S. regulations on the import and export of animals, the impact of economic fluctuations in economies outside of the United States, difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations due to distance, language and cultural differences, as well as political instability and lesser degree of legal protection in certain jurisdictions, currency exchange fluctuations and potentially adverse tax consequences of overseas operations. In addition, the success of any acquisition depends on effective integration of acquired businesses and assets into our operations, which is subject to risks and uncertainties, including realization of anticipated synergies and cost savings, the ability to retain and attract personnel, the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns, and undisclosed or potential legal liabilities of acquired businesses or assets. The Company has a strategic plan to grow revenue and Adjusted EBITDA and, from time to time, identifies and executes on cost reduction opportunities. There can be no assurances that we will be able to achieve and/or sustain the cost savings, grow our business or realize or sustain the operational efficiencies. See further discussion under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations―Principal Factors and Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations―Costs and Expenses ” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If we are unable to maintain certain commercial licenses, our business, reputation and brand could be adversely affected. We rely on a license from Sesame to use the Sesame Place trade name and trademark and certain other intellectual property rights, including titles, marks, characters, logos and designs from the Sesame Street television series within our Sesame Place theme park located in Langhorne, Pennsylvania (the “Langhorne Sesame Place”) and any additional future Sesame Place theme parks in the United States (collectively, the “Standalone Parks”) and with respect to Sesame Street themed areas within certain areas of some of our other theme parks, as well as in connection with the sales of certain Sesame Street themed products. The License Agreement with Sesame Workshop (the “Sesame License Agreement”) has an initial term through December 31, 2031, with an automatic additional 15-year extension plus a 5-year option added from each new Standalone Park opening. Our use of these intellectual property rights is subject to the approval of Sesame and the parties have certain termination rights under the Sesame License Agreement, including without limitation Sesame’s right to terminate the Sesame License Agreement in whole or in part under certain limited circumstances, including a change of control of the Company (or of SeaWorld Parks and Entertainment, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company), the Company’s bankruptcy or uncured breach of the Sesame License Agreement, or the termination of the Sesame License Agreement regarding the Langhorne Sesame Place theme park. If we were to lose or have to renegotiate the Sesame License Agreement, our business may be adversely affected. ABI is the owner of the Busch Gardens trademarks and domain names. ABI has granted us a perpetual, exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use the Busch Gardens trademark and certain related domain names in connection with the operation, marketing, promotion and advertising of certain of our theme parks, as well as in connection with the production, use, distribution and sale of merchandise sold in connection with such theme parks. Under the license, we are required to indemnify ABI against losses related to our use of the marks. If we were to lose or have to renegotiate this license, our business may be adversely affected. 24 Our existing debt agreements contai n, and future debt agreements may contain, restrictions that may limit our flexibility in operating our business. Our existing debt agreements contain, and documents governing our future indebtedness may contain, financial and operating covenants that limit the discretion of management with respect to certain business matters. These covenants place restrictions on, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends and other distributions, make capital expenditures, make certain loans, investments and other restricted payments, enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends, engage in certain transactions with stockholders or affiliates, sell certain assets or engage in mergers, acquisitions and other business combinations, amend or otherwise alter the terms of our indebtedness, alter the business that we conduct, guarantee indebtedness or incur other contingent obligations and create liens. Our existing debt agreements also require, and documents governing our future indebtedness may require, us to meet certain financial ratios and tests. Our ability to comply with these and other provisions of the existing debt agreements is dependent on our future performance, which will be subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control. The breach of any of these covenants or non-compliance with any of these financial ratios and tests could result in an event of default under the existing debt agreements, which, if not cured or waived, could result in acceleration of the related debt and the acceleration of debt under other instruments evidencing indebtedness that may contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions. We discuss certain key covenants and financial ratios to which we are subject under our debt agreements in greater detail under the caption “Restrictive Covenants” in Note 12–Long-Term Debt to our accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and under “ Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations―Our Indebtedness―Covenant Compliance ”. Additionally, variable rate indebtedness subjects us to the risk of higher interest rates, which could cause our future debt service obligations to increase significantly. Changes to, or the elimination of, LIBOR may adversely affect interest expense related to our indebtedness. We expect current and future borrowings under our Term B-5 Loans which mature on March 31, 2024, and the New Revolving Credit Facility which matures on October 31, 2023 to be based on LIBOR. We have also hedged approximately $1.0 billion of LIBOR based debt which matures on March 14, 2020. In July 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), a regulator of financial services firms and financial markets in the United Kingdom, stated that it will plan for a phase out of regulatory oversight of LIBOR interest rates indices. The FCA has indicated it will support the LIBOR indices through 2021, to allow for an orderly transition to an alternative reference rate. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate any credit agreements or hedge transactions extending beyond 2021 that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established. Also, if we intend to hedge our LIBOR denominated debt, we cannot predict whether hedging opportunities will exist on acceptable terms. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee, which was charged with determining a replacement for LIBOR, has proposed the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), as its recommended alternative to LIBOR. Subsequent to that recommendation, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2018-16, Derivatives and Hedging which includes SOFR as a permitted rates that can be used in the application of hedge accounting pursuant to adoption of the standard (see Note–3 Recent Accounting Pronouncements to our accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual report on Form 10-K for further discussion). The Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing SOFR rates in April 2018. SOFR is intended to be a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by Treasury securities. The market transition away from LIBOR is expected to be gradual and complicated, and to include the development of term and credit adjustments to accommodate differences between LIBOR and SOFR. There can be no guarantee that SOFR will become widely used or that alternatives may be developed without additional complications. We are not able to predict whether LIBOR will cease to be available after 2021, whether SOFR will become a widely accepted benchmark in place of LIBOR, or what the impact of such a possible transition from LIBOR may be on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Failure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds, related margins, liquidity, and access to capital markets. Moody’s Investor Service and Standard & Poor’s Financial Services routinely evaluate our debt and issue ratings on our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. These ratings are based on a number of factors, which included their assessment of our financial strength, liquidity, capital structure, asset quality, and sustainability of cash flow and earnings. Due to changes in these factors and market conditions, we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings, which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins, liquidity and access to capital markets. For example, as of December 31, 2018, our Senior Secured Credit Facilities were rated by Standard and Poor’s Financial Services (corporate credit rated B with a positive outlook and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities rated B) and Moody’s Investors Service (corporate family rated B2 with a stable outlook and the Senior Secured Credit Facilities rated B2). We disclose these ratings to enhance the understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effects of these ratings on our costs of funds and related margins, liquidity and access to capital markets. Our borrowing costs depend, in part, on our credit ratings and any actions taken by these credit rating agencies to lower our credit ratings, could increase our borrowing costs. 25 Our leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness. As of December 31, 2018, our total indebtedness was approximately $1.553 billion. Our high degree of leverage could have important consequences, including the following: (i) a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations is dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available for operations, future business opportunities, share repurchases of the Company’s common stock and capital expenditures; (ii) our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate purposes in the future may be limited; (iii) certain of the borrowings are at variable rates of interest, which will increase our vulnerability to increases in interest rates; (iv) we are at a competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors; (v) we may be unable to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions; (vi) the debt service requirements of our other indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations; and (vii) we may be vulnerable in a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business and we may be unable to carry out activities that are important to our growth. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, or to pay interest on, or to refinance indebtedness depends on and is subject to our financial and operating performance, which in turn is affected by general and regional economic, financial, competitive, business and other factors beyond our control, including the availability of financing in the banking and capital markets. If unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs, we will need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity. There can be no assurance that any refinancing of our indebtedness will be possible and any such refinancing could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants that could further restrict our business operations. We from time to time may increase the amount of our indebtedness, modify the terms of our financing arrangements, issue dividends, make capital expenditures and take other actions that may substantially increase our leverage. Despite our significant leverage, we may incur significant additional amounts of debt, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our significant leverage. Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that we could suffer and our insurance costs may increase. We seek to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates. Although we maintain various safety and loss prevention programs and carry property and casualty insurance to cover certain risks, our insurance policies do not cover all types of losses and liabilities. There can be no assurance that our insurance will be sufficient to cover the full extent of all losses or liabilities for which we are insured, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to renew our current insurance policies on favorable terms, or at all. In addition, if we or other theme park operators sustain significant losses or make significant insurance claims, then our ability to obtain future insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates could be materially adversely affected. We may be unable to purchase or contract with third-party manufacturers for our theme park rides and attractions, or construction delays may occur and impact attraction openings. We may be unable to purchase or contract with third parties to build high quality rides and attractions and to continue to service and maintain those rides and attractions at competitive or beneficial prices, or to provide the replacement parts needed to maintain the operation of such rides. In addition, if our third-party suppliers’ financial condition deteriorates or they go out of business, we may not be able to obtain the full benefit of manufacturer warranties or indemnities typically contained in our contracts or may need to incur greater costs for the maintenance, repair, replacement or insurance of these assets. We may also incur unanticipated construction delays in completing capital projects which could adversely affect ride or attraction opening dates which could impact our attendance or revenues. Further, when rides and/or attractions have downtime and/or closures, our attendance or revenue could be adversely affected. Our operations and our ownership of property subject us to environmental requirements, and to environmental expenditures and liabilities. We incur costs to comply with environmental requirements, such as those relating to water use, wastewater and storm water management and disposal, air emissions control, hazardous materials management, solid and hazardous waste disposal, and the clean-up of properties affected by regulated materials. We have been required and continue to investigate and clean-up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases, and other releases, from current or formerly owned or operated facilities. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we generate, use and dispose of large volumes of water, including saltwater, which requires us to comply with a number of federal, state and local regulations and to incur significant expenses. Failure to comply with such regulations could subject us to fines and penalties and/or require us to incur additional expenses. Although we are not now classified as a large quantity generator of hazardous waste, we do store and handle hazardous materials to operate and maintain our equipment and facilities and have done so historically. 26 We cannot assure you that we will not incur substantial costs to comply with new or expanded environmental requirements in the future or to investigate or clean-up new or newly identified environmental conditions, which could also impair our ability to use or transfer the affected properties and to obtain financing. The suspension or termination of any of our business licenses may have a negative impact on our business. We maintain a variety of business licenses issued by federal, state and local authorities that are renewable on a periodic basis. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in renewing all of our licenses on a periodic basis. The suspension, termination or expiration of one or more of these licenses could materially adversely affect our revenues and profits. In addition, any changes to the licensing requirements for any of our licenses could affect our ability to maintain the licenses or increase the cost of retaining the license. Delays, restrictions or inability to obtain or maintain permits for capital investments could impair our business. Our capital investments require regulatory permits from one or more governmental agencies in order to improve existing or build new theme parks, rides, attractions and shows. Such permits are typically issued by state agencies, but federal and local governmental permits may also be required. The requirements for such permits vary depending on the location of such capital investments. As with all governmental permitting processes, there is a degree of uncertainty as to whether a permit will be granted, the time it will take for a permit to be issued, and the conditions that may be imposed in connection with the granting of the permit. Therefore, our capital investments in certain areas may be delayed, interrupted or suspended for varying lengths of time, causing a loss of revenue to us and adversely affecting our results of operations. Financial distress experienced by our strategic partners or other counterparties could have an adverse impact on us. We are party to numerous contracts of varying durations. Certain of our agreements are comprised of a mixture of firm and non-firm commitments, varying tenures and varying renewal terms, among other terms. There can be no guarantee that, upon the expiration of our contracts, we will be able to renew such contracts on terms as favorable to us, or at all. Although we attempt to assess the creditworthiness of our strategic partners and other contract counterparties, there can be no assurance as to the creditworthiness of any such strategic partner or contract counterparty. Financial distress experienced by our strategic partners or other counterparties could have an adverse impact in the event such parties are unable to pay us for the services we provide or otherwise fulfill their contractual obligations. We are exposed to the risk of loss in the event of non-performance by such strategic partners or other counterparties. Some of these counterparties may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating, market and regulatory risks, and some are experiencing, or may experience in the future, severe financial problems that have had or may have a significant impact on their creditworthiness. Since April 2018, there have been reports that ZHG or its affiliates have been experiencing financial distress. The inability of affiliates of ZHG Group to pay amounts due to us or otherwise fulfill their obligations to us under their agreements with us, including the Park Exclusivity and Concept Design Agreement (“ECDA”) and/or the Center Concept & Preliminary Design Support Agreement (“CDSA”), could have an adverse impact on us. In addition, the sale or transfer of our common stock owned by affiliates of ZHG Group, or the perception that such sales or transfers could occur, could harm the prevailing market price of shares of our common stock. We cannot provide any assurance that our strategic partners and other contractual counterparties will not become financially distressed or that such financially distressed strategic partners or counterparties will not default on their obligations to us or file for bankruptcy or other creditor protection. If one of such strategic partners or counterparties files for bankruptcy or other creditor protection, we may be unable to collect all, or even a significant portion, of amounts owed to us. Contracts with such strategic partners or counterparties could also be subject to renegotiation or rejection under applicable provisions of bankruptcy laws. If any such contract is rejected, we would be left with a general unsecured claim against such contract counterparty’s bankruptcy estate. The recovery rate on general unsecured claims is speculative and inherently uncertain, and it is possible that we may receive little to no recovery on account of such claim. Accordingly, significant strategic partner and other counterparty defaults and bankruptcy filings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Any material nonpayment or nonperformance from our contract counterparties due to inability or unwillingness to perform or adhere to contractual arrangements could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to make cash distributions to its shareholders. Furthermore, in the case of financially distressed strategic partners, such events might otherwise force such strategic partners to curtail their commercial relationships with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. 27 Changes to immigration, foreign trade, investments or other policies of the United States could adversely impact our business, financial condi tion and results of operations. Certain policies regarding foreign travel to the United States, foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment could adversely affect our business. For example, policies that strengthen the U.S. dollar against a variety of foreign currencies could impact international tourist spending, including at our theme parks. In addition, foreign tourists may opt to reduce their travel to the United States as a result of policies regarding immigration, foreign trade or other matters. While there is currently a substantial lack of clarity and uncertainty around the likelihood, timing and details of any such policies and reforms, such policies and reforms may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the value of our securities. Goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets represent a significant portion of our total assets, and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets. Our operations are capital intensive and require significant investment in long-lived assets, such as property, equipment and other long-lived assets and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant portion of our assets. We review goodwill and intangible assets at least annually for impairment. Impairment may result from, among other things, deterioration in park performance, adverse competitive conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations, including changes that restrict our activities or affect the services we offer, challenges to the validity of our intellectual property and a variety of other factors. For example, in 2017 due to financial performance at our SeaWorld Orlando park, we determined a triggering event had occurred that required an interim goodwill impairment test. Based on the results of the interim goodwill impairment test, we concluded that the goodwill for the SeaWorld Orlando reporting unit was fully impaired which resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of $269.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. See Note 9–Goodwill, Net, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. There is no assurance that we will not experience similar asset impairments in the future. Any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets would result in a non-cash charge against earnings, which would adversely affect our results of operations. Changes to tax laws may result in a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial condition. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), was enacted on December 22, 2017, and contains a number of changes to U.S. federal tax laws. The Tax Act requires complex computations that were not previously provided for under U.S. tax law and significantly revised the U.S. tax code by, among other changes, lowering the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and imposing limitations on the deductibility of interest. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has calculated the impact of the Tax Act in accordance with its current interpretation and available guidance, particularly as it relates to the future deductibility of executive compensation items and state conformity to the Tax Act. However, additional guidance may be issued by the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, the Department of the Treasury, or other governing body that may significantly differ from our interpretation of the law, which may result in a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial conditions . Tariffs or other trade restrictions could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We purchase some of our merchandise for resale and other products used in our business from entities which are located in foreign countries. Additionally, some of our ride manufacturers may be located in foreign countries or utilize components manufactured or sourced from foreign countries. These relationships expose us to risks associated with doing business globally, including changes in tariffs, quotas and other restrictions on imports (collectively, “Trade Restrictions”). Recently, the United States imposed increased tariffs on certain imports from China. While the current tariffs have not had a material impact on goods that we currently either import from China or purchase from domestic vendors which import from China, the U.S. administration has proposed additional tariffs on a list of thousands of categories of products that may be imposed imminently and expressed a willingness for further tariffs on goods imported from China, including on additional items that we purchase. While it is too early to predict how the recently enacted, proposed and any future tariffs or any other Trade Restrictions will impact our business, such Trade Restrictions would likely result in lower gross margin on impacted products, unless we are able to take successfully any one or more of the following mitigating actions: increase our prices, move production to countries with no or lower tariffs or away from domestic vendors who source from China or other tariff impacted countries, or alter or cease offering certain products. Any increase in pricing, alteration of products or reduced product offering could reduce the competitiveness of our products. Furthermore, any retaliatory counter-measures imposed by countries subject to such tariffs, such as China, could increase our, or our vendors’, import expenses. Additionally, even if the products we import are not directly impacted by additional tariffs, the imposition of such additional tariffs on goods imported into the United States could cause increased prices for consumer goods, in general, which could have a negative impact on consumer spending for discretionary items reducing attendance or spending at our parks. These direct and indirect impacts of increased tariffs or Trade Restrictions implemented by the United States, both individually and cumulatively, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of future operations. 28 We could be adversely impacted by actions of activist stockholders, and such activism could impact the value of our securities . We value constructive input from our stockholders and the investment community. Our Board and management team are committed to acting in the best interests of all of our stockholders. There is no assurance that the actions taken by our Board of Directors and management in seeking to maintain constructive engagement with our stockholders will be successful. Responding to actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management and our employees. Such activities could also interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plan and our long term growth. The perceived uncertainties as to our future direction caused by activist actions could affect the market price of our securities, result in the loss of potential business opportunities and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, board members and business partners. In addition, any interference with our annual meeting process, including but not limited to a proxy contest for the election of directors at our annual meeting, could require us to incur significant legal and other advisory fees and proxy solicitation expenses and require significant time and attention by management and our Board. Affiliates of Hill Path Capital LP could be able to significantly influence our decisions and their interests may conflict with ours or yours in the future. On February 14, 2019, Hill Path Capital LP and affiliated entities (“Hill Path”) filed with the SEC a Schedule 13F reporting that such persons had accumulated a total of 13,991,306 shares of the Company’s common stock, which represented approximately 16.6% of the Company’s total outstanding shares of common stock as of December 31, 2018. In addition, on November 7, 2017, Hill Path filed a Schedule 13D which stated, among other things, that they may suggest changes in the Company’s business, operations, capital structure, capital allocation, corporate governance and other strategic matters. As described in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on November 7, 2017, we entered into a cooperation agreement and certain related agreements with Hill Path with a view to working collaboratively to build long term stockholder value. Pursuant to the cooperation agreement, on November 5, 2017, the Board appointed Scott I. Ross (the “Designee”) to the Board and created the Revenue Committee of the Board. The Revenue Committee is responsible for the development, articulation and execution of the Company’s short-term and long-term revenue-growth strategies. For so long as the Designee remains on our Board, Hill Path will have influence with respect to our management, business plans and policies, including the appointment and removal of our officers. Also, for so long as Hill Path continues to own a significant percentage of our stock, Hill Path may be able to influence whether or not a change of control of our Company or a change in the composition of our Board of Directors occurs. The concentration of ownership could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of common stock as part of a sale of our company and ultimately might affect the market price of our common stock. Affiliates of ZHG Group will be able to significantly influence our decisions and their interests may conflict with ours or yours in the future. Affiliates of ZHG Group beneficially own approximately 23.1% of our common stock as of December 31, 2018 and have the ability to elect a specified number of members of our Board of Directors as described in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on March 24, 2017. Thus, for so long as ZHG Group continues to own specified percentages of our stock, ZHG Group will be able to influence the composition of our Board of Directors and the approval of actions requiring stockholder approval. Accordingly, during that period of time, ZHG Group will have influence with respect to our management, business plans and policies, including the appointment and removal of our officers. For example, for so long as ZHG Group continues to own a significant percentage of our stock, ZHG Group may be able to influence whether or not a change of control of our company or a change in the composition of our Board of Directors occurs. The concentration of ownership could deprive you of an opportunity to receive a premium for your shares of common stock as part of a sale of our company and ultimately might affect the market price of our common stock. ZHG Group and its respective affiliates engage in a broad spectrum of activities, including investments in the real estate, leisure, culture, and tourism industries. In the ordinary course of their business activities, ZHG Group and its respective affiliates may engage in activities in which their interests conflict with ours or those of our stockholders. Under the Company’s stockholders agreement with ZHG Group, the Company agreed to renounce any interest or expectancy, or right to be offered an opportunity to participate in, any business opportunity or corporate opportunity presented to ZHG Group or its affiliates. ZHG Group also may pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may be unavailable to us. In addition, ZHG Group may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their respective investments, even though such transactions might involve risks to you. 29 Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock Our stock price may change significantly, and you may not be able to sell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid or at all, and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result. The trading price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile. Since shares of our common stock were sold in our IPO in April 2013 through December 31, 2018, our common stock close price has ranged from $10.61 to $38.92. In addition to the risk factors discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the trading price of our common stock may be adversely affected due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: • results of operations that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors; • results of operations that vary from those of our competitors; • changes in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates and investment recommendations by securities analysts and investors; • declines in the market prices of stocks generally, or those of amusement and theme parks companies; • strategic actions by us or our competitors; • announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, new products, acquisitions, joint marketing relationships, joint ventures, other strategic relationships or capital commitments; • changes in general economic or market conditions or trends in our industry or markets; • changes in business or regulatory conditions; • future sales of our common stock or other securities; • repurchases of our common stock; • investor perceptions or the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment alternatives; • the public’s response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the SEC; • rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry, particularly with respect to strategic transactions; • announcements relating to litigation; • guidance, if any, that we provide to the public, any changes in this guidance or our failure to meet this guidance; • the development and sustainability of an active trading market for our stock; • actions by institutional or activist stockholders; • changes in accounting principles; and • other events or factors, including those resulting from natural disasters, war, acts of terrorism or responses to these events. We have suspended the dividend on our common stock, and our indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock in the future. In September 2016, our Board suspended the Company’s quarterly dividend to allow the Company greater flexibility to deploy capital to opportunities that offer the greatest long term returns to shareholders, such as, but not limited to, share repurchases, investments in new attractions or debt repayments. Future dividends, if any, and the timing of declaration of any such dividends, will be at the discretion of the Board and will depend upon many factors, including, but not limited to, our results of operations, financial condition, level of indebtedness, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, restrictions in our debt agreements and in any preferred stock, business prospects and other factors that the Board deems relevant. Our ability to declare dividends and make other restricted payments is limited by covenants in our senior secured credit facilities pursuant to a credit agreement dated as of December 1, 2009, as the same may be amended, restated, supplemented or modified from time to time (the “Senior Secured Credit Facilities”). The fiscal amount available for dividend declarations, share repurchases and other restricted payments under the covenant restrictions in the debt agreements adjusts at the beginning of each quarter. See Note 12–Long-Term Debt in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 30 W e cannot guarantee that our allocation of capital to various alternatives will enhance long-term stockholder value, and in some cases, our Share Repurchase Program could increase the volatility of the price of our common stock. Our goal is to invest capital to maximize our overall long-term returns. This includes spending on capital projects and expenses, managing debt levels, and periodically returning capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. There can be no assurance that our capital allocation decisions will enhance shareholder value. During 2018, we repurchased a total of 3,654,816 shares of common stock at a total cost of approximately $98.0 million, leaving approximately $92.0 million available under the Share Repurchase Program as of December 31, 2018. On February 22, 2019, our Board authorized a replenishment to our Share Repurchase Program of $158.0 million, bringing the total amount authorized for future share repurchases to $250.0 million. The number of shares to be purchased and the timing of purchases will be based on our trading windows and available liquidity, general business and market conditions and other factors, including legal requirements and alternative opportunities. There were no share repurchases during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. Repurchases of our common stock pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. The existence of the Share Repurchase Program could cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. There can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock. Although the Share Repurchase Program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, there is no assurance that it will do so and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce such program’s effectiveness. If securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our stock or our sector, our stock price and trading volume could decline. The trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We do not control these analysts. Furthermore, if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrade our stock or our industry, or the stock of any of our competitors, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of the Company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Future sales, or the perception of future sales, by us or our existing stockholders in the public market could cause the market price for our common stock to decline. The sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could harm the prevailing market price of shares of our common stock. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. Shares held by ZHG Group, Hill Path and certain of our directors, officers and employees are eligible for resale, subject to volume, manner of sale and other limitations under Rule 144. In addition, pursuant to a registration rights agreement entered into in connection with the ZHG Transaction, we granted ZHG Group the right, subject to certain conditions, to require us to register the sale of their shares of common stock under the Securities Act. We also entered into a side letter with Hill Path on November 5, 2017 that provides if it obtains any requisite Board approval or the consent of ZHG, the Company will execute and deliver to Hill Path a form of registration rights agreement which grants Hill Path limited shelf registration rights with respect to their common stock (including certain demand underwritten offering rights and piggyback registration rights) under the Securities Act. As restrictions on resale end or if ZHG Group or Hill Path exercise their registration rights, the market price of our shares of common stock could drop significantly if the holders of these shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through future offerings of our shares of common stock or other securities. In addition, the shares of our common stock reserved for future issuance under the 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan will become eligible for sale in the public market once those shares are issued, subject to provisions relating to various vesting agreements, any applicable lock-up agreements in effect from time to time and Rule 144, as applicable. A total of 15,000,000 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under the 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan, of which approximately 9,770,000 shares of common stock remain available for future issuance as of December 31, 2018. In the future, we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions. The amount of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of our common stock. Any issuance of additional securities in connection with investments or acquisitions may result in additional dilution to you. 31 Anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control. Certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, defer or prevent a merger, acquisition, tender offer, takeover attempt or other change of control transaction that a stockholder might consider in its best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by our stockholders. These provisions provide for, among other things: • the ability of our Board of Directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock; • advance notice for nominations of directors by stockholders and for stockholders to include matters to be considered at our annual meetings; • certain limitations on convening special stockholder meetings; • the removal of directors with or without cause only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66.67% in voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of stock of the Company entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class; and • that certain provisions may be amended only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66.67% in voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of stock of the Company entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class. These anti-takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if the third-party’s offer may be considered beneficial by many of our stockholders. As a result, our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares. The concentration of ownership of our capital stock limits your ability to influence corporate matters. Our executive officers, directors, current 5% or greater stockholders and entities affiliated with them beneficially owned (as determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC) approximately 53.7% of our common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2018. This significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with controlling stockholders. Also, these stockholders, acting together, may be able to control our management and affairs and matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions, such as mergers, consolidations or the sale of substantially all of our assets. Consequently, this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, including a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control, even if that change of control would benefit our other stockholders. Non-U.S. holders who own or owned more than a certain ownership threshold may be subject to United States federal income tax on gains realized on the disposition of our common stock. We believe that we are currently a U.S. real property holding corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. So long as our common stock continues to be regularly traded on an established securities market, a non-U.S. stockholder who holds or held (at any time during the shorter of the five year period preceding the date of disposition or the holder’s holding period) more than 5% of our common stock will be subject to United States federal income tax on the disposition of our common stock. Non-U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the consequences of disposing of shares of our common stock. 32 Item 1B. Unresolv ed Staff Comments None. Item 2. Properties The following table summarizes our principal properties, which includes approximately 400 acres of land available for future development. Location Size Use Orlando, FL 76,360 sq ft Leased Office Space (corporate headquarters) (a) Orlando, FL 9,636 sq ft Leased Office Space (call center) San Diego, CA 190 acres (b) Leased Land Chula Vista, CA 66 acres Owned Water Park Orlando, FL 279 acres Owned Theme Park Orlando, FL 58 acres Owned All-inclusive Interactive Park Orlando, FL 81 acres Owned Water Park Tampa, FL 56 acres Owned Water Park Tampa, FL 306 acres Owned Theme Park Dade City, FL 109 acres Owned Breeding and Holding Facility Langhorne, PA 55 acres Owned Theme Park San Antonio, TX 397 acres Owned Theme Park San Antonio, TX 18 acres Owned Water Park Williamsburg, VA 222 acres Owned Water Park Williamsburg, VA 422 acres Owned Theme Park Williamsburg, VA 5 acres Owned Warehouse Space Williamsburg, VA 5 acres Owned Seasonal Worker Lodging (a) The lease agreement for our corporate headquarters building expires on September 30, 2019. We are currently building a new corporate headquarters building on owned land adjacent to our SeaWorld Orlando park. (b) Includes approximately 17 acres of water in Mission Bay Park, California. We believe that our properties are in good operating condition and adequately serve our current business operations. Lease Agreement with City of San Diego Our subsidiary, Sea World LLC (f/k/a Sea World Inc.), leases approximately 190 acres from the City of San Diego, including approximately 17 acres of water in Mission Bay Park, California (the “Premises”). The current lease term commenced on July 1, 1998 and extends for 50 years or the maximum period allowed by law. Under the lease, the Premises must be used as a marine park facility and related uses. In addition, we may not operate another marine park facility within a radius of 560 miles from the City of San Diego. The annual rent under the lease is calculated on the basis of a specified percentage of Sea World LLC’s gross income from the Premises, or the minimum yearly rent, whichever is greater. The minimum yearly rent is adjusted every three years to an amount equal to 80% of the average accounting year rent actually paid for the three previous years. The current minimum yearly rent is approximately $10.4 million, which is subject to adjustment on January 1, 2020. Item 3. Legal Proceedings We are subject to various allegations, claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. While it is impossible to determine with certainty the ultimate outcome of any of these proceedings, lawsuits and claims, management believes that adequate provisions have been made and insurance secured for all currently pending proceedings so that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position. 33 Securities Class Action Lawsuits On September 9, 2014, a purported stockholder class action lawsuit consisting of purchasers of the Company’s common stock during the periods between April 18, 2013 and August 13, 2014, captioned Baker v. SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc., et al., Case No. 14-CV-02129-MMA (KSC), was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California against the Company, the Chairman of the Company’s Board, certain of its executive officers and Blackstone. On February 17, 2015, Court-appointed Lead Plaintiffs, Pensionskassen For Børne- Og Ungdomspædagoger and Arkansas Public Employees Retirement System, together with additional plaintiffs, Oklahoma City Employee Retirement System and Pembroke Pines Firefighters and Police Officers Pension Fund (collectively, “Plaintiffs”), then filed an amended complaint against the Company, the Chairman of the Company’s Board, certain of its executive officers, Blackstone, and underwriters of the initial public offering and secondary public offerings. The amended complaint alleges, among other things, that the prospectus and registration statements filed contained materially false and misleading information in violation of the federal securities laws and seeks unspecified compensatory damages and other relief. Plaintiffs contend that defendants knew or were reckless in not knowing that Blackfish was impacting SeaWorld’s business at the time of each public statement. On May 29, 2015, the Company and the other defendants filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint which the Court granted on March 31, 2016. On May 31, 2016, Plaintiffs filed a second amended consolidated class action complaint (“Second Amended Complaint”), which, among other things, no longer names the Company’s Board or underwriters as defendants The Court later denied a renewed motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint. In May 2017, Plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification which the Court granted on November 29, 2017. On December 13, 2017, Defendants filed a petition for permission to appeal the Court’s class certification order with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which was denied on June 28, 2018. Discovery is currently ongoing with the trial scheduled for fall 2019. The Company believes that the class action lawsuit is without merit and intends to defend the lawsuit vigorously; however, there can be no assurance regarding the ultimate outcome of this lawsuit. On June 14, 2018, a lawsuit captioned Highfields Capital I LP et al. v. SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. et al., Civil Action No. 18-cv-1276L-BLM was filed in the United States District Court in the Southern District of California against the Company and certain of the Company’s former and present executive officers (collectively, the “Defendants”). The plaintiffs, which are investment funds managed by a common adviser (collectively, the “Plaintiffs”) allege, among other things, that the Defendants made false and misleading statements in violation of the federal securities laws regarding the impact of the documentary Blackfish on SeaWorld’s business. The complaint further alleges that such statements were made to induce Plaintiffs to purchase common stock of the Company at artificially-inflated prices and that Plaintiffs suffered investment losses as a result. The Plaintiffs are seeking unspecified compensatory damages and other relief. On October 19, 2018, Defendants filed a motion for the partial dismissal of the Plaintiffs’ complaint. On February 7, 2019, the Court granted Defendants’ motion, with leave to amend. The Company believes that the lawsuit is without merit and intends to defend the lawsuit vigorously; however, there can be no assurance regarding the ultimate outcome of this lawsuit. Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit On December 8, 2014, a putative derivative lawsuit captioned Kistenmacher v. Atchison, et al., Civil Action No. 10437, was filed in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware against, among others, the Chairman of the Company’s Board, certain of the Company’s executive officers, directors and shareholders, and Blackstone. The Company is a “Nominal Defendant” in the lawsuit. On March 30, 2015, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint against the same set of defendants. The amended complaint alleges, among other things, that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties, aided and abetted breaches of fiduciary duties, violated Florida Blue Sky laws and were unjustly enriched by (i) including materially false and misleading information in the prospectus and registration statements; and (ii) causing the Company to repurchase certain shares of its common stock from certain shareholders at an alleged artificially inflated price. The Company does not maintain any direct exposure to loss in connection with this shareholder derivative lawsuit as the lawsuit does not assert any claims against the Company. The Company’s status as a “Nominal Defendant” in the action reflects the fact that the lawsuit is maintained by the named plaintiff on behalf of the Company and that the plaintiff seeks damages on the Company’s behalf. The case is currently stayed in favor of the securities class action captioned Baker v. SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc., et al. described above. Consumer Lawsuit On April 13, 2015, a purported class action was filed in the Superior Court of the State of California for the City and County of San Francisco against SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc., captioned Marc Anderson, et. al., v. SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc. Civil Case No. 15-cv-02172-JSW, (the “Anderson Matter”). The putative class consisted of all consumers within California who, within the past four years, purchased tickets to SeaWorld San Diego. The complaint (as amended) alleges causes of action under the California False Advertising Law, California Unfair Competition Law and California CLRA. Plaintiffs’ claims are based on their allegations that the Company misrepresented the physical living conditions and care and treatment of its orcas, resulting in confusion or misunderstanding among ticket and orca plush purchasers with intent to deceive and mislead the plaintiffs and purported class members. The complaint seeks actual damages, equitable relief, attorneys’ fees and costs. Based on plaintiffs’ definition of the class, the amount in controversy could have exceeded $5.0 million assuming the class became certified. The liability exposure is speculative though. On May 14, 2015, the Company removed the case to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. 34 The C ompany filed a motion for summary judgment on October 30, 2017 which the Court granted in part and denied in part. On May 23, 2018, the plaintiffs represented to the Court that they will not file a motion for class certification. The case is no longer a class action. All three named plaintiffs continue to have claims for individual restitution in a nominal amount and injunctive relief. Trial is currently scheduled for October 2019. The Company believes that the lawsuit is without merit and intends to de fend the lawsuit vigorously; however, there can be no assurance regarding the ultimate outcome of these lawsuits. EZPay Plan Class Action Lawsuit On December 3, 2014, a purported class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division against SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc., captioned Jason Herman, Joey Kratt, and Christina Lancaster, as individuals and on behalf of all others similarly situated, v. SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc. Case no: 8:14-cv-03028-MSS-JSS. The certified class action currently consists of two claims for breach of contract, unjust enrichment and violation of federal Electronic Funds Transfer Act, 15 U.S.C. section 1693 et seq. on behalf of three individual plaintiffs as well as on behalf of a two classes: (i) individuals in the states of Florida, Texas, Virginia and California who paid for an annual pass through EZ pay in “less than twelve months,” had their passes automatically renewed and did not use the renewed passes after the first year or were not issued a full refund of payments made after the twelfth payment; and (ii) all of these same individuals who used debit cards. In April 2018, the Company reached a preliminary agreement in principle to settle this matter for a payment of $11.5 million, plus certain administrative costs and expenses associated with the proposed settlement. The proposed settlement is still subject to further documentation and court approval. The Company has accrued $11.5 million related to this proposed settlement in other accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Other Matters The Company is a party to various other claims and legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business. In addition, from time to time the Company is subject to audits, inspections and investigations by, or receives requests for information from, various federal and state regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”), the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“Cal-OSHA”), the Florida Fish & Wildlife Commission (“FWC”), the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”), the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). In September 2018, the Company reached a settlement with the SEC relating to a previously disclosed SEC investigation. In connection with the settlement, without admitting or denying the substantive allegations in the SEC’s complaint, the Company agreed to the entry of a final judgment ordering the Company to pay a civil penalty of $4.0 million and enjoining the Company from violation of certain provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and certain rules thereunder. The settlement was approved by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on September 24, 2018. The settlement is recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 in the Company’s consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. On December 11, 2018, the DOJ informed the Company that it does not intend to take any action against the Company or any individuals in connection with the investigation previously disclosed by the Company concerning disclosures and public statements made by the Company and certain individuals on or before August 2014 and trading in the Company’s securities. The Company considers the DOJ matter concluded. From time to time, various parties also bring other lawsuits against the Company. Matters where an unfavorable outcome to the Company is probable and which can be reasonably estimated are accrued. Such accruals, which are not material for any period presented, are based on information known about the matters, the Company’s estimate of the outcomes of such matters, and the Company’s experience in contesting, litigating and settling similar matters. Matters that are considered reasonably possible to result in a material loss are not accrued for, but an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss is disclosed, if such amount or range can be determined. At this time, management does not expect any such known claims, legal proceedings or regulatory matters to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion contains management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations and should be read together with “Selected Financial Data” and the historical consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those described in the “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. You should carefully read “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors.” Business Overview We are a leading theme park and entertainment company providing experiences that matter and inspiring guests to protect animals and the wild wonders of our world. We own or license a portfolio of recognized brands, including SeaWorld, Busch Gardens, Aquatica, Discovery Cove, Sesame Place and Sea Rescue. Over our more than 50-year history, we have developed a diversified portfolio of 12 highly differentiated theme parks and water parks that are grouped in key markets across the United States. Many of our parks showcase our one-of-a-kind zoological collection and all of our parks feature a diverse array of thrill and family rides, shows, educational demonstrations and/or other attractions with broad demographic appeal which deliver memorable experiences and a strong value proposition for our guests. Principal Factors and Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations Revenues Our revenues are driven primarily by attendance in our theme parks and the level of per capita spending for admission and per capita spending for culinary, merchandise and other in-park products. We define attendance as the number of guest visits. Attendance drives admissions revenue as well as total in-park spending. Admissions revenue primarily consists of single-day tickets, annual or season passes (collectively referred to as season passes) or other multi-day or multi-park admission products. Total revenue per capita, defined as total revenue divided by total attendance, consists of admission per capita and in-park per capita spending: • Admission per capita. We calculate admission per capita as total admissions revenue divided by total attendance. Admission per capita is primarily driven by ticket pricing, the admissions product mix and the park attendance mix, among other factors. The admissions product mix, also referred to as the visitation mix, is defined as the mix of attendance by ticket category such as single day, multi-day, annual passes or complimentary tickets and the park attendance mix is defined as the mix of theme parks visited. The mix of theme parks visited can impact admission per capita based on the theme park’s respective pricing which on average is lower for our water parks compared to our other theme parks. • In-Park Per Capita Spending. We calculate in-park per capita spending as total food, merchandise and other revenue divided by total attendance. Food, merchandise and other revenue primarily consists of culinary, merchandise and other in-park products and also includes other miscellaneous revenue not necessarily generated in our parks, which is not significant in the periods presented, including revenue related to our international agreements. In-park per capita spending is primarily driven by pricing changes, penetration levels (percentage of guests purchasing), new product offerings, the mix of guests (such as local, domestic or international guests) and the mix of in-park spending, among other factors. See further discussion in the “ Results of Operations ” section which follows. For other factors affecting our revenues, see the “ Risk Factors ” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Attendance The level of attendance in our theme parks is a function of many factors, including affordability, the opening of new attractions and shows, competitive offerings, weather, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and global and regional economic conditions, travel patterns of both our domestic and international guests, marketing and sales efforts, awareness of park offerings, consumer confidence and external perceptions of our brands and reputation, among other factors beyond our control. Attendance patterns have significant seasonality, driven by the timing of holidays, school vacations and weather conditions; in addition, seven of our theme parks are seasonal and only open for part of the year. 39 We believe attendance in recent years was impacted by a variety of factors at some of our parks, including the external perceptions of our brands and reputation, which also impacted relationships with some of our business partners. Given current attendance results, we do not believe these factors have had a significant impact on our current 2018 attendance trends; however, we continuously monitor our external perceptions, making strategic marketing and sales adjustments as necessary, to address these or any other items that could impact attendance. Costs and Expenses The principal costs of our operations are employee wages and benefits, advertising, maintenance, animal care, utilities and insurance. Factors that affect our costs and expenses include competitive wage pressures including minimum wage legislation, commodity prices, costs for construction, repairs and maintenance, other inflationary pressures and attendance levels, among other factors. We continue to actively work to find additional cost savings opportunities. As part of these efforts, on August 7, 2018, we implemented a new restructuring program (the “2018 Restructuring Program”) focused on reducing costs, improving operating margins and streamlining our management structure to create efficiencies and better align with our strategic business objectives. As a result, we recorded $5.5 million in pre-tax restructuring charges related to this program in the year ended December 31, 2018 which primarily relates to severance and other expenses incurred in connection with the 2018 Restructuring Program. Restructuring and other separation costs for the year ended December 31, 2018, also includes severance and other employment expenses for certain executives and employees who separated from the Company. See Note 21–Restructuring Programs and Other Separation Costs to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. We make annual investments to support and improve our existing theme park facilities and attractions. Maintaining and improving our theme parks, as well as opening new attractions, is critical to remain competitive, grow revenue, and increase our guests’ length of stay. For further discussion of our new attractions for 2019, see “ Capital Improvements ” in the “Business” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For other factors affecting our costs and expenses, see the “ Risk Factors ” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as such risk factors may be updated from time to time in our periodic filings with the SEC. Seasonality The theme park industry is seasonal in nature. Historically, we generate the highest revenues in the second and third quarters of each year, in part because seven of our theme parks are only open for a portion of the year. Approximately two-thirds of our attendance and revenues are generated in the second and third quarters of the year and we typically incur a net loss in the first and fourth quarters. The percent mix of revenues by quarter is relatively constant each year, but revenues can shift between the first and second quarters due to the timing of Easter and spring break holidays and between the first and fourth quarters due to the timing of holiday breaks around Christmas and New Year. Even for our five theme parks open year-round, attendance patterns have significant seasonality, driven by holidays, school vacations and weather conditions. Regulatory Developments See the discussion of relevant regulatory developments under “ Recent Regulatory Developments ” in the “ Business ” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a discussion of certain risks associated with federal and state regulations governing the treatment of animals, see the “ Risk Factors ” section included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including “ Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry—We are subject to complex federal and state regulations governing the treatment of animals, which can change, and to claims and lawsuits by activist groups before government regulators and in the courts. ” Recent Developments Leadership Changes On February 5, 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors (the “Board”) appointed Gustavo (“Gus”) Antorcha to serve as Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) of the Company. In addition, the Board increased the size of the Board from eight to nine directors and elected Mr. Antorcha to serve as a director. Mr. Antorcha assumed his CEO role and director role, in each case, effective on February 18, 2019. In connection with the appointment of Mr. Antorcha as CEO, the Board appointed John T. Reilly, who will step down from the position of Interim CEO, to serve as Chief Operating Officer (“COO”) of the Company, effective at such time. Additionally, we announced that Yoshikazu Maruyama would resume his role as non-executive Chairman of the Board, effective February 18, 2019. 40 On February 26, 2018, Joel K. Manby (the “Former CEO”) stepped down from his position as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and resigned as a member of our Board of Directors. In connection with his departure, the Former CEO received severance-related benefits in accordance with his employment agreement. Certain other executives who separated from the Company during 2018 also received severance-related benefits in accordance w ith the terms of their respective employment agreements or relevant company plan, as applicable. These expenses are included in restructuring and other separation costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 in the accompanying consolidated statements of co mprehensive income (loss) included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additionally, certain equity awards were accelerated to vest in connection with the departure of specific executives as required by their respective employment agreements. As a result, we recorded incremental non-cash equity compensation expense related to these awards, which is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the year ended December 31, 2018 in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). See Note 21–Restructuring Programs and Other Separation Costs and Note 19–Equity-Based Compensation in our notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), was enacted on December 22, 2017, and contains a number of changes to U.S. federal tax laws. The Tax Act requires complex computations that were not previously provided for under U.S. tax law and significantly revised the U.S. tax code by, among other changes, lowering the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, and imposing limitations on the deductibility of interest. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has calculated the impact of the Tax Act in accordance with its current interpretation and available guidance, particularly as it relates to the future deductibility of executive compensation items and state conformity to the Tax Act. See discussion in Note 14–Income Taxes in our notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Results of Operations The following discussion provides an analysis of our consolidated financial data for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. This data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in “ Financial Statements and Supplementary Data ” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 41 Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 20 18 and 2017 The following table presents key operating and financial information for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017: For the Year Ended December 31, Variance 2018 2017 $ % Selected Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) Data: (In thousands, except per capita data and %) Net revenues: Admissions $ 798,793 $ 765,072 $ 33,721 4.4 % Food, merchandise and other 573,497 498,252 75,245 15.1 % Total revenues 1,372,290 1,263,324 108,966 8.6 % Costs and expenses: Cost of food, merchandise and other revenues 106,604 95,914 10,690 11.1 % Operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below and includes equity compensation of $7,387 and $7,049 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively) 705,954 702,111 3,843 0.5 % Selling, general and administrative expenses (includes equity compensation of $14,765 and $16,154 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively) 229,724 228,836 888 0.4 % Goodwill impairment charge — 269,332 (269,332 ) NM Restructuring and other separation costs 17,386 5,200 12,186 NM Depreciation and amortization 160,955 163,294 (2,339 ) (1.4 %) Total costs and expenses 1,220,623 1,464,687 (244,064 ) (16.7 %) Operating income (loss) 151,667 (201,363 ) 353,030 NM Other income, net (100 ) (115 ) 15 (13.0 %) Interest expense 80,914 78,001 2,913 3.7 % Loss on early extinguishment of debt and write- off of discounts and debt issuance costs 8,150 8,143 7 0.1 % Income (loss) before income taxes 62,703 (287,392 ) 350,095 NM Provision for (benefit from) income taxes 17,915 (85,006 ) 102,921 NM Net income (loss) $ 44,788 $ (202,386 ) $ 247,174 NM Other data: Attendance 22,582 20,798 1,784 8.6 % Total revenue per capita $ 60.77 $ 60.74 $ 0.03 0.0 % NM-Not Meaningful Admissions revenue . Admissions revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $33.7 million, or 4.4%, to $798.8 million as compared to $765.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in admissions revenue was primarily a result of an overall increase in attendance of approximately 1.8 million guests, or 8.6%, which was partially offset by a decline in admission per capita. We believe the improved attendance results from a combination of factors including new pricing strategies, new marketing and communications initiatives and the anticipation and positive reception of our new rides, attractions and events. Attendance, in the fourth quarter, also benefited from the popularity and expansion of special event days for our Christmas events at some of our parks. These factors were slightly offset by negative impacts from unfavorable weather in 2018 compared to 2017. Admission per capita decreased by 3.9% to $35.37 in 2018 compared to $36.79 in 2017. This decrease was more than offset by an increase in in-park per capita spending as discussed below. Among other factors, the decline in admission per capita results primarily from the impact of new pricing strategies when compared to the prior year. Food, merchandise and other revenue . Food, merchandise and other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $75.2 million, or 15.1% to $573.5 million as compared to $498.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase results from improved attendance along with an increase in in-park per capita spending. In-park per capita spending increased by 6.0%, to $25.40 in 2018 from $23.96 in 2017. In-park per capita spending improved primarily due to the increased sales of in-park products. Costs of food, merchandise and other revenues. Costs of food, merchandise and other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $10.7 million, or 11.1%, to $106.6 million as compared to $95.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to an increase in related revenues. These costs represent 18.6% and 19.3% of related revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 42 Operating expenses . Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $3.8 million, or 0.5% to $706.0 million as compared to $702.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase primarily relates to an increase of $6.4 million in fixed asset disposals and $2.8 milli on of expenses incurred and fees associated with the termination of an agreement, partially offset by a decline in other expenses (see Note 8–Property and Equipment, Net and Note 15–Commitments and Contingencies in our notes to the consolidated financial s tatements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Operating expenses were 51.4% of total revenues in 2018 compared to 55.6% in 2017. The decrease as a percent of total revenue results primarily from a focus on cost efficiencies and the impa ct of cost savings initiatives. Selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by $0.9 million, or 0.4% to $229.7 million as compared to $228.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase primarily relates to an increase in marketing, strategic consulting services and legal costs partially offset by a decline in labor and barter expense. The increase in legal costs largely relates to legal settlement accruals of $8.1 million recorded in the first quarter of 2018 and a settlement of $4.0 million recorded in the second quarter of 2018, partially offset by lower legal fees (see Note 15–Commitments and Contingencies in our notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details). As a percentage of total revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses were 16.7% in 2018 compared to 18.1% in 2017, reflecting our focus on cost efficiencies and the impact of cost savings initiatives. Goodwill impairment charge . The goodwill impairment charge for the year ended December 31, 2017 relates to the full impairment of the goodwill for our SeaWorld Orlando reporting unit. See Note 9–Goodwill, Net to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Restructuring and other separation costs. Restructuring and other separation costs of $17.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily relates to severance and other termination benefits associated with employees who separated from the Company, including approximately $6.7 million in severance and other employment expenses for our Former CEO and approximately $5.5 million related to the 2018 Restructuring Program. Restructuring and other separation costs of $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 represent severance and other termination benefits associated with certain positions which were eliminated in the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of the 2017 Restructuring Program. See Note 21–Restructuring Programs and Other Separation Costs in our notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased by $2.3 million, or 1.4% to $161.0 million as compared to $163.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease primarily relates to the impact of asset retirements and fully depreciated assets, partially offset by new asset additions. Interest expense. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased $2.9 million, or 3.7% to $80.9 million as compared to $78.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase primarily relates to increased LIBOR rates and the impact of Amendments No. 8 and No. 9 to our Senior Secured Credit Facilities entered into on March 31, 2017 and October 31, 2018, respectively, partially offset by the impact of interest rate swap agreements. See Note 12 –Long-Term Debt to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the “ Our Indebtedness ” section which follows for further details. Loss on early extinguishment of debt and write-off of discounts and debt issuance costs. Loss on early extinguishment of debt and write-off of discounts and debt issuance costs of $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily relates to a write-off of discounts and debt issuance costs resulting from Amendment No. 9 to our Senior Secured Credit Facilities entered into on October 31, 2018. Loss on early extinguishment of debt and write-off of discounts and debt issuance costs of $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily relates to a write-off of discounts and debt issuance costs resulting from Amendment No. 8 to our Senior Secured Credit Facilities entered into on March 31, 2017. See Note 12–Long-Term Debt to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the “ Our Indebtedness” section which follows for further details. Provision for (benefit from) income taxes. Provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $17.9 million compared to a benefit from income taxes of $85.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. The change primarily resulted from pretax income in 2018 compared to a pretax loss in 2017. Our consolidated effective tax rate was 28.6% for 2018 compared to 29.6% for 2017. The decrease primarily results from a reduction in the corporate federal tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 due to the Tax Act mostly offset by the reduced tax benefit in 2017 related to nondeductible equity compensation and a goodwill impairment charge. See Note 14–Income Taxes in our notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. 43 Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 The following table presents key operating and financial information for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016: For the Year Ended December 31, Variance 2017 2016 $ % Selected Statements of Comprehensive Loss Data: (In thousands, except per capita data and %) Net revenues: Admissions $ 765,072 $ 817,793 $ (52,721 ) (6.4 %) Food, merchandise and other 498,252 526,499 (28,247 ) (5.4 %) Total revenues 1,263,324 1,344,292 (80,968 ) (6.0 %) Costs and expenses: Cost of food, merchandise and other revenues 95,914 100,643 (4,729 ) (4.7 %) Operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below and includes equity compensation of $7,049 and $11,033 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively) 702,111 736,842 (34,731 ) (4.7 %) Selling, general and administrative expenses (includes equity compensation of $16,154 and $26,482 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively) 228,836 238,557 (9,721 ) (4.1 %) Goodwill impairment charge 269,332 — 269,332 ND Restructuring and other separation costs 5,200 9,016 (3,816 ) (42.3 %) Depreciation and amortization 163,294 199,649 (36,355 ) (18.2 %) Total costs and expenses 1,464,687 1,284,707 179,980 14.0 % Operating (loss) income (201,363 ) 59,585 (260,948 ) NM Other (income) expense, net (115 ) 125 (240 ) NM Interest expense 78,001 62,661 15,340 24.5 % Loss on early extinguishment of debt and write- off of discounts and debt issuance costs 8,143 — 8,143 ND Loss before income taxes (287,392 ) (3,201 ) (284,191 ) NM (Benefit from) provision for income taxes (85,006 ) 9,330 (94,336 ) NM Net loss $ (202,386 ) $ (12,531 ) $ (189,855 ) NM Other data: Attendance 20,798 22,000 (1,202 ) (5.5 %) Total revenue per capita $ 60.74 $ 61.10 $ (0.36 ) (0.6 %) ND-Not Determinable NM-Not Meaningful Admissions revenue . Admissions revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased $52.7 million, or 6.4%, to $765.1 million as compared to $817.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in admissions revenue primarily relates to a decline in attendance of 1.2 million guests, or 5.5%. Attendance in 2017 was primarily impacted by a decline in U.S. domestic and international attendance, largely concentrated at our parks in Orlando and San Diego. In addition, SeaWorld San Diego was further impacted by a decline in attendance from the Southern California market. We believe the decline in U.S. domestic attendance, particularly in Orlando, results primarily from the combined impact of reduced national advertising and competitive pressures. Among other factors, we believe the decline in attendance at our SeaWorld San Diego park partly results from public perception issues, which resurfaced since we reduced marketing spend on our national reputation campaign. Admission per capita decreased by 1.0% to $36.79 in 2017 from $37.17 in 2016. The decrease results primarily from the mix of guests, including a higher mix of season pass attendance and free promotional ticket offerings. These factors were partially offset by price increases in our admission products. Food, merchandise and other revenue . Food, merchandise and other revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased $28.2 million, or 5.4% to $498.3 million as compared to $526.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to a decline in attendance. In-park per capita spending increased slightly by 0.1%, to $23.96 in 2017 from $23.93 in 2016. Costs of food, merchandise and other revenues. Costs of food, merchandise and other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased $4.7 million, or 4.7%, to $95.9 million as compared to $100.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to a decline in related revenues. These costs represent 19.3% and 19.1% of related revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 44 Operating expenses . Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $34.7 million, or 4.7% to $702.1 million as compared to $736.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease primarily relates to a decline of approximately $17.8 million in labor costs partly related to other cost savings initiatives which included a reduction in headcount, a decline of approximately $4.0 million in equity compensation expense and a reduction in other costs due to cost savings initiatives. These factors were partially offset by an increase of in asset write-offs and impairments primarily related to $7.8 milli on of impairment of certain long-lived assets in 2017 compared to asset write-offs of $6.4 million in 2016 associated with a canceled project (see Note 8–Property and Equipment, Net, in our notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). The decrease in equity compensation expense largely related to $9.0 million of incremental expense in the first quarter of 2016 associated with certain performance-vesting restricted shares which vested on April 1, 201 6 compared to incremental equity compensation expense recorded in the second quarter of 2017 of $2.8 million associated with certain performance-vesting restricted shares which partially vested on May 8, 2017 (see Note 19–Equity-Based Compensation to our c onsolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K ). Operating expenses were 55.6% of total revenues in 2017 compared to 54.8% in 2016. Selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $9.7 million, or 4.1% to $228.8 million as compared to $238.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease primarily relates to a decline in equity compensation expense of $10.3 million. The decline in equity compensation expense largely relates to $18.5 million of incremental expense in the first quarter of 2016 associated with certain performance-vesting restricted shares which vested on April 1, 2016 compared to incremental equity compensation expense recorded in the second quarter of 2017 of $5.6 million associated with certain performance-vesting restricted shares which partially vested on May 8, 2017 (see Note 19–Equity-Based Compensation to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). In addition to the decrease in equity compensation expense, selling, general and administrative expenses also decreased due to a reduction in barter expense in 2017 and a decrease in labor costs due to a reduction in headcount. These factors were partially offset by an increase in other professional expenses primarily related to legal costs. As a percentage of total revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses were 18.1% in 2017 compared to 17.7% in 2016. Goodwill impairment charge . The goodwill impairment charge for the year ended December 31, 2017 relates to the full impairment of the goodwill for our SeaWorld Orlando reporting unit. Due to financial performance, particularly late in the second quarter of 2017 which was driven primarily by a decline in U.S. domestic and international attendance in the Orlando market, we determined a triggering event had occurred that required an interim goodwill impairment test for our SeaWorld Orlando reporting unit. See Note 9–Goodwill, Net to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Restructuring and other separation costs. Restructuring and other separation costs of $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 represent severance and other termination benefits associated with certain positions which were eliminated in the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of the 2017 Restructuring Program. Restructuring and other separation costs of $9.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 relates to severance and other related expenses primarily associated with certain positions eliminated in 2016 as a result of the 2016 Restructuring Program announced in December 2016. See Note 21–Restructuring Programs and Other Separation Costs to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $36.4 million, or 18.2% to $163.3 million as compared to $199.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease is primarily related to $33.7 million in accelerated deprecation incurred in the first half of 2016 due to the disposal of deep-water lifting floors from our orca habitats (see Note 8–Property and Equipment, Net, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). The remaining decrease relates to the impact of asset retirements and fully depreciated assets, partially offset by new asset additions. Interest expense. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased $15.3 million, or 24.5% to $78.0 million as compared to $62.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase primarily relates to increased LIBOR rates and the impact of Amendment No. 8 to our Senior Secured Credit Facilities entered into on March 31, 2017 along with the impact of interest rate swap agreements which became effective in September of 2016 and fixed the interest on $1.0 billion of our variable-rate long-term debt at a higher rate of 2.45%. See Note 12 –Long-Term Debt to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the “ Our Indebtedness ” section which follows for further details. Loss on early extinguishment of debt and write-off of discounts and debt issuance costs. Loss on early extinguishment of debt and write-off of discounts and debt issuance costs of $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily relates to a write-off of discounts and debt issuance costs resulting from Amendment No. 8 to our Senior Secured Credit Facilities entered into on March 31, 2017. See Note 12–Long-Term Debt to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the “ Our Indebtedness” section which follows for further details. 45 (Benefit from) provision for income taxes . Benefit from income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $85.0 million compared to a provision of $9.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2016. The change primarily resulted from a larger pretax loss in 2017 compared to 2016 and was also impacted by a decrease in the estimated annual effective tax rate. Our consolidated effective tax rate was 2 9.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to (-291.5) % for the year ended December 31, 2016. For 2017, the effective tax rate was reduced for nondeductible equity-based compensation, remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities for enacte d changes in tax laws, the goodwill impairment charge and change in valuation allowance related to the realizability of state net operating loss carryforwards. Our effective income tax rate in 2016 differs from the statutory federal income tax rate primar ily due to permanent items, the majority of which relates to nondeductible equity-based compensation that was recorded in the first quarter of 2016 due to certain performance-vesting restricted shares, which vested on April 1, 2016, the revaluation of cert ain state net operating loss carryforwards as a result of a restructuring and state income taxes. See Note 14–Income Taxes in our notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Our principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations, funds from borrowings and existing cash on hand. Our principal uses of cash include the funding of working capital obligations, debt service, investments in theme parks (including capital projects), and could also include share repurchases or common stock dividends. As of December 31, 2018, we had a working capital ratio (defined as current assets divided by current liabilities) of 0.5, due in part to a significant deferred revenue balance from revenues paid in advance for our theme park admissions products and high turnover of in-park products that results in a limited inventory balance. We typically operate with a working capital ratio less than 1 and we expect that we will continue to do so in the future. Our cash flow from operations, along with our revolving credit facilities, have allowed us to meet our liquidity needs. As market conditions warrant and subject to our contractual restrictions and liquidity position, we, our affiliates and/or our stockholders, may from time to time purchase our outstanding equity and/or debt securities, including our outstanding bank loans in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Any such purchases may be funded by incurring new debt, including additional borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, as defined. Any new debt may also be secured debt. We may also use available cash on our balance sheet. The amounts involved in any such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. Further, since some of our debt may trade at a discount to the face amount among current or future syndicate members, any such purchases may result in our acquiring and retiring a substantial amount of any particular series, with the attendant reduction in the trading liquidity of any such series. Depending on conditions in the credit and capital markets and other factors, we will, from time to time, consider other financing transactions, the proceeds of which could be used to refinance our indebtedness or for other purposes. Share Repurchases In 2014, our Board authorized a share repurchase program of up to $250.0 million of our common stock (the “Share Repurchase Program”). Under the Share Repurchase Program, we are authorized to repurchase shares through open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans and under Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. The Share Repurchase Program has no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued completely at any time. Pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program, during the year ended December 31, 2018, we repurchased a total of 3,654,816 shares of common stock at a total cost of approximately $98.0 million, leaving approximately $92.0 million available as of December 31, 2018. All of the common stock is held as treasury shares at December 31, 2018. On February 22, 2019, our Board authorized a replenishment to the Share Repurchase Program of $158.0 million, bringing the total amount authorized for future share repurchases to $250.0 million. The number of shares to be purchased and the timing of purchases will be based on our trading windows and available liquidity, general business and market conditions and other factors, including legal requirements and alternative opportunities. See Note 20–Stockholders’ Equity in our notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on the Share Repurchase Program. Dividends We do not currently pay a dividend. Prior to September 19, 2016, our Board of Directors (the “Board”) had a policy to pay, subject to legally available funds, a regular quarterly dividend. In September 2016, the Board suspended the Company’s quarterly dividend policy to allow greater flexibility to deploy capital, to opportunities that offer the greatest long-term returns to shareholders such as, but not limited to, share repurchases, investments in new attractions or debt repayments. Future dividends, if any, and the timing of declaration of any such dividends, will be at the discretion of the Board and will depend upon many factors, including, but not limited to, our results of operations, financial condition, level of indebtedness, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, restrictions in our debt agreements and in any preferred stock, business prospects and other factors that the Board deems relevant. 46 For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, accumulated dividends of $0.3 million and $1.5 million were paid, respectively, primarily related to shares that carried dividend rights which vested during the respective year. For the ye ar ended December 31, 2016, dividends paid to stockholders were $65.3 million and primarily related to dividend declarations declared prior to the dividend suspension. See Note 19–Equity-Based Compensation and Note 20–Stockholders’ Equity to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details and the “– Covenant Compliance ” section which follows for further details on covenants that could restrict our ability to make certain restricted payments, including dividend payments and share repurchases. Other As of December 31, 2018, we have five interest rate swap agreements (“the Interest Rate Swap Agreements”) which effectively fix the interest rate on the LIBOR-indexed interest payments associated with $1.0 billion of SEA’s outstanding long-term debt. The Interest Rate Swap Agreements became effective on September 30, 2016; have a total notional amount of $1.0 billion; and mature on May 14, 2020. See Note 12–Long-Term Debt and Note 13–Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. We believe that existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations, and available borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities will be adequate to meet the capital expenditures, dividends and working capital requirements of our operations for at least the next 12 months. The following table presents a summary of our cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 293,935 $ 192,457 $ 280,412 Net cash used in investing activities (180,029 ) (170,873 ) (160,518 ) Net cash used in financing activities (112,896 ) (56,965 ) (70,139 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash $ 1,010 $ (35,381 ) $ 49,755 Cash Flows from Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $293.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $192.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities largely related to an increase in revenue in 2018, resulting primarily from an increase in attendance. Net cash provided by operating activities was $192.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $280.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities largely related to a decrease in revenue in 2017, resulting primarily from a decline in attendance, and an increase in interest paid, partially offset by a decline in expenses when compared to the prior year. Cash Flows from Investing Activities Investing activities consist principally of capital investments we make in our theme parks for future attractions and infrastructure. Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of $179.8 million largely related to future attractions. Net cash used in investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 consisted primarily of capital expenditures of $172.5 million and $160.5 million, respectively, largely related to attractions which opened in 2018 and 2017. The amount of our capital expenditures may be affected by general economic and financial conditions, among other things, including restrictions imposed by our borrowing arrangements. We generally expect to fund our 2019 capital expenditures through our operating cash flow. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to $98.0 million used for share repurchases, net repayments on long-term debt of $21.7 million and $8.1 million of debt issuance costs paid in connection with the Amended Credit Agreement to our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, as defined below, offset by a net draw of $15.0 million on our Revolving Credit Facility. See Note 12–Long-Term Debt to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. 47 Net cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to net repayments on long-term debt of $28.6 million, $15.4 million of debt issuance costs paid in connection with Amendment No. 8 to our S enior Secured Credit Facilities, as defined below, and net repayments of $9.4 million on our revolving credit facility. See Note 12–Long-Term Debt to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further de tails. Net cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily attributable to $65.3 million in cash dividends paid to common stockholders and $12.6 million paid on our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, as defined below, which was offset by a net draw on our Revolving Credit Facility of $9.4 million. Our Indebtedness The Company is a holding company and conducts its operations through its subsidiaries, which have incurred or guaranteed indebtedness as described below. Senior Secured Credit Facilities SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc. (“SEA”) is the borrower under our senior secured credit facilities (the “Senior Secured Credit Facilities”) pursuant to a credit agreement dated as of December 1, 2009, by and among SEA, as borrower, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, collateral agent, letter of credit issuer and swing line lender and the other agents and lenders party thereto, as the same may be amended, restated, supplemented or modified from time to time. On March 31, 2017, SEA entered into a refinancing amendment, Amendment No. 8 (the “Amendment No. 8”), to the existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities and on October 31, 2018, SEA entered into another refinancing amendment, Amendment No. 9 with SEA as the borrower, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as successor administrative agent, successor collateral agent, L/C issuer and swing line lender and the other agents and lenders from time to time (the “Amended Credit Agreement”), to the existing Senior Secured Credit Facilities. On October 31, 2018, in connection with the Amended Credit Agreement, SEA borrowed $543.9 million of additional term loans (the “Additional Term B-5 Loans”) of which the proceeds, along with cash on hand, were used to redeem all of the then outstanding principal of the Term B-2 Loans, with a principal amount equal to $543.9 million, and pay other fees, costs and expenses in connection with the Amended Credit Agreement and related transactions. Additionally, pursuant to the Amended Credit Agreement, SEA terminated the existing revolving credit commitments and replaced them with a new tranche of revolving credit commitments with an aggregate commitment amount of $210.0 million (the “New Revolving Credit Facility”) with a maturity date of October 31, 2023. Subsequent to December 31, 2018, SEA borrowed an additional $45.0 million under the New Revolving Credit Facility for general working capital purposes. As of December 31, 2018, our Senior Secured Credit Facilities consisted of $1.523 billion in Term B-5 Loans which will mature on March 31, 2024, along with a $210.0 million New Revolving Credit Facility, of which $30.0 million was drawn upon as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, SEA had approximately $21.3 million of outstanding letters of credit, leaving approximately $158.7 million available for borrowing under the New Revolving Credit Facility. See Note 12–Long-Term Debt to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. Covenant Compliance As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all covenants in the credit agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The Amended Credit Agreement removed all financial covenants on the Term B-5 Loans. The New Revolving Credit Facility requires that SEA comply with a springing maximum first lien secured leverage ratio of 6.25x to be tested as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, solely to the extent that on such date the aggregate amount of funded loans and letters of credit (excluding undrawn letters of credit in an amount not to exceed $30.0 million and cash collateralized letters of credit) under the New Revolving Credit Facility exceeds an amount equal to 35% of the then outstanding commitments under the New Revolving Credit Facility. Additionally, the definition of Adjusted EBITDA was amended to include the following items which had previously been added back on a limited basis: (i) add-backs of certain unusual items on a pre-tax basis which were previously added back on an after-tax basis only and (ii) unlimited add-backs primarily related to business optimization, development and strategic initiative costs which were previously limited to $15.0 million in any fiscal year. The Amended Credit Agreement also replaces the previous $10.0 million limitation on estimated cost savings with a limitation of 25% of the latest twelve months Adjusted EBITDA, calculated before estimated cost savings and increases the realization limit for estimated cost savings, operating expense reductions and synergies to 18 months. 48 As of December 31, 2018, the total leverage ratio as calculated under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 3.58 to 1.00. The Company’s total leverage ratio is calculated by dividing total net debt by th e last twelve months Adjusted EBITDA plus $23.4 million in estimated cost savings which have been identified based on certain specified actions the Company has taken, including restructurings and cost savings initiatives. See Note 12–Long-Term Debt to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. Adjusted EBITDA We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate as it eliminates the effect of certain non-cash and other items not necessarily indicative of a company’s underlying operating performance. The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA provides additional information to investors about the calculation of, and compliance with, certain financial covenants and other relevant metrics in the credit agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Adjusted EBITDA is a material component of these covenants. We use Adjusted EBITDA in connection with certain components of our executive compensation program. In addition, investors, lenders, financial analysts and rating agencies have historically used EBITDA related measures in our industry, along with other measures, to estimate the value of a company, to make informed investment decisions and to evaluate companies in the industry. Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized term under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for a measure of our financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and is not indicative of income from operations as determined under GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP financial measures have limitations which should be considered before using these measures to evaluate our financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA, as presented by us, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to varying methods of calculation. The following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement, to net income (loss) for the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 (In thousands) Net income (loss) $ 44,788 $ (202,386 ) $ (12,531 ) Provision for (benefit from) income taxes 17,915 (85,006 ) 9,330 Loss on early extinguishment of debt and write-off of discounts and debt issuance costs (a) 8,150 8,143 — Interest expense 80,914 78,001 62,661 Depreciation and amortization 160,955 163,294 199,649 Goodwill impairment charge (b) — 269,332 — Equity-based compensation expense (c) 22,152 23,203 37,515 Loss on impairment or disposal of assets (d) 18,862 12,431 9,382 Business optimization, development and strategic initiative costs (e) 29,460 17,473 15,566 Certain investment costs and franchise taxes (f) 3,353 1,082 183 Other adjusting items (g) 14,730 11,784 382 Adjusted EBITDA (h) 401,279 297,351 322,137 Items added back to Adjusted EBITDA, after cost savings, as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement: Estimated cost savings (i) 23,400 10,000 10,000 Adjusted EBITDA, after cost savings (j) $ 424,679 $ 307,351 $ 332,137 49 Prior to the Amended Credit Agreement, the credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facilities limited the amount of certain add-backs as described in footnotes (e) and (g) below. The Adjusted EBITDA for all periods presented above reflects the current definitions in the Amended Credit Agreement. The following table reconciles the Adjusted EBITDA calculation as previously defined prior to the Amended Credit Agreement to the Adjusted EBITDA calculation as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement. This table is presented as supplemental information only: For the Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 (In thousands) Adjusted EBITDA (as previously defined) $ 394,349 $ 300,843 $ 331,988 Certain expenses over previous credit agreement limit (e) 14,460 2,473 — Taxes related to other adjusting items not previously added back (g) 2,470 4,035 149 Estimated cost savings (i) (10,000 ) (10,000 ) (10,000 ) Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) (h) 401,279 297,351 322,137 Items added back to Adjusted EBITDA, after cost savings, as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement: Estimated cost savings (i) 23,400 10,000 10,000 Adjusted EBITDA, after cost savings (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) (j) $ 424,679 $ 307,351 $ 332,137 (a) Reflects a loss on early extinguishment of debt and write-off of discounts and debt issuance costs associated with 2018 and 2017 amendments to our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, respectively. See Note 12–Long-Term Debt to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. (b) Reflects a non-cash goodwill impairment charge recorded in the year ended December 31, 2017 related to the full impairment of goodwill for the Company’s SeaWorld Orlando reporting unit during the second quarter of 2017. See Note 9–Goodwill, Net, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. (c) Reflects non-cash compensation expenses associated with the grants of equity compensation. For the year ended December 31, 2018, includes approximately $5.5 million, related to equity awards which were accelerated in connection with the departure of certain executives, as required by their respective employment agreements. For the year ended December 31, 2017, includes $8.4 million associated with certain performance-vesting shares, a portion of which vested upon the closing of the ZHG Transaction on May 8, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2016, includes $27.5 million associated with certain performance-vesting shares, which vested on April 1, 2016. See Note 19–Equity-Based Compensation to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. (d) Reflects primarily non-cash expenses related to fixed asset disposals and impairments, including: (i) approximately $10.9 million associated with certain rides and equipment which were removed from service during the year ended December 31, 2018; (ii) a loss of approximately $7.8 million related to an amended agreement for the year ended December 31, 2017; and (iii) approximately $6.4 million associated with a canceled project for the year ended December 31, 2016. See Note 8–Property and Equipment, Net, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. (e) For the year ended December 31, 2018, business optimization, development and other strategic initiative costs incurred related to: (i) $17.4 million of severance and other employment costs which primarily includes costs associated with the departure of certain executives during 2018 and costs related to the 2018 Restructuring Program (see Note 21–Restructuring Programs and Other Separation Costs in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details); (ii) $10.7 million of third party consulting costs; and (iii) $1.4 million of product and intellectual property development costs. For the year ended December 31, 2017, business optimization, development and other strategic initiative costs incurred related to: (i) $5.2 million of severance and other employment costs associated with the 2017 Restructuring Program (see Note 21–Restructuring Programs and Other Separation Costs in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details); (ii) $7.2 million of third party consulting and legal costs; (iii) $4.5 million of product and intellectual property development costs; and (iv) net costs of $0.6 million incurred for certain positions eliminated not related to a formal restructuring program or cost saving initiative. For the year ended December 31, 2016, business optimization, development and other strategic initiative costs incurred related to: (i) $10.1 million of severance and other employment costs which primarily includes costs associated with the 2016 Restructuring Program (see Note 21–Restructuring Programs and Other Separation Costs in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details); (ii) $2.3 million of third party consulting costs; and (iii) $3.2 million of product and intellectual property development costs. 50 Prior to the Amended Credit Agreement, due to limitations under the credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the amount which the Company was able to add back to Adjusted EBITDA for these costs, was limited to $15.0 million in any fiscal year. As such, the Adjusted EBITDA calculation for the year ended December 31, 2017 previously reported did not reflect approximately $2.5 million of related costs due to these limitations. (f) For the year ended December 31, 2018, reflects primarily a loss of approximately $2.8 million relating to expenses incurred and fees associated with the termination of an agreement. See Note 15–Commitments and Contingencies in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. (g) Reflects the impact of expenses incurred primarily related to certain legal matters, which we are permitted to exclude under the credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facilities due to the unusual nature of the items. For the year ended December 31, 2018, includes $12.1 million related to legal settlements and $5.1 million in legal fees which were partially offset by approximately $2.5 million of insurance recoveries received related to these legal matters. See Note 15–Commitments and Contingencies in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. Prior to the Amended Credit Agreement, these items were excluded on an after-tax basis only, as such, the Adjusted EBITDA calculation for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 previously reported did not reflect related taxes of approximately $4.0 million and $0.1 million, respectively. (h) Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted to exclude certain non-cash, and other items permitted in calculating covenant compliance under the credit agreement governing the Company’s Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The Adjusted EBITDA presentation for the prior periods has been changed to conform with the changes made to its definition in the Amended Credit Agreement. Prior to the Amended Credit Agreement, the credit agreement governing our Senior Secured Credit Facilities limited the amount of certain add-backs as described in footnotes (e) and (g) above. (i) The Senior Secured Credit Facilities permits the Company’s calculation of certain covenants to be based on Adjusted EBITDA, as defined above, for the last twelve month period further adjusted for net annualized estimated savings the Company expects to realize over the following 18 month period related to certain specified actions, including restructurings and cost savings initiatives. These estimated savings are calculated net of the amount of actual benefits realized during such period. These estimated savings are a non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA add-back item only as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement and does not impact the Company’s reported GAAP net income (loss). The Amended Credit Agreement limits the amount of such estimated savings which may be reflected to 25% of Adjusted EBITDA, calculated for the last twelve months before the impact of these estimated cost savings. Prior to the Amended Credit Agreement, the credit agreement limited the amount of such estimated savings which could be reflected in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA to $10.0 million for any four consecutive fiscal quarters calculated as the amount the Company expected to realize over the following 12 month period. (j) The Senior Secured Credit Facilities permits the Company’s calculation of certain covenants to be based on Adjusted EBITDA, as defined above, for the last twelve month period further adjusted for net annualized estimated savings as described in footnote (i) above. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018: Total Less than 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years More than 5 Years (In thousands) Long-term debt (including current portion) (a) $ 1,553,389 $ 45,505 $ 31,010 $ 31,010 $ 1,445,864 Interest on long-term debt (b) 456,504 88,293 173,537 173,409 21,265 Operating and capital leases (c) 334,880 16,809 27,736 22,307 268,028 Purchase obligations and license commitments (d) 291,470 139,194 141,942 2,067 8,267 Total contractual obligations $ 2,636,243 $ 289,801 $ 374,225 $ 228,793 $ 1,743,424 Represents principal payments on the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and New Revolving Credit Facility.

(c) Represents commitments under long-term operating and capital leases requiring annual minimum lease payments, primarily consisting of the lease for the land of our SeaWorld theme park in San Diego, California. 51 (d) We have minimum purchase commitments with various vendors th rough 2031. Outstanding minimum purchase commitments consist primarily of capital expenditures related to future attractions, infrastructure enhancements for existing facilities and information technology products and services. Amounts have been calculated using early termination fees or non-cancelable minimum contractual obligations by period, as applicable, under contracts that were in effect as of December 31, 2018. In addition, in connection with the Sesame License Agreement, we have also committed to t he following: (i) opening a new Sesame Place theme park no later than mid-2021 in a location to be determined within the Sesame Territory; (ii) building a new Sesame Land in SeaWorld Orlando by fall 2022; (iii) investing in minimum annual capital and marke ting thresholds; and (iv) providing support for agreed upon sponsorship and charitable initiatives, including Sesame’s annual gala event. As a result, obligations related to this agreement are included in the table above. For further details, refer to Note 15–Commitments and Contingencies in our notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K . Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2018. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingencies during the reporting period. Significant estimates and assumptions include the valuation and useful lives of long-lived tangible and intangible assets, the valuation of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, the accounting for income taxes, the accounting for self-insurance and revenue recognition. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies which require management’s most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. For more discussion of these and other significant accounting policies, refer to Note 2–Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets All long-lived assets, including property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Assets are grouped and tested at the lowest level for which identifiable, independent cash flows are available. The impairment indicators considered important that may trigger an impairment review, if significant, include the following: • underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results; • changes in the manner of use, sale or disposal of assets; • decreases in the market value of assets; • adverse change in legal factors or business climate; and • other macroeconomic conditions. An impairment loss may be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset, including disposition, are less than the carrying value of the asset. The measurement of the impairment loss to be recognized is based upon the difference between the fair value and the carrying amounts of the assets. Fair value is generally determined based upon a discounted cash flow analysis. In order to determine if an asset has been impaired, the determination of both undiscounted and discounted future cash flows requires management to make significant estimates and consider an anticipated course of action as of the balance sheet date. Subsequent changes in estimated undiscounted and discounted future cash flows arising from changes in anticipated actions could impact the determination of whether impairment exists. Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually, and as of an interim date should factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim test, for ongoing recoverability based on applicable reporting unit performance and consideration of significant events or changes in the overall business environment. Such events or changes in the overall business environment could include, but are not limited to, significant negative trends or unanticipated changes in the competitive or macroeconomic environment. 52 In assessing goodwill for impairment, we may choose to initially evaluate qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. We consider several factors, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance of the reporting unit, changes in management, strategy or customers, and releva nt reporting unit specific events such as a change in the carrying amount of net assets, a more-likely-than-not expectation of selling or disposing all, or a portion, of a reporting unit, and the testing of recoverability of a significant asset group withi n a reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment is not conclusive, then the impairment analysis for goodwill is performed at the reporting unit level. We may also choose to perform this quantitative impairment analysis instead of the qualitative analysis . The quantitative impairment analysis compares the fair value of the reporting unit, determined using the income and/or market approach, to its recorded amount. If the recorded amount exceeds the fair value, then a goodwill impairment charge is recorded for the difference up to the recorded amount of goodwill. Significant judgments required in this testing process may include projecting future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions. Projections are based on management’s best estimates given recent financial performance, market trends, strategic plans and other available information which in recent years have been materially accurate. Although not currently anticipated, changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value or impairment. It is possible that our assumptions about future performance, as well as the economic outlook and related conclusions regarding the valuation of our assets, could change adversely, which may result in impairment that would have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations in future periods. Goodwill 2017 Interim Impairment Test — In 2017, due to financial performance particularly late in the second quarter of 2017 at our SeaWorld Orlando park, we determined a triggering event occurred that required an interim goodwill impairment test for our SeaWorld Orlando reporting unit. Based on the results of the interim goodwill impairment test, we determined that the SeaWorld Orlando reporting unit goodwill was fully impaired and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $269.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. Fair value for the SeaWorld Orlando reporting unit was determined using the income approach. A key assumption utilized in the goodwill analysis was a weighted average cost of capital of 9%. Goodwill Annual Impairment Tests —At December 1, 2018 and 2017, a qualitative assessment was performed on our remaining goodwill, which relates only to our Discovery Cove reporting unit, and we concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that goodwill was not impaired. Our other indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of certain trade names/trademarks and other intangible assets which, after considering legal, regulatory, contractual, and other competitive and economic factors, are determined to have indefinite lives and are valued using the relief from royalty method. Currently, trade names/trademarks are combined by brand as a unit of accounting when testing for impairment as the brand represents the highest and best use of the asset and drives our marketing strategy and international license agreements. Significant estimates required in this valuation method include estimated future revenues impacted by the trade names/trademarks, royalty rates, and appropriate discount rates. Projections are based on management’s best estimates given recent financial performance, market trends, strategic plans, brand awareness, operating characteristics by park, and other available information, which in recent years have been materially accurate. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the fair value determination used in the assessment of impairment. Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets 2017 Interim Impairment Test —In 2017, an interim impairment assessment of certain trade names/trademarks with a combined balance of $93.0 million related to the SeaWorld brand was performed and we calculated that the estimated fair value of the trade names/trademarks exceeded their carrying values. Key assumptions utilized in the analysis were a discount rate of 11.0% and an estimated royalty rate of 3%. Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Annual Impairment Tests —At December 1, 2018 we performed a qualitative assessment of our trade names/trademarks on a combined basis by brand and concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that our trade names/trademarks were not impaired as the estimated fair value of trade names/trademarks were substantially in excess of their carrying values. At December 1, 2017, we performed either a qualitative or quantitative assessment of our trade names/trademarks on a combined basis by brand and concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that our trade names/trademarks were not impaired as the estimated fair value of trade names/trademarks were substantially in excess of their carrying values. For the December 1, 2017 quantitative assessment associated with the SeaWorld brand, we calculated that the estimated fair value of the combined trade names/trademarks exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin. Key assumptions utilized in the analysis were a discount rate of 12% and an estimated royalty rate of 3%. 53 Accounting for Income Taxes We are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation periods for property and equipment and deferred revenue, for tax and financial accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our consolidated balance sheets. We must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets (primarily net operating loss and charitable contribution carryforwards) will be recovered from future taxable income. To the extent that we believe that recovery is not more likely than not, a valuation allowance against those amounts is recorded. To the extent that we record a valuation allowance or a change in the valuation allowance during a period, we recognize these amounts as income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) contains rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change, which is generally any change in ownership of more than 50% of its stock over a rolling three-year period, to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards in years after the ownership change. These rules generally operate by focusing on ownership shifts among stockholders owning directly or indirectly 5% or more of the stock of a company and any change in ownership arising from shares of stock sold by these same stockholders. Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision or benefit for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets. Management has analyzed all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard in assessing the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred income tax assets. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of the statutory carryback and carryforward periods and tax planning alternatives. The assumptions about future taxable income require the use of significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying business. Due to the uncertainty of realizing the benefit from the deferred tax asset recorded for certain state net operating loss carryforwards, we have recorded a valuation allowance of $2.8 million, net of federal tax benefit, on the deferred tax assets related to state net operating losses as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. We believe it is more likely than not that the benefit from these state net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized. During the three months ended June 30, 2017, an ownership shift of more than 50 percent as defined by the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) Section 382 occurred. We determined that, while an ownership shift occurred and limits were determined under Section 382 and the regulations and guidance thereunder, the applicable limits would not impair the value or anticipated use of our federal and state net operating losses. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that any limitation under IRC Section 382 will not impair the realizability of the deferred income tax assets related to federal and state tax net operating loss carryforwards. Any future ownership change may, however, result in further limitations imposed by Section 382. Any such limitation may have the effect of reducing our after-tax cash flow in future years and may affect our need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets related to federal and state net operating loss carryforwards. Self-Insurance Reserves Reserves are recorded for the estimated amounts of guest and employee claims and expenses incurred each period that are not covered by insurance. Reserves are established for both identified claims and incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) claims. Such amounts are accrued for when claim amounts become probable and estimable. Reserves for identified claims are based upon our own historical claims experience and third-party estimates of settlement costs. Reserves for IBNR claims are based upon our own claims data history, as well as industry averages. All reserves are periodically reviewed for changes in facts and circumstances and adjustments are made as necessary. Revenue Recognition Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”), Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , using the modified retrospective transition method. The adoption of ASC 606 did not have a material impact on our existing or new contracts as of January 1, 2018; therefore, no cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings was required as a result of adoption. We primarily generate revenue from admission into our parks and from the sale of food, merchandise and other in-park products. 54 Admissions revenue consists of sing le-day tickets, annual or season passes or other multi-day or multi-park admission products. Admission products with similar characteristics are analyzed using a portfolio approach for each separate park. For single-day tickets, we recognize revenue at a point in time, upon admission to the park. Annual passes, season passes or other multi-day or multi-park passes allow guests access to specific parks over a specified time period. For these pass and multi-use products, revenue is deferred and recognized o ver the terms of the admission product based on estimated redemption rates for similar products and is adjusted periodically. We estimate a redemption rate using historical and forecasted growth rates and attendance trends by park for similar products. At tendance trends factor in seasonality and are adjusted based on actual trends periodically. Revenue is recognized on a pro-rata basis based on the estimated allocated selling price of the admission product. For multi-day admission products, revenue is allo cated based on the number of visits included in the pass and recognized ratably based on each admission into the theme park. Deferred revenue includes a current and long-term portion, which primarily consists of deferred revenue associated with our intern ational agreement. Food, merchandise and other revenue primarily consists of culinary, merchandise and other in-park products and also includes other miscellaneous revenue which is not significant in the periods presented, including revenue related to our international agreements. We recognize revenue for food, merchandise and other in-park products when the related products or services are received by our guests. Certain admission products may also include bundled products at the time of purchase, such as culinary or merchandise items. We conduct an analysis of bundled products to identify separate distinct performance obligations that are material in the context of the contract. For those products that are determined to be distinct performance obligations and material in the context of the contract, we allocate a portion of the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation using each performance obligation’s standalone price. If the bundled product is related to a pass product and offered over time, revenue will be recognized over time accordingly. We have also entered into agreements with certain external theme park, zoo and other attraction operators to jointly market and sell single and multi-use admission products. These joint products allow admission to both a Company park and an external park, zoo or other attraction. The agreements with the external partners specify the allocation of revenue to Company parks from any jointly sold products. Whether the Company or the external partner sells the product, our portion of revenue is deferred until the first time the product is redeemed at one of our parks and recognized over its related use in a manner consistent with our admission products. In addition, we barter theme park admission products and sponsorship opportunities for advertising, employee recognition awards, and various other services. The fair value of the products or services is recognized into admissions revenue and related expenses at the time of the exchange and approximates the estimated fair value of the goods received or provided, whichever is more readily determinable. Recently Issued Financial Accounting Standards Refer to Note 3–Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in our notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Inflation The impact of inflation has affected, and will continue to affect, our operations significantly. Our costs of food, merchandise and other revenues are influenced by inflation and fluctuations in global commodity prices. In addition, costs for construction, repairs and maintenance are all subject to inflationary pressures. Interest Rate Risk We are exposed to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates, and to a lesser extent on currency exchange rates, from time to time, on imported rides and equipment. The objective of our financial risk management is to reduce the potential negative impact of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to acceptable levels. We do not acquire market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes. We manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed-rate long-term debt and interest rate swaps that fix a portion of our variable-rate long-term debt. The changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on our variable-rate debt. During the next 12 months, our estimate is that an additional $2.5 million will be reclassified as a reduction of interest expense. 55 After considering the impact of interest rate swap agreements, at December 31, 2018, approximately $1.0 billion of our outstanding long-term debt represents fixed -rate debt and approximately $523.4 million represents variable-rate debt. Assuming an average balance on our revolving credit borrowings of approximately $40.0 million, a hypothetical 100 bps increase in one month LIBOR on our variable-rate debt would lea d to an increase of approximately $5.6 million in annual cash interest costs due to the impact of our fixed-rate swap agreements. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto are provided in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), require public companies, including us, to maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” which are defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act to mean a company’s controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required or necessary disclosures. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. The design of any controls and procedures also is based on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation and subject to the foregoing, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to accomplish their objectives at a reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Regulations under the Exchange Act require public companies, including our Company, to evaluate any change in our “internal control over financial reporting” as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2018 that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting As required by the SEC’s rules and regulations for the implementation of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company, (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors, and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements in our consolidated financial statements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 56 Management assessed the effectiveness of th e Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018. In making these assessments, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control — Integra ted Framework (2013) . Based on our assessments and those criteria, management determined that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018. Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued a report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28, 2019, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Tampa, Florida February 28, 2019 We have served as the Company's auditor since 2009. F-2 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the stockholders and the Board of Directors of SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 of the Company and our report dated February 28, 2019, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Tampa, Florida February 28, 2019 F-3 SEAWOR LD ENTERTAINMENT, INC.

F-7 SEAWORLD ENTERTAINMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc., through its wholly-owned subsidiary, SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc. (“SEA”) (collectively, the “Company”), owns and operates twelve theme parks within the United States. Prior to December 1, 2009, the Company did not have any operations. On December 1, 2009, the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity interest of Busch Entertainment LLC and affiliates from Anheuser Busch Companies, Inc. and Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (“ABI”). At that time, the Company was owned by ten limited partnerships, ultimately controlled by affiliates of The Blackstone Group L.P. (“Blackstone”) and certain co-investors. The Company completed an initial public offering in April 2013. On May 8, 2017 an affiliate of Zhonghong Zhuoye Group Co., Ltd. (“ZHG Group”), Sun Wise (UK) Co., LTD (“ZHG”) acquired approximately 21% of the then outstanding shares of common stock of the Company (the “ZHG Transaction”) from certain affiliates of Blackstone (the “Seller”), pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement between ZHG and Seller (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”). Subsequent to the ZHG Transaction, Blackstone did not own any remaining shares of the Company. See further discussion in Note 17–Related-Party Transactions and Note 19–Equity-Based Compensation. The Company operates SeaWorld theme parks in Orlando, Florida; San Antonio, Texas; and San Diego, California, and Busch Gardens theme parks in Tampa, Florida, and Williamsburg, Virginia. The Company operates water park attractions in Orlando, Florida (Aquatica); San Antonio, Texas (Aquatica); San Diego, California (Aquatica); Tampa, Florida (Adventure Island); and Williamsburg, Virginia (Water Country USA). The Company also operates a reservations-only theme park in Orlando, Florida (Discovery Cove) and a seasonal park in Langhorne, Pennsylvania (Sesame Place). During each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 approximately 57% of the Company’s revenues were generated in the State of Florida. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including SEA. All intercompany accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, the accounting for self-insurance, deferred tax assets and liabilities, deferred revenue, equity compensation and the valuation of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Reclassifications Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the 2018 presentation, in particular the Company reclassified $0.5 million of dividends payable to other accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2017. Also see Note 3–Recent Accounting Pronouncements. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash held at financial institutions as well as operating cash onsite at each theme park to fund daily operations and amounts due from third-party credit card companies with settlement terms of less than four days. The amounts due from third-party credit card companies totaled $17.4 million and $16.8 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The cash balances in all accounts held at financial institutions are insured up to $250,000 by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) through December 31, 2018. At times, cash balances may exceed federally insured amounts and potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk. Management believes that no significant concentration of credit risk exists with respect to these cash balances because of its assessment of the creditworthiness and financial viability of the respective financial institutions. From time to time, the Company may invest in certain highly liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less. These instruments may include money market mutual funds, certificates of deposit or time deposits, among others, which may or may not qualify for FDIC insurance. The Company classifies any such instruments as cash and cash equivalents based on their short-term maturities. F-8 Restricted Cash Restricted cash is recorded in other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Restricted cash consists primarily of funds received from strategic partners for use in approved marketing and promotional activities. December 31, December 31, 2018 2017 (In thousands) Cash and cash equivalents $ 34,073 $ 33,178 Restricted cash, included in other current assets 934 819 Total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 35,007 $ 33,997 Accounts Receivable—Net Accounts receivable are reported at net realizable value and consist primarily of amounts due from customers for the sale of admission products, including amounts due for admissions products purchased on monthly installment arrangements. The Company is not exposed to a significant concentration of credit risk. The Company records an allowance on trade accounts receivable with an offset to the provision for bad debt for estimated uncollectible receivables, based on the amount and status of past-due accounts, contractual terms of the receivables and the Company’s history of uncollectible accounts. For all periods presented, the provision for bad debt was immaterial related to these accounts. The Company also records an allowance on amounts due from monthly installment arrangements based on historical default rates. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded $14.7 million and $9.5 million, respectively, as an allowance on its installment arrangements with a corresponding reduction to deferred revenue. Inventories Inventories are accounted for using the weighted average cost method and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventories consist primarily of products for resale, including merchandise, culinary items and miscellaneous supplies. Obsolete or excess inventories are recorded at their estimated realizable value. Property and Equipment—Net Property and equipment are recorded at cost. The cost of ordinary or routine maintenance, repairs, spare parts and minor renewals is expensed as incurred. Development costs associated with new attractions and products are generally capitalized after necessary feasibility studies have been completed and final concept or contracts have been approved. The cost of assets is depreciated using the straight-line method based on the following estimated useful lives: Land improvements 10-40 years Buildings 5-40 years Rides, attractions and equipment 3-20 years Animals 1-50 years Material costs to purchase animals exhibited in the theme parks are capitalized and amortized over their estimated lives (1-50 years). All costs to maintain animals are expensed as incurred, including in-house animal breeding costs, as they are immaterial to the consolidated financial statements. Construction in process assets consist primarily of new rides, attractions and infrastructure improvements that have not yet been placed in service. These assets are stated at cost and are not depreciated. Once construction of the assets is completed and placed into service, assets are reclassified to the appropriate asset class based on their nature and depreciated in accordance with the useful lives above. Debt interest is capitalized on all active construction projects. Total interest capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $4.2 million, $2.7 million and $2.7 million, respectively. Computer System Development Costs The Company capitalizes computer system development costs that meet established criteria and, once placed in service, amortizes those costs to expense on a straight-line basis over five years. Total capitalized costs related to computer system development costs, net of accumulated amortization, were $6.1 million and $9.2 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and are recorded in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Accumulated amortization was $9.9 million and $16.1 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Amortization expense of capitalized computer system development costs during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $3.7 million, $3.5 million and $3.4 million, respectively, and is recorded in depreciation and amortization in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Systems reengineering costs do not meet the proper criteria for capitalization and are expensed as incurred. F-9 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets All long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. An impairment loss may be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset, including disposition, are less than the carrying value of the asset. The measurement of the impairment loss to be recognized is based upon the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying amounts of the assets. Fair value is generally determined based upon a discounted cash flow analysis. In order to determine if an asset has been impaired, assets are grouped and tested at the lowest level for which identifiable independent cash flows are available (generally a theme park). See Note 8–Property and Equipment for further details. Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but instead reviewed for impairment at least annually on December 1, and as of an interim date should factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim test, with ongoing recoverability based on applicable reporting unit overall financial performance and consideration of significant events or changes in the overall business environment or macroeconomic conditions. Such events or changes in the overall business environment could include, but are not limited to, significant negative trends or unanticipated changes in the competitive or macroeconomic environment. In assessing goodwill for impairment, the Company may choose to initially evaluate qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The Company considers several factors, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance of the reporting unit, changes in management, strategy or customers, and relevant reporting unit specific events such as a change in the carrying amount of net assets, a more likely than not expectation of selling or disposing all, or a portion, of a reporting unit, and the testing of recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment is not conclusive, then a quantitative impairment analysis for goodwill is performed at the reporting unit level. The Company may also choose to perform this quantitative impairment analysis instead of the qualitative analysis. The quantitative impairment analysis compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, determined using the income and/or market approach, to its recorded amount. If the recorded amount exceeds the fair value, then a goodwill impairment charge is recorded for the difference up to the recorded amount of goodwill. The determination of fair value in the Company’s goodwill impairment analysis is based on an estimate of fair value for each reporting unit utilizing known and estimated inputs at the evaluation date. Some of those inputs include, but are not limited to, estimates of future revenue and expense growth, estimated market multiples, expected capital expenditures, income tax rates and cost of invested cap ital. See Note 9–Goodwill, Net, for further details. The Company’s other indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of certain trade names/trademarks and other intangible assets which, after considering legal, regulatory, contractual, and other competitive and economic factors, are determined to have indefinite lives and are valued using the relief from royalty method. Trade names/trademarks are combined by brand as a unit of accounting when testing for impairment as the brand represents the highest and best use of the asset and drives the Company’s marketing strategy and international license agreements. Significant estimates required in this valuation method include estimated future revenues impacted by the trade names/trademarks, royalty rates, and appropriate discount rates. Projections are based on management’s best estimates given recent financial performance, market trends, strategic plans, brand awareness, operating characteristics by park, and other available information. See Note 10–Trade Names/Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets, Net for further details. Other Definite-Lived Intangible Assets The Company’s other intangible assets consist primarily of certain trade names/trademarks, relationships with ticket resellers, a favorable lease asset and a non-compete agreement. These intangible assets are amortized on the straight-line basis over their estimated remaining lives. See Note 10–Trade Names/Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets, Net for further details. Self-Insurance Reserves Reserves are recorded for the estimated amounts of guest and employee claims and expenses incurred each period that are not covered by insurance. Reserves are established for both identified claims and incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) claims. Such amounts are accrued for when claim amounts become probable and estimable. Reserves for identified claims are based upon the Company’s historical claims experience and third-party estimates of settlement costs. Reserves for IBNR claims are based upon the Company’s claims data history, actuarially determined loss development factors and qualitative considerations such as claims management activities. The Company maintains self-insurance reserves for healthcare, auto, general liability and workers compensation claims. Total claims reserves were $31.2 million at December 31, 2018, of which $3.8 million is recorded in accrued salaries, wages and benefits, $6.9 million is recorded in other accrued liabilities and the remaining long-term portion is recorded in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Total claims reserves were $30.6 million at December 31, 2017, of which $2.6 million is recorded in accrued salaries, wages and benefits, $7.1 million is recorded in other accrued liabilities and the remaining long-term portion is recorded in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. All reserves are periodically reviewed for changes in facts and circumstances and adjustments are made as necessary. F-10 Debt Issuance Costs Debt issuance costs are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the related debt and are included in long-term debt, net, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. See further discussion in Note 12–Long-Term Debt. Share Repurchase Program and Treasury Stock From time to time, the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) may authorize share repurchases of common stock. Shares repurchased under Board authorizations are held in treasury for general corporate purposes. The Company accounts for treasury stock on the trade date under the cost method. Treasury stock at December 31, 2018 and 2017 is recorded as a reduction to stockholders’ equity as the Company does not currently intend to retire the treasury stock held. See further discussion of the Company’s share repurchase program in Note 20–Stockholders’ Equity. Revenue Recognition The Company has adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”), Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements within the scope of ASC 606, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contracts with customers; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies the performance obligations. ASC 606 also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts. Admissions Revenue Admissions revenue primarily consists of single-day tickets, annual or season passes or other multi-day or multi-park admission products. As allowed by the practical expedient available to public companies under ASC 606, which the Company adopted, admission products with similar characteristics are analyzed using a portfolio approach for each separate park as the Company expects that the effects on the consolidated financial statements of applying this guidance to the portfolio does not differ materially from applying the guidance to individual contracts within the portfolio. For single-day tickets, the Company recognizes revenue at a point in time, upon admission to the park. Annual passes, season passes or other multi-day or multi-park passes allow guests access to specific parks over a specified time period. For these pass and multi-use products, revenue is deferred and recognized over the terms of the admission product based on estimated redemption rates for similar products and is adjusted periodically. The Company estimates a redemption rate using historical and forecasted growth rates and attendance trends by park for similar products. Attendance trends factor in seasonality and are adjusted based on actual trends periodically. Revenue is recognized on a pro-rata basis based on the estimated allocated selling price of the admission product. For multi-day admission products, revenue is allocated based on the number of visits included in the pass and recognized ratably based on each admission into the theme park. The Company has also entered into agreements with certain external theme park, zoo and other attraction operators to jointly market and sell single and multi-use admission products. These joint products allow admission to both a Company park(s) and an external park, zoo or other attraction. The agreements with the external partners specify the allocation of revenue to Company parks from any jointly sold products. Whether the Company or the external partner sells the product, the Company’s portion of revenue is deferred until the first time the product is redeemed at one of the Company’s parks and recognized over its related use in a manner consistent with the Company’s other admission products. Additionally, the Company barters theme park admission products and sponsorship opportunities for advertising, employee recognition awards, and various other services. The fair value of the products or services is recognized into admissions revenue and related expenses at the time of the exchange and approximates the estimated fair value of the goods or services provided or received, whichever is more readily determinable. Amounts included within admissions revenue with an offset to either selling, general and administrative expenses or operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) related to bartered ticket transactions were $16.6 million, $20.8 million and $29.1 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. In accordance with the practical expedients available to public companies under ASC 606 which the accounting standards provide to simplify compliance, the Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which the Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it has the right to invoice for services performed. Additionally, the Company generally expenses sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). The Company has also elected not to adjust consideration for the effects of financing components in the form of installment purchase plans as the period between when the Company transfers the promised service to the customer and when the customer pays for that service generally does not exceed one year. F-11 Food, Merchandise and Other Revenue Food, merchandise and other revenue primarily consists of culinary, merchandise and other in-park products and also includes other miscellaneous revenue which is not significant in the periods presented, including revenue related to the Company’s international agreements as discussed in Note 4–Revenues. The Company recognizes revenue for food, merchandise and other in-park products when the related products or services are received by the guests. Certain admission products may also include bundled products at the time of purchase, such as culinary or merchandise items. The Company conducts an analysis of bundled products to identify separate distinct performance obligations that are material in the context of the contract. For those products that are determined to be distinct performance obligations and material in the context of the contract, the Company allocates a portion of the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation using each performance obligation’s standalone price. If the bundled product is related to a pass product and offered over time, revenue will be recognized over time accordingly. See further discussion in Note 4–Revenues. Advertising and Promotional Costs Advertising production costs are deferred and expensed the first time the advertisement is shown. Other advertising and media costs are expensed as incurred and for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, totaled approximately $127.5 million, $118.0 million and $124.6 million, respectively, and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Equity-Based Compensation In accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation , the Company measures the cost of employee services rendered in exchange for share-based compensation based upon the grant date fair market value. The cost is recognized over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period unless service or performance conditions require otherwise. The Company recognizes the impact of forfeitures as they occur. The Company grants time-vesting restricted shares and units, time-vesting deferred stock units, performance-vesting restricted shares and units, and stock options. The Company uses the closing stock price on the date of grant to value its time-vesting restricted share awards and its performance-vesting restricted share awards. The Company uses the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model to value stock options at the date of grant. On occasion, the Company may modify the terms or conditions of an equity award for its employees. If an award is modified, the Company evaluates the type of modification in accordance with ASC 718 to determine the appropriate accounting. See further discussion in Note 19–Equity-Based Compensation. Restructuring Costs The Company accounts for exit or disposal of activities in accordance with ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations if the one-time benefit arrangements are not part of an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract. Nonretirement postemployment benefits that are part of an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract are accounted for in accordance with ASC 712, Compensation-Nonretirement Postemployment Benefits . The Company defines a business restructuring as an exit or disposal activity that includes but is not limited to a program which is planned and controlled by management and materially changes either the scope of a business or the manner in which that business is conducted. Business restructuring charges may include (i) one-time termination benefits related to employee separations, (ii) contract termination costs and (iii) other related costs associated with exit or disposal activities. If the one-time benefit arrangements are not part of an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract, a liability is recognized and measured at its fair value for one-time termination benefits once the plan of termination is communicated to affected employees and it meets all of the following criteria: (i) management commits to a plan of termination, (ii) the plan identifies the number of employees to be terminated and their job classifications or functions, locations and the expected completion date, (iii) the plan establishes the terms of the benefit arrangement and (iv) it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or the plan will be withdrawn. If the one-time benefit arrangements are part of an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract, a liability is recognized and measured at its fair value for one-time termination benefits when the following conditions are met: (i) the obligation is attributable to services already rendered; (ii) rights to those benefits accumulate; (iii) payment of the benefits is probable; and (iv) amount can be reasonably estimated. If these four conditions are not met, a liability is recognized when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated in accordance with ASC 450-20, Loss Contingencies . Contract termination costs include costs to terminate a contract or costs that will continue to be incurred under the contract without benefit to the Company. A liability is recognized and measured at its fair value when the Company either terminates the contract or ceases using the rights conveyed by the contract. F-12 Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Realization is dependent on generating sufficient future taxable income or the reversal of deferred tax liabilities during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. The Company evaluates its tax positions by determining if it is more likely than not a tax position is sustainable upon examination, based upon the technical merits of the position, before any of the benefit is recorded for financial statement purposes. The benefit is measured as the largest dollar amount of position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon settlement. Previously recorded benefits that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are charged to earnings in the period that the determination is made. Interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits are charged to the provision for (benefit from) income taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). See further discussion in Note 14–Income Taxes. Fair Value Measurements Fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement and is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. An entity is permitted to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each period. The Company has not elected to use the fair value option for any of its financial assets and financial liabilities that are not already recorded at fair value. Carrying values of financial instruments classified as current assets and current liabilities approximate fair value, due to their short-term nature. Fair Value Hierarchy —As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, fair value accounting standards establish a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity. Fair value is determined for assets and liabilities, based upon significant levels of observable or unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s market assumptions. This hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. These two types of inputs have created the following fair value hierarchy: Level 1 —Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Level 2 —Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets. Level 3 —Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. Determination of Fair Value —If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed valuation techniques that use, where possible, current market-based or independently sourced market parameters, such as interest and currency rates. Assets or liabilities valued using such internally generated valuation techniques are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation. Thus, an item may be classified in Level 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that are readily observable. See further discussion in Note 16–Fair Value Measurements. Segment Reporting The Company maintains discrete financial information for each of its twelve theme parks, which is used by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”), identified as the Chief Executive Officer, as a basis for allocating resources. Each theme park has been identified as an operating segment and meets the criteria for aggregation due to similar economic characteristics. In addition, all of the theme parks provide similar products and services and share similar processes for delivering services. The theme parks have a high degree of similarity in the workforces and target similar consumer groups. Accordingly, based on these economic and operational similarities and the way the CODM monitors and makes decisions affecting the operations, the Company has concluded that its operating segments may be aggregated and that it has one reportable segment. F-13 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging , provides the disclosure requirements for derivatives and hedging activities with the intent to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of: (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how the entity accounts for derivative instruments and related hedged items, and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Further, qualitative disclosures are required that explain the Company’s objectives and strategies for using derivatives, as well as quantitative disclosures about the fair value of, and gains and losses on, derivative instruments, and disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative instruments. During 2018, the Company has adopted ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities , which aims to improve reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements and simplify the application of the hedge accounting guidance. See Note 3 – Recent Accounting Pronouncements for further details. As required by ASC 815, the Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value as either assets or liabilities. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. For derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk, the changes in fair value of the derivative contract are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, and subsequently reclassified into interest expense in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge. The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of its risk, even though hedge accounting does not apply or the Company elects not to apply hedge accounting. See further discussion in Note 13–Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. 3. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS The Company reviews new accounting pronouncements as they are issued or proposed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). Recently Implemented Accounting Standards In February 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2018-02, Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. This ASU gives companies the option to reclassify to retained earnings any tax effects related to items in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss that are stranded due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). Companies are able to early adopt this ASU in any interim or annual period for which financial statements have not yet been issued and apply it either (1) in the period of adoption or (2) retrospectively to each period in which the income tax effects of the Tax Act related to items in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss are recognized. When adopted, the ASU requires all entities to make new disclosures, regardless of whether they elect to reclassify stranded amounts. Companies are required to disclose whether or not they elected to reclassify the tax effects related to the Tax Act as well as their policy for releasing income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual reporting periods with early adoption permitted. On January 1, 2018, the Company elected to early adopt the ASU and applied the amendments in the period of adoption. As a result, the Company reclassified $1.1 million of “stranded” tax effects of the Tax Act from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to accumulated deficit in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the accompanying consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ equity. See Note 13 – Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities for additional disclosure. In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities . ASU 2017-12 aims to improve reporting of hedging relationships to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements and simplify the application of the hedge accounting guidance. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those annual reporting periods with early adoption permitted. For cash flow and net investment hedges existing as of the adoption date, the guidance requires a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the beginning of the fiscal year that an entity adopts the amendments; however, the presentation and disclosure guidance should be applied prospectively. The Company adopted ASU 2017-12 during the second quarter of 2018. The impact of the adoption was not material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements; as a result, no cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings was required. See Note 13 – Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities for additional disclosure. F-14 In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, Compensation–Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting. This ASU was issued to provide clarity and reduce diversity in practice regarding the application of guidance on the modification of equity awards. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual reporting periods with early adoption permitted and should b e applied prospectively to an award modified on or after the adoption date. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2018. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements as the Company hist orically has accounted for all modifications in accordance with Topic 718 and has not been subject to the exception described under this ASU. In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Restricted Cash–a Consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force . This ASU requires companies to include restricted cash balances with cash and cash equivalent balances in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual reporting periods with early adoption permitted, and should be applied using a retrospective transition method. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2018 using the retrospective transition method. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the adoption of ASU 2016-18 increased net cash used in investing activities by $0.4 million and decreased net cash used in investing activities by $0.2 million, respectively, when compared to the previously reported amounts in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory . ASU 2016-16 simplifies the income tax accounting of intra-entity transfers of an asset other than inventory by requiring an entity to recognize the income tax effect when the transfer occurs. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods and early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2018 using a modified retrospective transition method. The adoption of ASU 2016-16 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. This ASU provides guidance on the presentation and classification of eight specific cash flow issues that previously resulted in diversity in practice. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods therein. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2018 using a retrospective transition method for each period presented. The adoption of ASU 2016-15 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition . Under this ASU and subsequently issued amendments, revenue is recognized at the time a good or service is transferred to a customer for the amount of consideration expected to be received. Entities may use a full retrospective approach or report the cumulative effect as of the date of adoption. The Company adopted this standard and subsequently issued amendments on January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective transition method. The adoption of ASU 2014-09 and its subsequently issued amendments did not have a material impact on the Company’s existing or new contracts as of January 1, 2018; therefore, no cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings was required as a result of adoption. See Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies subtopic “ Revenue Recognition ” and Note 4 – Revenues for additional disclosure. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The new standard is intended to provide enhanced transparency and comparability by requiring lessees to record right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities on the balance sheet. The new guidance will require the Company to continue to classify leases as either operating or financing, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. Accounting by lessors will remain largely unchanged from current GAAP. Lessees and lessors are also required to disclose qualitative and quantitative information about leasing arrangements to enable financial statement users to assess the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases , and ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842) Targeted Improvements. ASU 2018-10 clarifies how to apply certain aspects of ASU 2016-02. ASU 2018-11 provides entities the option of recognizing the cumulative effect of applying the new standard as an adjustment to beginning retained earnings in the year of adoption while continuing to present all prior periods under previous lease accounting guidance. These ASUs will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods therein with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted these ASU’s (collectively, “ASC 842”) on January 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective method. The new standard also provides a number of optional provisions, known as practical expedients, which companies may elect to adopt to facilitate implementation. Upon adoption, the Company elected the package of practical expedients which, among other items, precludes the Company from needing to reassess 1) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, 2) the lease classification of any expired or existing leases, and 3) initial direct costs for any existing leases. In preparation for the adoption of ASC 842, the Company is establishing new processes and internal controls and is also implementing a new lease accounting information system to enable the preparation of financial information to comply with the new lease accounting and disclosure requirements. F-15 The Company is finalizing its analysis of the expected impacts that the adoption of ASC 842 will have on its consolidated financial statements. Based on preliminary estimates, the Company expects to record right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities of approximately $130.0 million as of January 1, 2019 based on the present value of future minimum lease payments. The Company is currently analy zing other impacts the adoption of ASC 842 may have, however it does not expect a material impact on its consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss), consolidated statements of cash flows or debt covenant calculations . For more information rega rding the Company’s commitments under long-term operating leases requiring annual minimum lease payments, refer to Note 15 – Commitments and Contingencies. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-09, Codification Improvements, which clarifies, corrects and makes minor improvements to a wide variety of topics in the ASC. The amendments make the ASC easier to understand and apply by eliminating inconsistencies and providing clarifications. The transition and effective dates are based on the facts and circumstances of each amendment, with some amendments becoming effective upon issuance of the ASU, and others becoming effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Included in this ASU are amendments to ASC 718-740 , Compensation - Stock Compensation - Income Taxes, which clarify that an entity should recognize excess tax benefits in the period in which the amount of deduction is determined. The Company is evaluating the effect of the amendments within ASU 2018-09, but does not expect a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018 - 15 , Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That is a Service Contract . This ASU generally aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. Capitalized implementation costs related to a hosting arrangement that is a service contract will be amortized over the term of the hosting arrangement, beginning when the module or component of the hosting arrangement is ready for its intended use. The ASU also adds certain disclosure requirements related to implementation costs incurred for internal-use software and cloud computing arrangements. ASU 2018 - 15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The amendments in this ASU can be applied either retrospectively or prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance, but does not expect adoption will have a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results of operations. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820). The ASU eliminates certain disclosures related to the amount of and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The ASU also adds new disclosure requirements for Level 3 measurements. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted for any eliminated or modified disclosures. The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance, but does not expect adoption will have a material impact on the Company's disclosures. In October 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-16 , Derivatives and Hedging—Inclusion of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Overnight Index Swap (OIS) Rate as a Benchmark Interest Rate for Hedge Accounting Purposes , which expands the list of United States benchmark interest rates permitted in the application of hedge accounting. The amendments in this ASU allow use of the Overnight Index Swap (OIS) rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as a U.S. benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes under Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging . The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of 2019 using a prospective method. The Company does not expect adoption will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 4. REVENUES Effective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , using the modified retrospective transition method. The adoption of ASC 606 did not have a material impact on the Company’s existing or new contracts as of January 1, 2018; therefore, no cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings was required as a result of adoption. The Company recognizes revenue upon admission into a park for single day tickets and when products are received by customers for merchandise, culinary or other in-park spending. For season passes and other multi-use admission products, deferred revenue is recorded and the related revenue is recognized over the terms of the admission product and its estimated redemption rates, which is adjusted periodically. Total revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) are recorded net of sales-related taxes collected from guests and remitted or payable to government taxing authorities. See further discussion in Note 2–Summary of Significant Accounting Policies- Revenue Recognition . Deferred revenue primarily includes revenue associated with pass products and contract liability balances related to licensing and international agreements collected in advance of the Company’s performance and expected to be recognized in future periods. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, $10.1 million and $10.9 million, respectively, is included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets related to the long-term portion of deferred revenue, which primarily relates to the Company’s international agreement, as discussed in the following section. The Company expects to recognize this revenue over the term of the F-16 respective license agreement beginning when substantially all of the s ervices have been performed, which is expected to be upon opening. The following table reflects the Company’s deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2018 and 2017: 2018 2017 (In thousands) Deferred revenue, including long-term portion $ 111,181 $ 90,437 Less: Deferred revenue, long-term portion, included in other liabilities 10,071 10,883 Deferred revenue, short-term portion $ 101,110 $ 79,554 With the exception of an immaterial amount, substantially all of the $79.6 million of deferred revenue, short term portion, balance outstanding as of January 1, 2018 was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018. The change in deferred revenue as of December 31, 2018 compared to the prior period relates to additional pass product sales during the year ended December 31, 2018, offset by revenue recognized during 2018. International Agreements In March 2017, the Company entered into a Park Exclusivity and Concept Design Agreement (the “ECDA”) and a Center Concept and Preliminary Design Support Agreement (the “CDSA”) (collectively, the “ZHG Agreements”) with an affiliate of Zhonghong Zhuoye Group Co., Ltd. (“ZHG Group”), a related party, to provide design, support and advisory services for various potential projects and grant exclusive rights in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau (the “Territory”). The Company analyzed the ZHG Agreements under ASC 606 and determined that the agreements should be combined for accounting purposes and the respective performance obligations should be combined into a single performance obligation which meets the criteria to be recognized over time. Additionally, the services related to the ZHG Agreements are provided ratably over the contract term, as such, the Company recognizes revenue under the ZHG Agreements on a straight line basis over the contractual term of the agreements including approximately $5.1 million and $3.9 million in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, which is included in food, merchandise and other revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). See further discussion in Note 17–Related Party Transactions. The Company has also received $10.0 million in deferred revenue recorded in other liabilities related to a nonrefundable payment received from a partner in connection with a potential project in the Middle East (the “Middle East Project”) to provide certain services pertaining to the planning and design of the Middle East Project, with funding received expected to offset internal expenses. Approximately $3.8 million and $3.1 million of costs incurred related to the Middle East Project are recorded in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company has recognized an asset for the costs incurred to fulfill the contract as the costs are specifically identifiable, enhance resources that will be used to satisfy performance obligations in the future and are expected to be recovered. The related deferred revenue and expense will begin to be recognized when substantially all of the services have been performed, which is expected to be upon opening of the park. The Company continually monitors performance on the contract and will make adjustments, if necessary. The Middle East Project is subject to various conditions, including, but not limited to, the parties completing the design development and there is no assurance that the Middle East Project will be completed or advance to the next stages. 5. EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE Earnings (loss) per share is computed as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Net Income Shares Per Share Amount Net Loss Shares Per Share Amount Net Loss Shares Per Share Amount (In thousands, except per share amounts) Basic earnings (loss) per share $ 44,788 86,170 $ 0.52 $ (202,386 ) 85,811 $ (2.36 ) $ (12,531 ) 84,925 $ (0.15 ) Effect of dilutive incentive-based awards 740 — — Diluted earnings (loss) per share $ 44,788 86,910 $ 0.52 $ (202,386 ) 85,811 $ (2.36 ) $ (12,531 ) 84,925 $ (0.15 ) In accordance with the Earnings Per Share Topic of the ASC, basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period (excluding treasury stock and unvested restricted stock). The shares of unvested restricted stock are eligible to receive dividends; however, dividend rights will be forfeited if the award does not vest. Accordingly, only vested shares of outstanding restricted stock are included in the calculation of basic earnings per share. The weighted average number of repurchased shares during the period, if any, which are held as treasury stock, are excluded from shares of common stock outstanding. F-17 Diluted earnings (loss) per share is determined using the treasury stock method based on the dilutive effect of unvested restricted awards and c ertain shares of common stock that are issuable upon exercise of stock options. During the year ended December 31, 2018, there were approximately 1,299,000 anti-dilutive shares of common stock excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share. Du ring the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, there were approximately 5,090,000 and 4,807,000 potentially dilutive shares of common stock excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share as their effect would have been anti-dilutive due to the C ompany’s net loss in those periods, respectively. The Company’s outstanding performance-vesting restricted share awards are considered contingently issuable shares and are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share until the performance measure criteria is met as of the end of the reporting period. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, approximately 364,000, 78,000, and 13,000 performance-vesting restricted share awards had met their performance criteria as of the end of the reporting periods, respectively, and are therefore included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share.

During 2016, the Company recorded approximately $6.4 million in asset write-offs associated with a canceled project, whic h is included in operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2016. 9. GOODWILL, NET 2017 Interim Impairment Test — Due to financial performance particularly late in the second quarter of 2017 at the Company’s SeaWorld Orlando park, the Company determined a triggering event occurred that required an interim goodwill impairment test for its SeaWorld Orlando reporting unit as of June 30, 2017. Based on financial performance and the resulting impact on projections at that time of future cash flows for this reporting unit, the Company concluded that the reporting unit’s goodwill was fully impaired and recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $269.3 million in the accompanying consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss) during the year ended December 31, 2017. The estimated fair value for the SeaWorld Orlando reporting unit was determined using the income approach and represents a Level 3 fair value measurement measured on a non-recurring basis in the fair value hierarchy due to the Company’s use of internal projections and unobservable measurement inputs. The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for each reporting unit for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 are as follows: SeaWorld Orlando Discovery Cove Total (In thousands) Gross carrying amount at January 1, 2017 $ 269,332 $ 66,278 $ 335,610 Accumulated impairment loss at January 1, 2017 — — — Net carrying amount at January 1, 2017 269,332 66,278 335,610 Goodwill impairment charge (269,332 ) — (269,332 ) Net carrying amount at December 31, 2017 — 66,278 66,278 Changes in goodwill — — — Net carrying amount at December 31, 2018 $ — $ 66,278 $ 66,278 Annual Impairment Test —The Company performed a qualitative assessment on its remaining goodwill at December 1, 2018 and 2017, which now relates only to its Discovery Cove reporting unit, and concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that goodwill was not impaired. 10. TRADE NAMES/TRADEMARKS AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET 2017 Interim Impairment Test – Due to financial performance particularly late in the second quarter of 2017 at the Company’s SeaWorld San Diego and Orlando parks, the Company determined a triggering event occurred that required an interim impairment test for certain trade names/trademarks with a combined balance of $93.0 million related to the SeaWorld brand. Based on its assessment, the Company calculated that the estimated fair value of the trade names/trademarks exceeded their carrying values. As a result, the Company determined there was no impairment as the estimated fair values of these trade names/trademarks were in excess of their carrying values. Annual Impairment Test – The Company conducted a qualitative assessment for its other indefinite-lived intangible assets at December 1, 2018 and concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that the trade names/trademarks were not impaired. The Company also conducted either a qualitative or a quantitative assessment for its other indefinite-lived intangible assets at December 1, 2017 and 2016, and concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that the trade names/trademarks were not impaired.

Additionally, pursuant to the Amended Credit Agreement, SEA terminated the then existing revolving credit commitments and replaced them with a new tranche of revolving credit commitments with an aggregate commitment amount of $210.0 million (the “New Revolving Credit Facility”). F-21 In conn ection with the issuance of the additional Term B-5 Loans and as a result of the Amended Credit Agreement, SEA recorded a discount of $0.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. Additionally, SEA wrote-off debt issuance costs of $8.2 million, whi ch is included in loss on early extinguishment of debt and write-off of discounts and debt issuances costs in the accompanying consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss) during the year ended December 31, 2018.

See discussion in the Senior Secured Credit F acilities section which follows for further information. As of December 31, 2018, SEA was in compliance with all covenants contained in the documents governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Senior Secured Credit Facilities As of December 31, 2018, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities consisted of $1.523 billion in Term B-5 Loans which will mature on March 31, 2024 and a $210.0 million New Revolving Credit Facility, of which $30.0 million was outstanding as of December 31, 2018. The New Revolving Credit Facility will mature on October 31, 2023. The outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility was included in current maturities of long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 due to the Company’s intent to repay the borrowings within the following twelve month period. Subsequent to December 31, 2018, SEA borrowed an additional $45.0 million on the New Revolving Credit Facility for general working capital purposes. The Term B-5 Loans amortize in equal quarterly installments, commencing with the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2018, in aggregate annual amounts equal to 1.015% of the original principal amount of Term B-5 Loans outstanding on the Effective Date, with the balance payable on the final maturity date. SEA may voluntarily repay amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities at any time without premium or penalty, other than customary “breakage” costs with respect to LIBOR loans. SEA is required to prepay the outstanding Term B-5 Loans, subject to certain exceptions, with (i) 50% of SEA’s annual “excess cash flow” (with step-downs to 25% and 0%, as applicable, based upon achievement by SEA of a certain secured total leverage ratio), subject to certain exceptions; (ii) 100% of the net cash proceeds of certain non-ordinary course asset sales or other dispositions subject to reinvestment rights and certain exceptions; and (iii) 100% of the net cash proceeds of any incurrence of debt by SEA or any of its restricted subsidiaries, other than debt permitted to be incurred or issued under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, each lender of term loans has the right to reject its pro rata share of mandatory prepayments described above, in which case SEA may retain the amounts so rejected. The foregoing mandatory prepayments will be applied pro rata to installments of term loans in direct order of maturity. During the first quarter of 2017, the Company made a mandatory prepayment of approximately $6.3 million based on its excess cash flow calculation as of December 31, 2016. Approximately $3.5 million of the mandatory prepayment was accepted by the lenders and applied ratably to the Term B-2 and Term B-3 Loans prior to Amendment No. 8 on March 31, 2017, and the remainder of $2.8 million was applied as a voluntary prepayment to the Term B-2 Loans in the second quarter of 2017. There were no mandatory prepayments made during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2016. SEA may go to market to increase and/or add one or more incremental term loan facilities to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and/or increase commitments under the New Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $350.0 million. SEA may also incur additional incremental term loans provided that, among other things, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the incurrence of such incremental term loans, the First Lien Secured Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, is no greater than 3.50 to 1.00. The obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities are fully, unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by the Company, any subsidiary of the Company that directly or indirectly owns 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of SEA, and, subject to certain exceptions, each of SEA’s existing and future material domestic wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities are collateralized by first priority or equivalent security interests, subject to certain exceptions, in (i) all the capital stock of, or other equity interests in, substantially all of SEA’s direct or indirect material domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the capital stock of, or other equity interests in, any “first tier” foreign subsidiaries and (ii) certain tangible and intangible assets of SEA and the Company. Certain financial, affirmative and negative covenants are included in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. If an event of default occurs, the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities will be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor. F-22 Term B-5 Loans The Term B-5 Loans were initially borrowed in an aggregate principal amount of $998.3 million on March 31, 2017 in connection with Amendment No. 8. Additional Term B-5 Loans of $543.9 million were borrowed on October 31, 2018 in connection with the Amended Credit Agreement. Borrowings of the Term B-5 Loans under the Amended Credit Agreement bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to, at SEA ’ s option, (i) a base rate equal to the higher of (a) the federal funds rate plus 1/2 of 1% and (b) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as its “ prime rate ” (provided that in no event shall such base rate with respect to the Term B-5 Loans be less than 1.75% per annum), in each case, plus an applicable margin of 2.00% or (ii) a LIBOR rate based on the British Bankers Association LIBOR Rate (or any successor thereto) for the applicable interest period (provided that in no event shall such LIBOR rate with respect to the Term B-5 Loans be less than 0.75% per annum) plus an applicable margin of 3.00%. New Revolving Credit Facility Borrowings of the New Revolving Credit Facility under the Amended Credit Agreement bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to, at SEA ’ s option, (i) a base rate equal to the higher of (a) the federal funds rate plus 1 ⁄ 2 of 1% and (b) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as its “ prime rate ” , in each case, plus an applicable margin equal to 1.75%; or (ii) a LIBOR rate based on the British Bankers Association LIBOR Rate (or any successor thereto) for the applicable interest period (provided that in no event shall such LIBOR rate with respect to the New Revolving Credit Facility be less than 0.0% per annum) plus an applicable margin equal to 2.75%. The applicable margin for borrowings under the New Revolving Credit Facility are subject to one 25 basis point step-down upon achievement by SEA of certain corporate credit ratings, which the Company did not achieve as of December 31, 2018. In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, SEA is required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders under the New Revolving Credit Facility in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder at a rate of 0.50% per annum. SEA is also required to pay customary letter of credit fees. As of December 31, 2018, SEA had approximately $21.3 million of outstanding letters of credit leaving approximately $158.7 million available for borrowing under the New Revolving Credit Facility. Restrictive Covenants The Senior Secured Credit Facilities contain a number of customary negative covenants. Such covenants, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of SEA and its restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness; make guarantees; create liens on assets; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; engage in mergers or consolidations; sell assets; make fundamental changes; pay dividends and distributions or repurchase SEA’s capital stock; make investments, loans and advances, including acquisitions; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; make changes in the nature of the business; and make prepayments of junior debt. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities also contain covenants requiring SEA to limit annual capital expenditures and maintain a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. All of the net assets of SEA and its consolidated subsidiaries are restricted and there are no unconsolidated subsidiaries of SEA. The Amended Credit Agreement removed all financial covenants on the Term B-5 Loans. The New Revolving Credit Facility requires that the Company comply with a springing maximum first lien secured leverage ratio of 6.25x to be tested as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, solely to the extent that on such date the aggregate amount of funded loans and letters of credit (excluding undrawn letters of credit in an amount not to exceed $30.0 million and cash collateralized letters of credit) under the New Revolving Credit Facility exceeds an amount equal to 35% of the then outstanding commitments under the New Revolving Credit Facility. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities permit restricted payments in an aggregate amount per annum equal to the sum of (A) $25.0 million plus (B) an amount, if any, equal to (1) if the total leverage ratio on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the payment of any such restricted payment, is no greater than 3.50 to 1.00, an unlimited amount, (2) if the total leverage ratio on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the payment of any such restricted payment is no greater than 4.00 to 1.00 and greater than 3.50 to 1.00, the greater of (a) $95.0 million and (b) 7.50% of Market Capitalization (as defined in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities), (3) if the total leverage ratio on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the payment of any such restricted payment is no greater than 4.50 to 1.00 and greater than 4.00 to 1.00, $95.0 million and (4) if the total leverage ratio on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the payment of any such restricted payment is no greater than 5.00 to 1.00 and greater than 4.50 to 1.00, $65.0 million. As of December 31, 2018, the total leverage ratio as calculated under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 3.58 to 1.00, which would result in the Company having approximately $180.0 million available capacity for restricted payments. However, the available capacity for restricted payments is recalculated at the beginning of each quarter, or upon declaration of a restricted payment, as set forth in the credit agreement. F-23 Long-term debt at December 31, 2018 , is repayable as follows and does not include the impact of any future voluntary prepayments. The outstanding balance under the New Revolving Credit Facility is included in current maturities of long-term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance she et as of December 31, 2018, due to the Company’s intent to repay the borrowings within the next twelve months: Years Ending December 31, (In thousands) 2019 $ 45,505 2020 15,505 2021 15,505 2022 15,505 2023 15,505 Thereafter 1,445,864 Total $ 1,553,389 Interest Rate Swap Agreements As of December 31, 2018, the Company has five interest rate swap agreements (“the Interest Rate Swap Agreements”) which effectively fix the interest rate on the LIBOR-indexed interest payments associated with $1.0 billion of SEA’s outstanding long-term debt. The Interest Rate Swap Agreements became effective on September 30, 2016; have a total notional amount of $1.0 billion; mature on May 14, 2020; require the Company to pay a weighted-average fixed rate of 2.45% per annum to swap counterparties; provide that the Company receives a variable rate of interest based upon the greater of 0.75% or the BBA LIBOR; and have interest settlement dates occurring on the last day of December, March, June and September through maturity. In 2016, the Company had four interest rate swap agreements (the “Former Interest Rate Swap Agreements”) which matured in accordance with their terms. Three of the interest rate swap agreements had a combined notional amount of $1.0 billion; required the Company to pay a fixed rate of interest between 1.049% and 1.051% per annum; paid swap counterparties a variable rate of interest based upon the greater of 0.75% or the three month BBA LIBOR; and had interest settlement dates occurring on the last day of March, June, September and December through maturity. The fourth interest rate swap was executed in April 2015 to effectively fix the interest rate on $250.0 million of the Term B-3 Loans and had a notional amount of $250.0 million; required the Company to pay a fixed rate of interest of 0.901% per annum; paid swap counterparties a variable rate of interest based upon the greater of 0.75% or the three month BBA LIBOR; and had interest settlement dates occurring on the last day of December, March, June and September through maturity. SEA designated the Interest Rate Swap Agreements and the Former Interest Rate Swap Agreements above as qualifying cash flow hedge accounting relationships as further discussed in Note 13–Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities which follows. Cash paid for interest relating to the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, Interest Rate Swap Agreements and Former Interest Rate Swap Agreements, net of amounts capitalized, as applicable, was $82.5 million, $80.6 million and $46.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Cash paid for interest during the year ended December 31, 2017 excludes $5.1 million related to the fourth quarter interest payment on the Term B-2 Loans which was paid on January 5, 2018. Cash paid for interest during the year ended December 31, 2016 excludes $12.9 million related to the fourth quarter interest payment on the Senior Secured Credit Facilities which was paid on January 3, 2017. See Note 11–Other Accrued Liabilities for accrued interest included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. 13. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES Risk Management Objective of Using Derivatives The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources and duration of its debt funding and the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. The Company’s derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing and duration of the Company’s known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments principally related to the Company’s borrowings. The Company does not speculate using derivative instruments. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company did not have any derivatives outstanding that were not designated in hedge accounting relationships. F-24 Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk The Company’s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing variable-rate debt. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had five Interest Rate Swap Agreements that mature on May 14, 2020, which effectively fix the interest rate on LIBOR-indexed interest payments associated with $1.0 billion of SEA’s outstanding long-term debt. The interest rate swap agreements are designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk. The changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the Company’s variable-rate debt. During the next 12 months, the Company estimates that an additional $2.5 million will be reclassified as a reduction to interest expense. Tabular Disclosure of Fair Values of Derivative Instruments on the Balance Sheet The table below presents the fair value of the Company’s derivative financial instruments as well as their classification in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017: Asset Derivatives Liability Derivatives As of December 31, 2018 As of December 31, 2017 Balance Sheet Location Fair Value Balance Sheet Location Fair Value Derivatives designated as hedging instruments: (In thousands) Interest rate swap agreements Other assets 3,109 Other liabilities 8,455 Total derivatives designated as hedging instruments $ 3,109 $ 8,455 Derivative instruments are valued according to the methodology outlined in Note 2–Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. The Company has determined that its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as discussed in Note–16 Fair Value Measurements. The unrealized gain on derivatives is recorded net of a tax expense of $3.1 million and $5.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and is included in the accompanying statements of changes in stockholders’ equity and the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Tabular Disclosure of the Effect of Derivative Instruments on the Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) The table below presents the pre-tax effect of the Company’s derivative financial instruments in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017: 2018 2017 (In thousands) Derivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships: Gain related to effective portion of derivatives recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) $ 14,262 $ 1,619 (Loss) gain related to effective portion of derivatives reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to interest expense $ (2,697 ) $ 12,733 Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features The Company has agreements with each of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where if the Company defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations. F-25 Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) The following table reflects the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, net of tax: Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (In thousands): Gains (Losses) on Cash Flow Hedges Accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31, 2016 $ (13,694 ) Other comprehensive income before reclassifications 972 Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to interest expense 7,646 Unrealized gain on derivatives, net of tax 8,618 Accumulated other comprehensive loss at December 31, 2017 (5,076 ) Effects of adoption of ASU 2018-02 (1,094 ) Other comprehensive income before reclassifications 10,426 Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to interest expense (1,972 ) Unrealized gain on derivatives, net of tax 8,454 Accumulated other comprehensive income at December 31, 2018 $ 2,284 14. INCOME TAXES For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the provision for (benefit from) income taxes is comprised of the following: 2018 2017 2016 Current income tax provision (benefit) (In thousands) Federal $ (99 ) $ (66 ) $ (72 ) State 1,113 1,525 442 Foreign 7 12 23 Total current income tax provision 1,021 1,471 393 Deferred income tax provision (benefit): Federal 13,019 (74,312 ) 5,169 State 3,875 (12,165 ) 3,768 Total deferred income tax provision (benefit) 16,894 (86,477 ) 8,937 Total income tax provision (benefit) $ 17,915 $ (85,006 ) $ 9,330 The deferred income tax provision (benefit) represents the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Cash paid for income taxes totaled $0.8 million, $0.5 million and $0.8 million, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. F-26 The components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 are as follows: 2018 2017 Deferred income tax assets: (In thousands) Acquisition and debt related costs $ 5,814 $ 5,557 Net operating losses 180,658 201,604 Goodwill impairment 53,972 54,207 Self-insurance 6,847 6,992 Deferred revenue 2,718 2,627 Cash flow hedge — 2,282 Restricted stock 4,472 4,097 Tax credits 9,317 7,922 Other 7,779 7,263 Total deferred income tax assets 271,577 292,551 Valuation allowance (2,762 ) (2,762 ) Net deferred tax assets 268,815 289,789 Deferred income tax liabilities: Property and equipment (192,224 ) (201,019 ) Amortization - Goodwill (41,803 ) (37,291 ) Amortization - Other Intangibles (18,144 ) (15,193 ) Cash flow hedge (836 ) — Other (2,992 ) (3,466 ) Total deferred income tax liabilities (255,999 ) (256,969 ) Net deferred income tax assets $ 12,816 $ 32,820 The Company files federal, state and provincial income tax returns in various jurisdictions with varying statute of limitation expiration dates. Under the tax statute of limitations applicable to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations by the Internal Revenue Service for years before 2013. However, because the Company is carrying forward income tax attributes, such as net operating losses and tax credits from 2009 and subsequent years, these attributes can still be audited when utilized on returns filed in the future. The Company has determined that there are no positions currently taken that would rise to a level requiring an amount to be recorded or disclosed as an unrecognized tax benefit. If such positions do arise, it is the Company’s intent that any interest or penalty amount related to such positions will be recorded as a component of the income tax provision in the applicable period. The Company has federal tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $615.3 million as of December 31, 2018 and state net operating loss carryforwards spread across various jurisdictions with a combined total of approximately $990.5 million as of December 31, 2018. These net operating loss carryforwards, if not used to reduce taxable income in future periods, will begin to expire in 2029, for both federal and state tax purposes. Realization of the deferred income tax assets, primarily arising from these net operating loss carryforwards and charitable contribution carryforwards, is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the carryforwards, which may include the reversal of deferred tax liability components. Due to the uncertainty of realizing the benefit from the deferred tax asset recorded for state net operating loss carryforwards, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance of approximately $2.8 million, net of federal tax benefit, on the deferred tax assets related to those state net operating losses as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately $0.4 million of charitable contributions which expired unused. During 2017, an ownership shift of more than 50 percent as defined by the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) Section 382 occurred. The Company determined that, while an ownership shift occurred and limits were determined under Section 382 and the regulations and guidance thereunder, the applicable limits would not impair the value or anticipated use of the Company’s federal and state net operating losses. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that any limitation under IRC Section 382 will not impair the realizability of the deferred income tax assets related to federal and state tax net operating loss carryforwards. However, the annual limitations may impact the timeframe over which the net operating loss carryforwards can be used, potentially impacting the cash tax liabilities in a future period. F-27 The reconciliation between the statutory income tax rate and the Company’s effective income tax provision (benefit) rate for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, is as follows: 2018 2017 2016 Amount % Amount % Amount % (In thousands) Income tax at federal statutory rates $ 13,167 21.00 % $ (100,587 ) 35.00 % $ (1,120 ) 35.00 % Federal net operating loss adjustment — — — — 422 (13.18 ) State taxes, net of federal benefit 4,640 7.40 (5,800 ) 2.02 1,870 (58.42 ) Nondeductible equity-based compensation 668 1.07 2,901 (1.01 ) 8,806 (275.10 ) Tax credits (1,221 ) (1.95 ) (730 ) 0.25 (1,881 ) 58.75 Goodwill impairment — — 17,584 (6.12 ) — — Remeasurement of deferred income tax liabilities resulting from Tax Cuts and Jobs Act — — (1,808 ) 0.63 — — Nondeductible settlement 840 1.34 — — — — Valuation allowance — — 1,688 (0.59 ) (882 ) 27.55 Other (179 ) (0.29 ) 1,746 (0.60 ) 2,115 (66.07 ) Income tax provision (benefit) $ 17,915 28.57 % $ (85,006 ) 29.58 % $ 9,330 (291.47 ) % On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act makes significant modifications to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, including but not limited to a corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective as of January 1, 2018. The Company’s net deferred tax assets and liabilities were revalued at the newly enacted U.S. corporate rate in the year of enactment. 15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES At December 31, 2018, the Company has commitments under long-term operating and capital leases requiring annual minimum lease payments as follows: Years Ending December 31, (In thousands) 2019 $ 16,809 2020 14,405 2021 13,331 2022 11,624 2023 10,683 Thereafter 268,028 Total $ 334,880 Rental expense was $21.2 million, $20.5 million and $20.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The SeaWorld theme park in San Diego, California, leases the land for the theme park from the City of San Diego. The lease term is for 50 years ending on July 1, 2048. Lease payments are based upon gross revenue from the San Diego theme park subject to certain minimums. On January 1, 2017, the minimum annual rent payment was recalculated in accordance with the lease agreement as approximately $10.4 million and is included in the table above for all periods presented. This annual rent will remain in effect until January 1, 2020, at which time the next recalculation will be completed in accordance with the lease agreement. The Company has commenced construction of certain new theme park attractions and other projects under contracts with various third parties, including the construction of a new corporate headquarters building on owned land adjacent to its SeaWorld Orlando park, which is scheduled to be completed in 2019. At December 31, 2018, excluding certain amounts related to the License Agreement with Sesame Workshop as described below, additional capital payments of approximately $207.0 million are necessary to complete these projects. The majority of these projects are expected to be completed in 2019 and 2020. F-28 License Agreements On May 16, 2017, SEA entered into a License Agreement (the “License Agreement”) with Sesame Workshop (“Sesame”), a New York not-for-profit corporation. The License Agreement supersedes the previous two license agreements and extends SEA’s status as Sesame’s exclusive theme park partner in the United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands (the “Sesame Territory”), and provides for the payment of certain royalty payments based on gross receipts for stand-alone theme parks (“Standalone Parks”) and license fees and merchandise royalties for Sesame themed areas within SEA theme parks (“Sesame Lands”). Sesame will retain the right to develop certain family entertainment centers subject to certain restrictions including size, number, types of attractions and geographic location. SEA’s principal commitments pursuant to the License Agreement include: (i) opening a new Sesame Place theme park no later than mid-2021 in a location to be determined within the Sesame Territory; (ii) building a new Sesame Land in SeaWorld Orlando by fall 2022; (iii) investing in minimum annual capital and marketing thresholds; and (iv) providing support for agreed upon sponsorship and charitable initiatives, including Sesame’s annual gala event. As of December 31, 2018, the Company estimates the combined remaining obligations for these commitments could be up to approximately $79.0 million over the remaining term of the agreement. After the opening of the second Standalone Park (counting the existing Sesame Place Standalone Park in Langhorne, Pennsylvania), SEA will have the option to build additional Standalone Parks in the Sesame Territory within agreed upon timelines. The License Agreement has an initial term through December 31, 2031, with an automatic additional 15 year extension plus a five year option added to the term of the License Agreement from December 31st of the year of each new Standalone Park opening. On May 2, 2018 the Company announced that it plans to open Sesame Street at SeaWorld Orlando in Spring of 2019. Pursuant to the License Agreement with Sesame Workshop, the Company pays a specified annual license fee, as well as a specified royalty based on revenues earned in connection with sales of licensed products, all food and beverage items utilizing the licensed elements and any events utilizing such elements if a separate fee is paid for such event. ABI has granted the Company a perpetual, exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use the Busch Gardens trademark and certain related domain names in connection with the operation, marketing, promotion and advertising of certain of the Company’s theme parks, as well as in connection with the production, use, distribution and sale of merchandise sold in connection with such theme parks. Under the license, the Company is required to indemnify ABI against losses related to the use of the marks. Securities Class Action Lawsuits On September 9, 2014, a purported stockholder class action lawsuit consisting of purchasers of the Company’s common stock during the periods between April 18, 2013 and August 13, 2014, captioned Baker v. SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc., et al., Case No. 14-CV-02129-MMA (KSC), was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California against the Company, the Chairman of the Company’s Board, certain of its executive officers and Blackstone. On February 17, 2015, Court-appointed Lead Plaintiffs, Pensionskassen For Børne- Og Ungdomspædagoger and Arkansas Public Employees Retirement System, together with additional plaintiffs, Oklahoma City Employee Retirement System and Pembroke Pines Firefighters and Police Officers Pension Fund (collectively, “Plaintiffs”), then filed an amended complaint against the Company, the Chairman of the Company’s Board, certain of its executive officers, Blackstone, and underwriters of the initial public offering and secondary public offerings. The amended complaint alleges, among other things, that the prospectus and registration statements filed contained materially false and misleading information in violation of the federal securities laws and seeks unspecified compensatory damages and other relief. Plaintiffs contend that defendants knew or were reckless in not knowing that Blackfish was impacting SeaWorld’s business at the time of each public statement. On May 29, 2015, the Company and the other defendants filed motions to dismiss the amended complaint which the Court granted on March 31, 2016. On May 31, 2016, Plaintiffs filed a second amended consolidated class action complaint (“Second Amended Complaint”), which, among other things, no longer names the Company’s Board or underwriters as defendants The Court later denied a renewed motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint. In May 2017, Plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification which the Court granted on November 29, 2017. On December 13, 2017, Defendants filed a petition for permission to appeal the Court’s class certification order with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which was denied on June 28, 2018. Discovery is currently ongoing with the trial scheduled for fall 2019. The Company believes that the class action lawsuit is without merit and intends to defend the lawsuit vigorously; however, there can be no assurance regarding the ultimate outcome of this lawsuit. On June 14, 2018, a lawsuit captioned Highfields Capital I LP et al. v. SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. et al., Civil Action No. 18-cv-1276L-BLM was filed in the United States District Court in the Southern District of California against the Company and certain of the Company’s former and present executive officers (collectively, the “Defendants”). The plaintiffs, which are investment funds managed by a common adviser (collectively, the “Plaintiffs”) allege, among other things, that the Defendants made false and misleading statements in violation of the federal securities laws regarding the impact of the documentary Blackfish on SeaWorld’s business. The complaint further alleges that such statements were made to induce Plaintiffs to purchase common stock of the Company at artificially-inflated prices and that Plaintiffs suffered investment losses as a result. The Plaintiffs are seeking unspecified compensatory damages and other relief. On October 19, 2018, Defendants filed a motion for the partial dismissal of the Plaintiffs’ complaint. On February 7, 2019, the Court granted Defendants’ motion, which leave to amend. The Company believes that the lawsuit is without merit and intends to defend the lawsuit vigorously; however, there can be no assurance regarding the ultimate outcome of this lawsuit. F-29 Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit On December 8, 2014, a putative derivative lawsuit captioned Kistenmacher v. Atchison, et al., Civil Action No. 10437, was filed in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware against, among others, the Chairman of the Company’s Board, certain of the Company’s executive officers, directors and shareholders, and Blackstone. The Company is a “Nominal Defendant” in the lawsuit. On March 30, 2015, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint against the same set of defendants. The amended complaint alleges, among other things, that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties, aided and abetted breaches of fiduciary duties, violated Florida Blue Sky laws and were unjustly enriched by (i) including materially false and misleading information in the prospectus and registration statements; and (ii) causing the Company to repurchase certain shares of its common stock from certain shareholders at an alleged artificially inflated price. The Company does not maintain any direct exposure to loss in connection with this shareholder derivative lawsuit as the lawsuit does not assert any claims against the Company. The Company’s status as a “Nominal Defendant” in the action reflects the fact that the lawsuit is maintained by the named plaintiff on behalf of the Company and that the plaintiff seeks damages on the Company’s behalf. The case is currently stayed in favor of the securities class action captioned Baker v. SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc., et al. described above. Consumer Lawsuit On April 13, 2015, a purported class action was filed in the Superior Court of the State of California for the City and County of San Francisco against SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc., captioned Marc Anderson, et. al., v. SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc. Civil Case No. 15-cv-02172-JSW, (the “Anderson Matter”). The putative class consisted of all consumers within California who, within the past four years, purchased tickets to SeaWorld San Diego. The complaint (as amended) alleges causes of action under the California False Advertising Law, California Unfair Competition Law and California CLRA. Plaintiffs’ claims are based on their allegations that the Company misrepresented the physical living conditions and care and treatment of its orcas, resulting in confusion or misunderstanding among ticket and orca plush purchasers with intent to deceive and mislead the plaintiffs and purported class members. The complaint seeks actual damages, equitable relief, attorneys’ fees and costs. Based on plaintiffs’ definition of the class, the amount in controversy could have exceeded $5.0 million assuming the class became certified. The liability exposure is speculative though. On May 14, 2015, the Company removed the case to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The Company filed a motion for summary judgment on October 30, 2017 which the Court granted in part and denied in part. On May 23, 2018, the plaintiffs represented to the Court that they will not file a motion for class certification. The case is no longer a class action. All three named plaintiffs continue to have claims for individual restitution in a nominal amount and injunctive relief. Trial is currently scheduled for October 2019. The Company believes that the lawsuit is without merit and intends to defend the lawsuit vigorously; however, there can be no assurance regarding the ultimate outcome of these lawsuits. EZPay Plan Class Action Lawsuit On December 3, 2014, a purported class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division against SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc., captioned Jason Herman, Joey Kratt, and Christina Lancaster, as individuals and on behalf of all others similarly situated, v. SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc. Case no: 8:14-cv-03028-MSS-JSS. The certified class action currently consists of two claims for breach of contract, unjust enrichment and violation of federal Electronic Funds Transfer Act, 15 U.S.C. section 1693 et seq. on behalf of three individual plaintiffs as well as on behalf of a two classes: (i) individuals in the states of Florida, Texas, Virginia and California who paid for an annual pass through EZ pay in “less than twelve months,” had their passes automatically renewed and did not use the renewed passes after the first year or were not issued a full refund of payments made after the twelfth payment; and (ii) all of these same individuals who used debit cards. In April 2018, the Company reached a preliminary agreement in principle to settle this matter for a payment of $11.5 million, plus certain administrative costs and expenses associated with the proposed settlement. The proposed settlement is still subject to further documentation and court approval. The Company has accrued $11.5 million and $3.4 million related to this proposed settlement in other accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Other Matters The Company is a party to various other claims and legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business. In addition, from time to time the Company is subject to audits, inspections and investigations by, or receives requests for information from, various federal and state regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”), the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“Cal-OSHA”), the Florida Fish & Wildlife Commission (“FWC”), the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”), the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). F-30 In September 2018, the Company reached a settlement with the SEC relating to a previously disclosed SEC investigation. In connection with the settlement, without admitting or denying the substantive allegations in the SEC’s complaint, the Company agreed to the entry of a final judgment ordering the Company to pay a civil penalty of $4.0 million and enjoining the Company from violation of certain provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and certain rules thereunder. The settlement was approved by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on September 24, 2018. The settlement is recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended De cember 31, 2018 in the Company’s consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). On December 11, 2018, the DOJ informed the Company that it does not intend to take any action against the Company or any individuals in connection with the investigati on previously disclosed by the Company concerning disclosures and public statements made by the Company and certain individuals on or before August 2014 and trading in the Company’s securities. The Company considers the DOJ matter concluded. From time to time, various parties also bring other lawsuits against the Company. Matters where an unfavorable outcome to the Company is probable and which can be reasonably estimated are accrued. Such accruals, which are not material for any period presented, are based on information known about the matters, the Company’s estimate of the outcomes of such matters, and the Company’s experience in contesting, litigating and settling similar matters. Matters that are considered reasonably possible to result in a material loss are not accrued for, but an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss is disclosed, if such amount or range can be determined. At this time, management does not expect any such known claims, legal proceedings or regulatory matters to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. San Diego Hotel Project On January 22, 2018, the Company and Evans Hotel entered into a Limited Liability Company Agreement to develop, own and operate a hotel project (the “San Diego Hotel Project”) to be located on land that the Company leases from the City of San Diego. In September 2018, the Company elected not to proceed with the San Diego Hotel Project and terminated the agreement. As a result, the Company recorded a loss of approximately $2.8 million primarily related to expenses incurred and fees associated with termination of the agreement, which was recorded in operating expenses in the year ended December 31, 2018 in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). 16. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivative financial instruments using the income approach fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company uses readily available market data to value its derivatives, such as interest rate curves and discount factors. ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement also requires consideration of credit risk in the valuation. The Company uses a potential future exposure model to estimate this credit valuation adjustment (“CVA”). The inputs to the CVA are largely based on observable market data, with the exception of certain assumptions regarding credit worthiness which make the CVA a Level 3 input. Based on the magnitude of the CVA, it is not considered a significant input and the derivatives are classified as Level 2. See Note 13-Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Of the Company’s long-term obligations, the Term B-5 Loans are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2018 and the Term B-2 and Term B-5 Loans were classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2017.

The activity related to the Company’s time-vesting and performance-vesting restricted awards during the year ended December 31, 2018 was as follows: Performance-Vesting Restricted Awards Time-Vesting Restricted Awards Bonus Performance Restricted Awards Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Awards 2.75x Performance Restricted shares Shares/Units Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value per Award Shares/Units Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value per Award Shares/Units Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value per Award Shares/Units Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value per Share Outstanding at December 31, 2017 1,852,512 $ 17.09 805,245 $ 18.09 864,572 $ 18.50 616,793 $ 3.56 Granted 354,410 $ 17.52 732,747 $ 14.97 1,171,733 $ 15.04 — $ — Vested (647,415 ) $ 16.47 (69,221 ) $ 18.07 (9,010 ) $ 18.79 — $ — Forfeited (657,803 ) $ 17.60 (908,061 ) $ 17.44 (871,809 ) $ 17.39 (616,793 ) $ 3.56 Outstanding at December 31, 2018 901,704 $ 17.34 560,710 $ 15.06 1,155,486 $ 15.82 — $ — The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately $1.7 million. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was immaterial. The activity related to the Company’s stock option awards during the year ended December 31, 2018 was as follows: Options Weighted Average Exercise Price Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Life (in years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (in thousands) Outstanding at December 31, 2017 2,923,448 $ 18.78 Forfeited (429,992 ) $ 18.00 Expired (1,493,902 ) $ 19.46 Exercised (234,977 ) $ 18.23 Outstanding at December 31, 2018 764,577 $ 18.05 6.82 $ 3,087 Exercisable at December 31, 2018 435,825 $ 18.16 6.72 $ 1,711 Omnibus Incentive Plan The Company has reserved 15,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the Company’s Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Omnibus Incentive Plan”), of which approximately 9,770,000 are available for future issuance as of December 31, 2018. F-33 Bonus Performance Restricted Shares The annual bonus plan for 2018 (the “2018 Bonus Plan”) provides for bonus awards payable 50% in cash and 50% in performance-vesting restricted units (the “Bonus Performance Restricted Units”) and is based upon the Company’s achievement of specified performance goals, as defined by the 2018 Bonus Plan, with respect to the year ended December 31, 2018 (the “Fiscal 2018”). The total number of shares eligible to vest is based on the level of achievement of the targets for Fiscal 2018 which ranges from 0% (if below threshold performance) and up to 150% (at or above maximum performance). Bonus Performance Restricted Units representing the total units that could be earned under the maximum performance level of achievement were granted during the year ended December 31, 2018. In accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation , equity compensation expense is recorded on shares probable of vesting. Based on the Company’s actual Fiscal 2018 results with respect to specific performance goals, a portion of the outstanding Bonus Performance Restricted awards were considered probable of vesting as of December 31, 2018; therefore, equity compensation expense has been recorded related to these awards. These awards are expected to vest in the first quarter of 2019, with the remainder forfeiting in accordance with their terms. The Company also had an annual bonus plan for the year ended December 31, 2017 (the “Fiscal 2017”), under which certain employees were eligible to vest in performance-vesting restricted shares (the “2017 Bonus Performance Restricted Shares”) based upon the Company’s achievement of specified performance goals with respect to Fiscal 2017. Based on the Company’s actual Fiscal 2017 results, approximately 69,000 of these 2017 Bonus Performance Restricted Shares vested in the year ended December 31, 2018 and the remainder forfeited in accordance with their terms. 2018 Long-Term Incentive Awards The long-term incentive plan grants for 2018 (the “2018 Long-Term Incentive Grant”) were comprised of time-vesting restricted units (the “Long-Term Incentive Time Restricted Units”) and performance-vesting restricted units (the “Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Units”) (collectively, the “Long-Term Incentive Awards”). Long-Term Incentive Time Restricted Units Long-Term Incentive Time Restricted Units granted in 2018 largely vest over three years, with one-third vesting on each anniversary of the date of grant, subject to continued employment through the applicable vesting date. Other Long-Term Incentive Time Restricted Units vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant, subject to continued employment through the applicable vesting date. Equity compensation expense for these units is recognized using the straight line method over the three-year vesting period. Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Units The Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Units granted in 2018 are expected to vest following the end of the three-year performance period beginning on January 1, 2018 and ending on December 31, 2020 (the “Fiscal 2020”) based upon the Company’s achievement of specified performance goals for Fiscal 2020, as defined by the 2018 Long-Term Incentive Grant. The total number of Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Units eligible to vest will be based on the level of achievement of the performance goals and ranges from 0% (if below threshold performance) and up to 200% (for at or above maximum performance). Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Units representing the total units that could be earned under the maximum performance level of achievement were granted during the year ended December 31, 2018. The 2018 Long-Term Incentive Grant provides additional incentive for early achievement of the target as follows: if the Company’s Fiscal 2020 target was achieved in 2018, 30% of target Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Units would have been earned and delivered in 2019; if the Company’s Fiscal 2020 target is achieved in 2019, 20% of target Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Units will be earned and delivered in 2020, in each case subject to the overall maximum award of 200% of target. Other Long-Term Incentive Awards The Company also has outstanding time-vesting restricted shares (the “Long-Term Incentive Time Restricted Shares”), performance-vesting restricted shares (the “Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Shares”) and nonqualified stock options (the “Long-Term Incentive Options”) granted under previous long-term incentive plan grants. Long-Term Incentive Time Restricted Shares For certain executives, the Long-Term Incentive Time Restricted Shares vest over five years, with one-third vesting on each of the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the date of grant, subject to continued employment through the applicable vesting date. Equity compensation expense for these shares is recognized using the straight line method with one-third recognized over the initial three year vesting period and the remaining two-thirds recognized over the remaining vesting period. For other employees, the Long-Term Incentive Time Restricted Shares vest over three years, with all of the shares vesting on the third anniversary of the date of grant, subject to continued employment through the applicable vesting date. Equity compensation expense for these shares is recognized using the straight line method over the three year vesting period. Other Long-Term Incentive Time Restricted Shares vest ratably over four years or three years from the date of grant, subject to continued employment through the applicable vesting date. Equity compensation expense is recognized using the straight line method over the respective vesting period. F-34 Long-Term Incentive P erformance Restricted Shares During the year ended December 31, 2018, a portion of the previously granted Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Shares related to completed performance periods vested, with the remainder forfeiting in accordance with their terms. The remaining outstanding Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Shares related to future performance periods are eligible to vest based upon the Company’s achievement of pre-established performance goals for the respective performance period, as defined. Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Shares granted under the 2017 long-term incentive plan (the “2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan’) are expected to vest following the end of the three year performance period beginning on January 1, 2017 and ending on December 31, 2019, based upon the Company’s achievement of pre-established performance goals. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had granted approximately 210,000 Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Shares, net of forfeitures, related to the 2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan which represented the total shares that could be earned under the maximum performance level of achievement. Equity compensation expense is recognized ratably over the three year performance period, if the performance condition is probable of being achieved. Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Shares granted under the 2016 long-term incentive plan (the “2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan”) were expected to vest following the end of a three year performance period ending on December 31, 2018 based upon the Company’s achievement of certain performance goals for each respective fiscal year performance period, established at the beginning of each period. As such, since the performance goal for the 2018 performance period was established in the first quarter of 2018, for accounting purposes, approximately 100,500 of the Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Shares awarded under the 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan, net of forfeitures, have a grant date in 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had outstanding approximately 99,200 Long-Term Incentive Performance Restricted Shares, net of forfeitures, under the 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan, which represents the total shares that could be earned under the maximum performance level of achievement for all three performance periods combined. Based on the Company’s actual results for 2018, a portion of the shares are expected to vest in the first quarter of 2019, with the remainder forfeiting in accordance with their terms. The Company recognizes equity compensation expense for its performance-vesting restricted awards ratably over the related performance period, if the performance condition is probable of being achieved. Based on the Company’s progress towards its respective performance goals, equity compensation expense includes approximately $10.3 million related to all performance-vesting restricted awards in the year ended December 31, 2018. If the probability of vesting related to these awards changes in a subsequent period, all equity compensation expense related to those awards that would have been recorded over the requisite service period had the awards been considered probable at the new percentage from inception, will be recorded as a cumulative catch-up at such subsequent date. Total unrecognized equity compensation expense for all outstanding performance-vesting restricted awards not probable of vesting was approximately $8.6 million as of December 31, 2018. Long-Term Incentive Options Long-Term Incentive Options granted under previous long-term incentive plans vest ratably over four years from the date of grant (25% per year), subject to continued employment through the applicable vesting date and will expire 10 years from the date of grant or earlier if the employee’s service terminates. The Long-Term Incentive Options have an exercise price per share equal to the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. Equity compensation expense is recognized using the straight line method for each tranche over the four year vesting period. Upon stock option exercises, new shares are issued by the Company. Other Deferred Stock Units During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company granted approximately 46,000 deferred stock units (“DSUs”) to certain members of its Board of Directors (the “Board”) which will vest one year from the date of grant. Each DSU represents the right to receive one share of the Company’s common stock one year after the respective director leaves the Board. 2.25x and 2.75x Performance Restricted Shares The Company had awarded under its previous incentive plans certain performance-vesting restricted shares (the “2.25x and 2.75x Performance Restricted shares”). During the first quarter of 2017, the Company modified certain 2.75x Performance Restricted shares to vest 60% upon the closing of the ZHG Transaction on May 8, 2017 (see Note 1–Description of the Business and Note 17–Related-Party Transactions). The remaining outstanding unvested 2.75x Performance Restricted shares continued to be eligible to vest in accordance with their terms if the Seller had received additional proceeds from ZHG sufficient to satisfy a 2.75x cumulative return multiple in the twelve month period following the closing of the ZHG Transaction. The period expired on May 8, 2018; as such, these shares forfeited in the second quarter of 2018. F-35 As the modification discussed above was based on a liquidity event, for accounting purposes, the 2.75x Performance Restricted shares were not considered probable of vesting until such time the ZHG Transaction was consummated. In accordance with the guidance in ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation , as the 2.75x Performance Restricted shares were not considered probable of vesting before or after the date of modification, the Company used the respective modification date fair value to record equity compensation expense related to the modified shares when the liquidity event occurred. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2017, t he Company recognized non-cash equity compensation expense related to all of the 2.75x Performance Restricted shares of approximately $8.4 million and paid cash accumulated dividends of approximately $1.3 million. During the year ended December 31, 2016, based on cash proceeds previously received by certain investment funds affiliated with Blackstone from the Company’s initial public offering and subsequent secondary offerings of stock, the Company’s repurchases of shares and the cumulative dividends paid by the Company, the vesting conditions on the Company’s previously outstanding 2.25x Performance Restricted shares were satisfied. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2016, the 2.25x Performance Restricted shares vested, and the Company recognized non-cash equity compensation expense related to all of the 2.25x Performance Restricted shares of approximately $27.5 million and paid accumulated dividends of approximately $3.4 million. 20. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY As of December 31, 2018, 93,400,929 shares of common stock were issued in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, which includes 10,174,589 shares of treasury stock held by the Company (see Share Repurchase Program discussion below), but excludes 920,904 unvested shares of common stock and 1,696,996 unvested restricted stock units held by certain participants in the Company’s equity compensation plans (see Note 19–Equity-Based Compensation). Share Repurchase Program The Board previously authorized the repurchase of up to $250.0 million of the Company’s common stock (the “Share Repurchase Program”). Under the Share Repurchase Program, the Company is authorized to repurchase shares through open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans and under Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. The Share Repurchase Program has no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued completely at any time. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company repurchased a total of 3,654,816 shares of common stock at a total cost of approximately $98.0 million, leaving approximately $92.0 million available under the Share Repurchase Program as of December 31, 2018. On February 22, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a replenishment to its Share Repurchase Program of $158.0 million, bringing the total amount authorized for future share repurchases to $250.0 million. The number of shares to be purchased and the timing of purchases will be based on the Company’s trading windows and available liquidity, general business and market conditions and other factors, including legal requirements and alternative opportunities. No shares were repurchased by the Company during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. All shares repurchased pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program, along with shares repurchased directly from selling stockholders concurrently with previous secondary offerings, are recorded as treasury stock at a total cost of $252.9 million and $154.9 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and are reflected as a reduction to stockholders’ equity in the accompanying consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ equity. Dividends In 2016, the Board suspended the Company’s then existing quarterly dividend policy to allow greater flexibility to deploy capital to opportunities that offer the greatest long term returns to shareholders, such as, but not limited to, investments in new attractions, debt repayments or share repurchases. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Board declared or paid quarterly cash dividends to all common stockholders of record as follows: Record Date Payment Date Cash Dividend per Common Share January 15, 2016 January 22, 2016 $ 0.21 March 14, 2016 (a) April 1, 2016 $ 0.21 June 20, 2016 (a) July 1, 2016 $ 0.21 September 29, 2016 October 7, 2016 $ 0.10 (a) As the Company had an accumulated deficit at the time these dividends were declared, these dividends were accounted for as a return of capital and recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital in the accompanying consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ equity. F-36 As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had approximately $0.1 million and $0.5 million of cash dividends payable recorded in other accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, which relate to accumulated dividends on unvested time restricted shares and unvested performance r estricted shares with a performance condition considered probable of being achieved. These shares, which were granted prior to the dividend suspension, carry dividend rights and therefore the dividends accumulated and will be paid as the shares vest in acc ordance with the underlying equity compensation grants. These dividend rights will be forfeited if the shares do not vest. Previous dividend declarations on all performance-vesting restricted share awards accumulate and are paid only if the performance co nditions are met and the respective shares vest in accordance with their terms. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, dividends paid in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows primarily relate to shares that carried dividend rights which vested during the respective year. For the year ended December 31, 2016, dividends paid to stockholders were $65.3 million and primarily related to dividend declarations declared prior to the dividend suspension. For tax purposes, all of the 2016 dividends were treated as a return of capital to stockholders. Distributions that qualify as a return of capital are not considered “dividends” for tax purposes only. 21. RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS AND OTHER SEPARATION COSTS Restructuring Programs In August 2018, the Company announced a new restructuring program (the “2018 Restructuring Program”) focused on reducing costs, improving operating margins and streamlining its management structure to create efficiencies and better align with its strategic business objectives. The 2018 Restructuring Program involved the elimination of approximately 125 positions during the third quarter of 2018 across the Company’s theme parks and its corporate headquarters. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded approximately $5.5 million in pre-tax restructuring charges primarily related to severance and other termination benefits, which is included in restructuring and other separation costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). The Company will not incur any additional costs associated with the 2018 Restructuring Program as all continuing service obligations were completed as of December 31, 2018. In October 2017 and December 2016, the Company executed two separate restructuring programs in an effort to reduce costs, increase efficiencies, reduce duplication of functions and improve the Company’s operations (the “2017 Restructuring Program” and the “2016 Restructuring Program”, respectively). The 2017 Restructuring Program involved the elimination of approximately 350 positions by the end of the fourth quarter of 2017 across certain of the Company’s theme parks and corporate headquarters. The 2016 Restructuring Program involved the elimination of approximately 320 positions across all of the Company’s theme parks and corporate headquarters. As a result, during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded approximately $5.2 million and $8.9 million, respectively, in pre-tax restructuring charges primarily related to severance and other termination benefits, which is included in restructuring and other separation costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). The Company will not incur any additional costs associated with the 2017 or the 2016 Restructuring Programs as all continuing service obligations were completed as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Liabilities related to the 2018, 2017 and 2016 Restructuring Programs as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 are included in accrued salaries, wages and benefits in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The 2018, 2017 and 2016 Restructuring Program activity for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was as follows: Severance and Other Employment Expenses 2016 Restructuring Program 2017 Restructuring Program 2018 Restructuring Program Total (In thousands) Liability as of December 31, 2016 $ 7,842 $ — $ — $ 7,842 Costs incurred — 5,200 — 5,200 Reduction in estimated expenses (572 ) — — (572 ) Payments made (7,270 ) (3,966 ) — (11,236 ) Liability as of December 31, 2017 $ — $ 1,234 $ — $ 1,234 Costs incurred — — 5,548 5,548 Payments made — (1,234 ) (5,011 ) (6,245 ) Liability as of December 31, 2018 $ — $ — $ 537 $ 537 The remaining liability as of December 31, 2018 primarily relates to restructuring and other separation costs to be paid as contractually obligated by December 31, 2019 and is included in accrued salaries, wages and benefits in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. F-37 Other Separation Costs Restructuring and other separation costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 also includes severance and other employment expenses for other positions not part of a larger restructuring program and includes certain executives who stepped down from their respective positions during 2018. In particular, on February 27, 2018, the Company announced that its President and Chief Executive Officer (the “Former CEO”) had stepped down from his position and resigned as a member of the Board. In connection with his departure, the Former CEO received a lump sum cash payment of approximately $6.7 million in severance-related benefits, in accordance with his employment agreement. Certain other executives who separated from the Company during the first half of 2018 also received severance-related benefits of approximately $3.8 million in accordance with the terms of their respective employment agreements or relevant company plan, as applicable. These severance expenses are included in restructuring and other separation costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2018. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2018, certain equity awards were accelerated to vest in connection with the departure of specific executives as required by their respective employment agreements.

F-42 SEAWORLD ENTERTAINMENT, INC. NOTES TO CONDENSED PARENT COMPANY ONLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. DESCRIPTION OF SEAWORLD ENTERTAINMENT, INC. SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. (the “Parent”) was incorporated in Delaware on October 2, 2009. At that time, the Parent was owned by ten limited partnerships, ultimately owned by affiliates of The Blackstone Group L.P. (“Blackstone”) and certain co-investors. On May 8, 2017 an affiliate of Zhonghong Zhuoye Group Co., Ltd. (“ZHG Group”), Sun Wise (UK) Co., LTD (“ZHG”) acquired approximately 21% of the then outstanding shares of common stock of the Parent (the “ZHG Transaction”) from Blackstone. Subsequent to the ZHG Transaction, Blackstone did not own any remaining shares of the Company. The Parent has no operations or significant assets or liabilities other than its investment in SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment, Inc. (“SEA”), which owns and operates twelve theme parks within the United States. Accordingly, the Parent is dependent upon distributions from SEA to fund its obligations. However, under the terms of SEA’s various debt agreements, SEA’s ability to pay dividends or lend to the Parent is restricted, except that SEA may pay specified amounts to the Parent to fund the payment of the Parent’s tax obligations. 2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION The accompanying condensed financial statements (the “parent company only financial statements”) include the accounts of the Parent and its investment in SEA accounted for in accordance with the equity method and do not present the financial statements of the Parent and its subsidiary on a consolidated basis. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted since this information is included with the SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “consolidated financial statements”). These parent company only financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements. 3. GUARANTEES SEA is the borrower under the senior secured credit facilities, (the “Senior Secured Credit Facilities”) under a credit agreement (the “Existing Credit Agreement”) dated as of December 1, 2009, as the same may be amended, restated, supplemented or modified from time to time. On March 31, 2017, SEA entered into a refinancing amendment, Amendment No. 8 (the “Amendment No. 8”) to its existing credit agreement and borrowed additional term loans of which the proceeds, along with cash on hand, were used to redeem all of the Term B-3 loans and a portion of the outstanding principal of the Term B-2 loans. Additionally, on October 31, 2018, SEA entered into another refinancing amendment, Amendment No. 9 (the “Amended Credit Agreement”), to its Existing Credit Agreement. In connection with the Amended Credit Agreement, SEA borrowed additional term loans (the “Additional Term B-5 Loans”) of which the proceeds, along with cash on hand, were used to redeem all of the then outstanding principal of the Term B-2 Loans. Additionally, pursuant to the Amended Credit Agreement, SEA terminated the existing revolving credit commitments and replaced them with a new tranche of revolving credit commitments (the “New Revolving Credit Facility”). See further discussion in Note 12–Long-Term Debt of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Under the terms of the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the obligations of SEA are fully, unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by Parent, any subsidiary of Parent that directly or indirectly owns 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interest of SEA, and subject to certain exceptions, each of SEA’s existing and future material domestic wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, the “Guarantors”). F-43 4. DIVIDENDS FROM SUBSIDIARY In 2016, SEA’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) had a policy to pay, subject to legally available funds, regular quarterly cash dividends to the Parent (defined as a restricted payment in the Senior Secured Credit Facilities) and the Parent’s Board had a policy to pay regular quarterly cash dividends to its stockholders. Subsequent to the September 19, 2016 dividend declaration, both SEA’s Board and the Parent’s Board suspended the quarterly dividend policy to allow greater flexibility to deploy capital, when possible, to opportunities that offer the greatest long term returns to shareholders, such as, but not limited to, investments in new attractions, debt repayments or share repurchases. SEA paid a cash dividend to the Parent during the year ended December 31, 2016 related to dividend declarations as follows: Payment Date Cash Dividends Paid (In Thousands) January 22, 2016 $ 17,808 April 1, 2016 (a) $ 21,269 July 1, 2016 (a) $ 18,176 October 7, 2016 $ 8,647 (a) As SEA had an accumulated deficit at the time these dividends were declared to the Parent, these dividends were accounted for as a return of capital by the Parent. The remaining dividends from SEA have been reflected as a return on capital in the accompanying parent company only financial statements. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Parent’s Board declared or paid quarterly cash dividends to all common stockholders of record as follows: Record Date Payment Date Cash Dividend Per Common Share January 15, 2016 January 22, 2016 $ 0.21 March 14, 2016 April 1, 2016 $ 0.21 June 20, 2016 July 1, 2016 $ 0.21 September 29, 2016 October 7, 2016 $ 0.10 As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Parent had $0.1 million and $0.5 million of cash dividends payable included in dividends payable in the accompanying condensed balance sheet, which relates to accumulated dividend on unvested restricted shares in SEA’s equity compensation plan. These shares, which were granted prior to the dividend suspension, carry dividend rights and therefore dividends accumulate and will be paid as the shares vest in accordance with the underlying equity compensation grants. These dividend rights will be forfeited if the shares do not vest. See Note 20–Stockholders’ Equity of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion. During the year ended December 31, 2018, SEA paid dividends to the Parent of approximately $98.0 million. The dividends were in the form of payments that SEA made for share repurchases at the Parent level (see Note 5–Stockholders’ Equity which follows). During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, Parent paid accumulated dividends, net of forfeitures, related to shares that carried dividend rights which vested during the respective year. For the year ended December 31, 2016, dividends paid to stockholders were $65.3 million and primarily related to dividend declarations declared prior to the dividend suspension. 5. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY Omnibus Incentive Plan The Parent has reserved 15,000,000 shares of common stock for future issuance under the Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Omnibus Incentive Plan”), of which approximately 9,770,000 are available for future issuance as of December 31, 2018. The Omnibus Incentive Plan is administered by the compensation committee of the Parent’s Board, and provides that the Parent may grant equity incentive awards to eligible employees, directors, consultants or advisors of the Parent or its subsidiary, SEA, in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other stock-based and performance compensation awards. If an award under the Omnibus Incentive Plan expires or is canceled, forfeited, or terminated, without issuance to the participant, the unissued shares may be granted again under the Omnibus Incentive Plan. See further discussion in Note 19–Equity-Based Compensation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. During the year ended December 31, 2018, Parent transferred approximately $4.2 million in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options to SEA as a capital contribution and increased its investment in SEA. F-44 Share Repurchase Program The Parent’s Board previously authorized the repurchase of up to $250.0 million of the Company’s common stock (the “Share Repurchase Program”). Under the Share Repurchase Program, the Parent is authorized to repurchase shares through open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans and under Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. The Share Repurchase Program has no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued completely at any time. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Parent repurchased a total of 3,654,816 shares of common stock at a total cost of approximately $98.0 million, leaving $92.0 million available under the Share Repurchase Program as of December 31, 2018. On February 22, 2019, the Parent’s Board authorized a replenishment to its Share Repurchase Program of $158.0 million, bringing the total amount authorized for future share repurchases to $250.0 million. The number of shares to be purchased and the timing of purchases will be based on the Parent’s trading windows and available liquidity, general business and market conditions and other factors, including legal requirements and alternative opportunities. There were no share repurchases during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. All shares repurchased pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program, along with shares repurchased directly from selling stockholders concurrently with previous secondary offerings, are recorded as treasury stock at a total cost of $252.9 million and $154.9 million as of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and are reflected as a reduction to stockholders’ equity in the accompanying condensed balance sheets.
