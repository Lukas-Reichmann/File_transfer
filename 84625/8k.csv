Reports Second Quarter and First Six Months 2019 Results ORLANDO, FL, Aug. 6 , 2019 - SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. (NYSE: SEAS), a leading theme park and entertainment company, today reported its financial results for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal year 2019. Second Quarter 2019 Highlights • Attendance increased by 0.8%, to 6.5 million guests from the second quarter of 2018. • Total revenue increased by 3.6%, to $406.0 million from the second quarter of 2018. • Net income increased by 132.0%, to $52.7 million from the second quarter of 2018. • Adjusted EBITDA [ 1 ] increased by 22.7% to $149.7 million from the second quarter of 2018. First Six Months 2019 Highlights • Attendance increased by 1.7%, to 9.8 million guests from 2018. • Total revenue increased by 2.9%, to $626.6 million from 2018. • Net income was $15.6 million, compared to a net loss of $40.1 million in 2018. • Adjusted EBITDA increased by 33.6%, to $166.1 million from 2018. Other Highlights • As previously announced, the Company repurchased approximately 5.6 million shares of common stock in the second quarter of 2019. • The Company announced an increase in its authorization to buy back shares to $250 million. • In the second quarter of 2019, the Company helped rescue over 780 animals and surpassed 35,000 total rescues over its history. “We are pleased to report another strong quarter of financial results and continued progress towards our 2020 Adjusted EBITDA goal of $475 million to $500 million,” said Gus Antorcha, Chief Executive Officer of SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. “Our second quarter net income of over $52 million and Adjusted EBITDA of over $149 million and our trailing twelve-month net income of over $100 million and Adjusted EBITDA of over $443 million were record-setting results that were driven by both revenue growth and our cost efficiency initiatives.” “As you know, we featured a new ride, attraction and/or event at almost all of our parks this year and guest reception has been positive,” continued Antorcha. “Our exciting summer events are currently in full swing including our one-of-a-kind Sesame Parade in Orlando, San Diego and San Antonio, our award winning Electric Ocean event at each of our SeaWorld parks and our Summer Nights event at each of our Busch Gardens parks, giving our guests even more reasons to visit.” “While we are pleased with our second quarter and first six months results, we have the opportunity to do a lot better,” continued Antorcha. “We will continue to refine our pricing and marketing strategies to drive revenue, improve operating efficiencies and increase operating margins and we are confident we will deliver the significantly improved financial results this Company is capable of achieving.” Second Quarter 2019 Results In the second quarter of 2019, the Company hosted approximately 6.5 million guests, generated total revenues of $406.0 million, net income of $52.7 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $149.7 million. Net income includes approximately $4.3 million of pre-tax expenses associated with a previously announced equity transaction and approximately $0.1 million of pre-tax expenses associated with restructuring and other separation-related costs. Net income in the second quarter of 2018 includes approximately $8.7 million of pre-tax expenses associated with separation-related costs and a legal settlement accrual recorded in the second quarter of 2018. 1 This earnings release includes Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow which are metrics that are not calculated in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”). See “Statement Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section and the financial statement tables for the definitions of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow and the reconciliation of these measures for historical periods to their respective most comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company be lieves attendance in the second quarter was positively impacted by a calendar shift, related primarily to the later timing of Easter and spring break in 2019, as well as a continuation of and refinement of its pricing, marketing and communication strategie s, and the positive reception of its new rides and compelling attractions and events. These factors were offset, largely by unfavorable weather at most of its parks, particularly in the month of June. Revenue was positively impacted by improved in-park pe r capita spending (defined as food, merchandise and other revenue divided by total attendance), an overall increase in attendance, and an increase in admission per capita (defined as admissions revenue divided by total attendance). Adjusted EBITDA was posi tively impacted by an increase in total revenue and the realization of cost savings initiatives. Three Months Ended June 30, Change 2019 2018 % (In millions, except per share and per capita amounts) Total revenues $ 406.0 $ 391.9 3.6 % Net income $ 52.7 $ 22.7 132.0 % Earnings per share, diluted $ 0.64 $ 0.26 146.2 % Adjusted EBITDA $ 149.7 $ 122.0 22.7 % Net cash provided by operating activities $ 129.7 $ 106.5 21.8 % Attendance 6.5 6.4 0.8 % Total revenue per capita $ 62.82 $ 61.10 2.8 % Admission per capita $ 35.25 $ 35.21 0.1 % In-Park per capita spending $ 27.57 $ 25.90 6.4 % First Six Months 2019 Results In the first six months of 2019, the Company hosted approximately 9.8 million guests and generated total revenues of $626.6 million, net income of $15.6 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $166.1 million. Net income includes approximately $4.3 million of pre-tax expenses associated with a previously announced equity transaction and $2.6 million of pre-tax expenses associated with restructuring and other separation-related costs. Net income in the first six months of 2018 includes approximately $30.2 million of pre-tax expenses associated with separation-related costs and legal settlement accruals recorded in the first half of 2018. The Company believes the improved attendance results from a combination of factors including, its refined pricing, marketing and communication strategies and the positive reception of its new rides and compelling attractions and events, along with a favorable calendar shift. These factors were largely offset by unfavorable weather during the period at several of its parks, particularly in the month of June. Revenue was positively impacted by the increases in attendance and in-park per capita spending partially offset by lower admission per capita. Among other factors, the decline in admission per capita primarily results from the continued implementation of new pricing strategies. Adjusted EBITDA was positively impacted by an increase in total revenue and the realization of cost savings initiatives. Six Months Ended June 30, Change 2019 2018 % (In millions, except per share and per capita amounts) Total revenues $ 626.6 $ 609.1 2.9 % Net income (loss) $ 15.6 $ (40.1 ) NM Earnings (loss) per share, diluted $ 0.19 $ (0.47 ) NM Adjusted EBITDA $ 166.1 $ 124.3 33.6 % Net cash provided by operating activities $ 167.4 $ 126.8 32.0 % Attendance 9.8 9.6 1.7 % Total revenue per capita $ 63.92 $ 63.20 1.1 % Admission per capita $ 36.39 $ 36.92 (1.4 %) In-Park per capita spending $ 27.53 $ 26.28 4.8 % Share Repurchases As previously announced, during the second quarter of 2019, the Company repurchased approximately 5.6 million shares of common stock. All of the repurchased common stock were held as treasury shares at June 30, 2019. On August 2, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a replenishment to its previously authorized share repurchase program. The Company now has approximately $250.0 million available for future repurchases under its share repurchase program. 2 Deb t and Liquidity As of June 30, 2019, the Company’s total leverage ratio 2 as calculated under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities was 3.55 to 1.00.

The webcast replay will be available until the Company’s third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. A replay of the call can also be accessed telephonically from 12 p.m. Eastern Time on August 6, 2019 through 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on August 13, 2019 by dialing (877) 344-7529 from anywhere in the U.S., (855) 669-9658 from anywhere in Canada, or (412) 317-0088 from international locations, and entering conference code 10133253 . Statement Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures This earnings release and accompanying financial statement tables include several supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow. Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are not recognized terms under GAAP, should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for a measure of financial performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP and are not indicative of net income or loss or net cash provided by operating activities as determined under GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow and other non-GAAP financial measures have limitations that should be considered before using these measures to evaluate a company’s financial performance or liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to varying methods of calculation. Management believes the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate as it eliminates the effect of certain non-cash and other items not necessarily indicative of a company’s underlying operating performance. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA in connection with certain components of its executive compensation program. In addition, investors, lenders, financial analysts and rating agencies have historically used EBITDA-related measures in the Company’s industry, along with other measures, to estimate the value of a company, to make informed investment decisions and to evaluate companies in the industry. The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA also provides additional information to investors about the calculation of, and compliance with, certain covenants in the Company’s Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Adjusted EBITDA is a material component of these covenants. The financial statement tables that accompany this press release include a reconciliation of historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. However, the Company has not reconciled the forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA long-term goal included in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure because this cannot be done without unreasonable effort due to the seasonal nature of the Company’s business and the high variability, complexity and low visibility with respect to amounts for disposition of assets, income taxes and other expenses and adjusting items which are excluded from the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to assess the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could have a potentially significant impact on its future GAAP financial results.

(a) Reflects restructuring and other separation costs. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 primarily relates to severance and other employment expenses for certain executives whose employment terminated during the first half of 2018. (b) During the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, there were 407,000 and 253,000 anti-dilutive shares of common stock excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share, respectively, and approximately 2,023,000 during the three months ended June 30, 2018. During the six months ended June 30, 2018, there were approximately 3,882,000 potentially dilutive securities excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share, as their effect would have been anti-dilutive due to the Company’s net loss in that period. (c) Reflects the write-off of $8.2 million in debt issuance costs incurred on the Term B-5 Loans during the twelve months ended June 30, 2019. (d) Reflects non-cash equity compensation expenses associated with the grants of equity compensation. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 includes approximately $1.0 million and $5.5 million, respectively, related to equity awards which were accelerated to vest in connection with the departure of certain executives, as required by their respective employment agreements. (e) Reflects primarily non-cash expenses related to miscellaneous fixed asset disposals and impairments. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, primarily reflects asset write-offs related to certain rides and equipment which were removed from service. 7 (f) For the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, reflects business o ptimization, development and other strategic initiative costs primarily related to: (i) $3.6 million and $5.9 million, respectively, of third party consulting costs and (ii) $0.1 million and $2.6 million, respectively, of severance and other employment cos ts associated with positions eliminated. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, reflects business optimization, development and other strategic initiative costs primarily related to: (i) $3.7 million and $12.5 million, respectively, of severance and other employment costs associated with the departure of certain executives during the first quarter and second quarter of 2018; (ii) $3.4 million and $5.4 million, respectively, of third party consulting costs; and (iii) $0.4 million and $1.0 million, respectively, of product and intellectual property development costs. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, reflects business optimization, development and other strategic initiative costs primarily related to: (i) $11.3 million of third party consulting costs and (ii) $7.5 million of severance and other employment costs which includes costs associated with the departure of certain executives during 2018 and other costs related to restructuring programs. Prior to the Amended Credit Agreement, due to limitations under the credit agreement governing the Company’s Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the amount which the Company was able to add back to Adjusted EBITDA for these costs, was limited to $15.0 million in any fiscal year. As such, the Adjusted EBITDA calculation for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 previously reported did not reflect approximately $3.9 million of related costs due to these limitations. (g) For the three, six and twelve months ended June 30, 2019, includes approximately $4.3 million relating to expenses associated with the previously disclosed transfer of shares and related transactions. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, also includes a loss of approximately $2.8 million relating to expenses incurred and fees associated with the termination of an agreement. (h) Reflects the impact of expenses, net of insurance recoveries and adjustments, incurred primarily related to certain legal matters, which the Company is permitted to exclude under the credit agreement governing the Company’s Senior Secured Credit Facilities due to the unusual nature of the items. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, also includes $4.0 million and $12.1 million, respectively, related to legal settlements. Prior to the Amended Credit Agreement, these items were excluded on an after-tax basis only, as such, the Adjusted EBITDA calculation for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 previously reported did not reflect related taxes of approximately $0.4 million and $2.8 million, respectively. (i) Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted to exclude certain non-cash, and other items permitted in calculating covenant compliance under the credit agreement governing the Company’s Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The Adjusted EBITDA presentation for the prior periods has been changed to conform with the current period presentation. In particular, the Adjusted EBITDA calculation was changed to conform with the changes made to its definition in the Amended Credit Agreement. Prior to the Amended Credit Agreement, the credit agreement governing the Company’s Senior Secured Credit Facilities limited the amount of certain add-backs as described in footnotes (f) and (h) above. (j) The Senior Secured Credit Facilities permits the Company’s calculation of certain covenants to be based on Adjusted EBITDA, as defined above, for the last twelve month period further adjusted for net annualized estimated savings the Company expects to realize over the following 18 month period related to certain specified actions, including restructurings and cost savings initiatives. These estimated savings are calculated net of the amount of actual benefits realized during such period. These estimated savings are a non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA add-back item only as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement and does not impact the Company’s reported GAAP net income (loss). The Amended Credit Agreement limits the amount of such estimated savings which may be reflected to 25% of Adjusted EBITDA, calculated for the last twelve months before the impact of these estimated cost savings. Prior to the Amended Credit Agreement, the credit agreement limited the amount of such estimated savings which could be reflected in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA to $10.0 million for any four consecutive fiscal quarters calculated as the amount the Company expected to realize over the following twelve month period. (k) The Senior Secured Credit Facilities permits the Company’s calculation of certain covenants to be based on Adjusted EBITDA, as defined above, for the last twelve month period further adjusted for net annualized estimated savings as described in footnote (j) above. (l) Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures. Management believes that Free Cash Flow is useful to investors, equity analysts and rating agencies as a liquidity measure. The Company uses Free Cash Flow to evaluate its ability to generate c ash flow from business operations. Free Cash Flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, as it excludes certain expenditures such as mandatory debt service requirements, which are significant. Free Cash Flow is not defined by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities or other financial data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Free Cash Flow as defined above may differ from similarly titled measures presented by other companies. (m) Total assets as of June 30, 2019 includes the impact from the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 842, Leases , which required right of use assets associated with the Company’s leases to be recorded on the balance sheet. Right of Use Assets–Operating Leases of approximately $144.6 million are included in total assets as of June 30, 2019. (n) Reflects capital expenditures during the respective period for park rides, attractions and maintenance activities. 8 (o) Reflects capital expenditures during the respective period for park expansion, new properties, revenue and/or expense return on investment (“ROI”) projects. (p) Calculated as total revenues divided by attendance. 9 -;-",0001564902,SEAS,"8-K: UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION WASHINGTON, D.C. 20549 FORM 8-K CURRENT REPORT Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Date of Report (Date of earliest event reported): August 6, 2019 SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc.

Other Highlights • As previously announced, the Company repurchased approximately 5.6 million shares of common stock in the second quarter of 2019. • The Company announced an increase in its authorization to buy back shares to $250 million. • In the second quarter of 2019, the Company helped rescue over 780 animals and surpassed 35,000 total rescues over its history. “We are pleased to report another strong quarter of financial results and continued progress towards our 2020 Adjusted EBITDA goal of $475 million to $500 million,” said Gus Antorcha, Chief Executive Officer of SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. “Our second quarter net income of over $52 million and Adjusted EBITDA of over $149 million and our trailing twelve-month net income of over $100 million and Adjusted EBITDA of over $443 million were record-setting results that were driven by both revenue growth and our cost efficiency initiatives.” “As you know, we featured a new ride, attraction and/or event at almost all of our parks this year and guest reception has been positive,” continued Antorcha. “Our exciting summer events are currently in full swing including our one-of-a-kind Sesame Parade in Orlando, San Diego and San Antonio, our award winning Electric Ocean event at each of our SeaWorld parks and our Summer Nights event at each of our Busch Gardens parks, giving our guests even more reasons to visit.” “While we are pleased with our second quarter and first six months results, we have the opportunity to do a lot better,” continued Antorcha. “We will continue to refine our pricing and marketing strategies to drive revenue, improve operating efficiencies and increase operating margins and we are confident we will deliver the significantly improved financial results this Company is capable of achieving.” Second Quarter 2019 Results In the second quarter of 2019, the Company hosted approximately 6.5 million guests, generated total revenues of $406.0 million, net income of $52.7 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $149.7 million. Net income includes approximately $4.3 million of pre-tax expenses associated with a previously announced equity transaction and approximately $0.1 million of pre-tax expenses associated with restructuring and other separation-related costs. Net income in the second quarter of 2018 includes approximately $8.7 million of pre-tax expenses associated with separation-related costs and a legal settlement accrual recorded in the second quarter of 2018. 1 This earnings release includes Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow which are metrics that are not calculated in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the U.S. (“GAAP”). See “Statement Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section and the financial statement tables for the definitions of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow and the reconciliation of these measures for historical periods to their respective most comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company be lieves attendance in the second quarter was positively impacted by a calendar shift, related primarily to the later timing of Easter and spring break in 2019, as well as a continuation of and refinement of its pricing, marketing and communication strategie s, and the positive reception of its new rides and compelling attractions and events. These factors were offset, largely by unfavorable weather at most of its parks, particularly in the month of June. Revenue was positively impacted by improved in-park pe r capita spending (defined as food, merchandise and other revenue divided by total attendance), an overall increase in attendance, and an increase in admission per capita (defined as admissions revenue divided by total attendance). Adjusted EBITDA was posi tively impacted by an increase in total revenue and the realization of cost savings initiatives.

Net income includes approximately $4.3 million of pre-tax expenses associated with a previously announced equity transaction and $2.6 million of pre-tax expenses associated with restructuring and other separation-related costs. Net income in the first six months of 2018 includes approximately $30.2 million of pre-tax expenses associated with separation-related costs and legal settlement accruals recorded in the first half of 2018. The Company believes the improved attendance results from a combination of factors including, its refined pricing, marketing and communication strategies and the positive reception of its new rides and compelling attractions and events, along with a favorable calendar shift. These factors were largely offset by unfavorable weather during the period at several of its parks, particularly in the month of June. Revenue was positively impacted by the increases in attendance and in-park per capita spending partially offset by lower admission per capita. Among other factors, the decline in admission per capita primarily results from the continued implementation of new pricing strategies. Adjusted EBITDA was positively impacted by an increase in total revenue and the realization of cost savings initiatives.

Statement Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures This earnings release and accompanying financial statement tables include several supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow. Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are not recognized terms under GAAP, should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for a measure of financial performance or liquidity prepared in accordance with GAAP and are not indicative of net income or loss or net cash provided by operating activities as determined under GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow and other non-GAAP financial measures have limitations that should be considered before using these measures to evaluate a company’s financial performance or liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to varying methods of calculation. Management believes the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate as it eliminates the effect of certain non-cash and other items not necessarily indicative of a company’s underlying operating performance. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA in connection with certain components of its executive compensation program. In addition, investors, lenders, financial analysts and rating agencies have historically used EBITDA-related measures in the Company’s industry, along with other measures, to estimate the value of a company, to make informed investment decisions and to evaluate companies in the industry. The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA also provides additional information to investors about the calculation of, and compliance with, certain covenants in the Company’s Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Adjusted EBITDA is a material component of these covenants. The financial statement tables that accompany this press release include a reconciliation of historical non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. However, the Company has not reconciled the forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA long-term goal included in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure because this cannot be done without unreasonable effort due to the seasonal nature of the Company’s business and the high variability, complexity and low visibility with respect to amounts for disposition of assets, income taxes and other expenses and adjusting items which are excluded from the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to assess the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could have a potentially significant impact on its future GAAP financial results.

(a) Reflects restructuring and other separation costs. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 primarily relates to severance and other employment expenses for certain executives whose employment terminated during the first half of 2018. (b) During the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, there were 407,000 and 253,000 anti-dilutive shares of common stock excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share, respectively, and approximately 2,023,000 during the three months ended June 30, 2018. During the six months ended June 30, 2018, there were approximately 3,882,000 potentially dilutive securities excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share, as their effect would have been anti-dilutive due to the Company’s net loss in that period. (c) Reflects the write-off of $8.2 million in debt issuance costs incurred on the Term B-5 Loans during the twelve months ended June 30, 2019. (d) Reflects non-cash equity compensation expenses associated with the grants of equity compensation. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 includes approximately $1.0 million and $5.5 million, respectively, related to equity awards which were accelerated to vest in connection with the departure of certain executives, as required by their respective employment agreements. (e) Reflects primarily non-cash expenses related to miscellaneous fixed asset disposals and impairments. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, primarily reflects asset write-offs related to certain rides and equipment which were removed from service. 7 (f) For the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, reflects business o ptimization, development and other strategic initiative costs primarily related to: (i) $3.6 million and $5.9 million, respectively, of third party consulting costs and (ii) $0.1 million and $2.6 million, respectively, of severance and other employment cos ts associated with positions eliminated. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, reflects business optimization, development and other strategic initiative costs primarily related to: (i) $3.7 million and $12.5 million, respectively, of severance and other employment costs associated with the departure of certain executives during the first quarter and second quarter of 2018; (ii) $3.4 million and $5.4 million, respectively, of third party consulting costs; and (iii) $0.4 million and $1.0 million, respectively, of product and intellectual property development costs. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, reflects business optimization, development and other strategic initiative costs primarily related to: (i) $11.3 million of third party consulting costs and (ii) $7.5 million of severance and other employment costs which includes costs associated with the departure of certain executives during 2018 and other costs related to restructuring programs. Prior to the Amended Credit Agreement, due to limitations under the credit agreement governing the Company’s Senior Secured Credit Facilities, the amount which the Company was able to add back to Adjusted EBITDA for these costs, was limited to $15.0 million in any fiscal year. As such, the Adjusted EBITDA calculation for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 previously reported did not reflect approximately $3.9 million of related costs due to these limitations. (g) For the three, six and twelve months ended June 30, 2019, includes approximately $4.3 million relating to expenses associated with the previously disclosed transfer of shares and related transactions. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, also includes a loss of approximately $2.8 million relating to expenses incurred and fees associated with the termination of an agreement. (h) Reflects the impact of expenses, net of insurance recoveries and adjustments, incurred primarily related to certain legal matters, which the Company is permitted to exclude under the credit agreement governing the Company’s Senior Secured Credit Facilities due to the unusual nature of the items. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, also includes $4.0 million and $12.1 million, respectively, related to legal settlements. Prior to the Amended Credit Agreement, these items were excluded on an after-tax basis only, as such, the Adjusted EBITDA calculation for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 previously reported did not reflect related taxes of approximately $0.4 million and $2.8 million, respectively. (i) Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted to exclude certain non-cash, and other items permitted in calculating covenant compliance under the credit agreement governing the Company’s Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The Adjusted EBITDA presentation for the prior periods has been changed to conform with the current period presentation. In particular, the Adjusted EBITDA calculation was changed to conform with the changes made to its definition in the Amended Credit Agreement. Prior to the Amended Credit Agreement, the credit agreement governing the Company’s Senior Secured Credit Facilities limited the amount of certain add-backs as described in footnotes (f) and (h) above. (j) The Senior Secured Credit Facilities permits the Company’s calculation of certain covenants to be based on Adjusted EBITDA, as defined above, for the last twelve month period further adjusted for net annualized estimated savings the Company expects to realize over the following 18 month period related to certain specified actions, including restructurings and cost savings initiatives. These estimated savings are calculated net of the amount of actual benefits realized during such period. These estimated savings are a non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA add-back item only as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement and does not impact the Company’s reported GAAP net income (loss). The Amended Credit Agreement limits the amount of such estimated savings which may be reflected to 25% of Adjusted EBITDA, calculated for the last twelve months before the impact of these estimated cost savings. Prior to the Amended Credit Agreement, the credit agreement limited the amount of such estimated savings which could be reflected in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA to $10.0 million for any four consecutive fiscal quarters calculated as the amount the Company expected to realize over the following twelve month period. (k) The Senior Secured Credit Facilities permits the Company’s calculation of certain covenants to be based on Adjusted EBITDA, as defined above, for the last twelve month period further adjusted for net annualized estimated savings as described in footnote (j) above. (l) Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures. Management believes that Free Cash Flow is useful to investors, equity analysts and rating agencies as a liquidity measure. The Company uses Free Cash Flow to evaluate its ability to generate c ash flow from business operations. Free Cash Flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, as it excludes certain expenditures such as mandatory debt service requirements, which are significant. Free Cash Flow is not defined by GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities or other financial data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Free Cash Flow as defined above may differ from similarly titled measures presented by other companies. (m) Total assets as of June 30, 2019 includes the impact from the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 842, Leases , which required right of use assets associated with the Company’s leases to be recorded on the balance sheet. Right of Use Assets–Operating Leases of approximately $144.6 million are included in total assets as of June 30, 2019. (n) Reflects capital expenditures during the respective period for park rides, attractions and maintenance activities. 8 (o) Reflects capital expenditures during the respective period for park expansion, new properties, revenue and/or expense return on investment (“ROI”) projects. (p) Calculated as total revenues divided by attendance. 9 "
