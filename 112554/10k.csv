These risks include, but are not limited to the following: - 4 - - 5 - PART I Item 1. Business. Overview We are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on helping patients through the discovery and development of unique RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene therapy and other genetic therapeutic modalities for the treatment of rare diseases. Applying our proprietary, highly-differentiated and innovative technologies, and through collaborations with our strategic partners, we have developed multiple approved products for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (“Duchenne”) and are developing potential therapeutic candidates for a broad range of diseases and disorders, including Duchenne, Limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (“LGMDs”) and other neuromuscular and central nervous system (“CNS”) related disorders. Commercial Products To date, we have developed and commercialized the following approved products for the treatment of Duchenne: Technology and Platforms Exon skipping is intended to promote the production of an internally truncated but functional dystrophin protein. The original PMO structure and variations of this structure that are so-called PMO-based (collectively “PMO-based”) are central to our proprietary chemistry platform. PMO technologies can be used to selectively up-regulate or down-regulate the production of a target protein through pre-mRNA splice alteration. PMO-based compounds have the potential to be designed to create more, less, or none of certain proteins, or produce analogues of endogenous proteins. This technology can be used to correct disease-causing genetic errors by inducing the targeted expression of novel proteins. The PMO chemistry platform is highly adaptable, and we have developed next-generation PMO-based chemistries for advancing RNA-targeted therapeutics. These next-generation chemistries are specifically designed to enhance tissue targeting, intracellular delivery, target selectivity and drug potency. One of these novel technologies is based on cell-penetrating peptide-conjugated PMO (“PPMO”). The PPMO features covalent attachment of a cell-penetrating peptide to a PMO with the goal of enhanced delivery into the cell. Our most advanced PPMO product candidate is SRP-5051, which is designed to treat Duchenne in patients with genetic mutations amenable to exon 51 skipping. As part of our multifaceted approach to Duchenne, we are also developing gene therapy technologies to treat Duchenne. We are clinically developing a product candidate, SRP-9001, that aims to express a smaller but still functional version of dystrophin. We use a unique adeno-associated virus (“AAV”) vector called AAVrh.74 to transport the transgene – the genetic material that will make the protein of interest – to the target cells. A unique, engineered dystrophin is used because naturally-occurring dystrophin is too large to fit in an AAV. We are also developing gene therapy programs for various forms of LGMDs. Our most advanced LGMD product candidate, SRP-9003, is designed to transfer a gene that codes for and restores beta-sarcoglycan protein with the goal of restoring the dystrophin associated protein complex. SRP-9003 utilizes the AAVrh.74 vector, the same vector used in SRP-9001. Our pipeline includes more than 40 programs at various stages of discovery, pre-clinical and clinical development, reflecting our aspiration to apply our multifaceted approach and expertise in precision genetic medicine to make a profound difference in the lives of patients suffering from rare diseases. - 6 - Objectives and Business Strategy We believe that our proprietary technology platforms and collaborations can be used to develop novel pharmaceutical products to treat a broad range of diseases and address key currently-unmet medical needs. We intend to leverage our technology platforms, organizational capabilities, collaborations and resources to lead the field of precision genetic medicines, including the treatment of rare, neuromuscular and other diseases, with a diversified portfolio of product candidates. In pursuit of this objective, we intend to focus on the following activities: Core Therapeutic Areas Duchenne : Duchenne is a rare X-linked recessive genetic disorder affecting children (primarily males) that is characterized by progressive muscle deterioration and weakness. It is the most common type of muscular dystrophy . Duchenne is caused by an absence of dystrophin, a protein that protects muscle cells. The absence of dystrophin in muscle cells leads to significant cell damage and ultimately causes muscle cell death and fibrotic replacement. In the absence of dystrophin protein, affected individuals generally experience the following symptoms, although disease severity and life expectancy vary: LGMDs are autosomal recessive, monogenic, rare neuromuscular diseases caused by missense and deletion mutations. These diseases affect males and females equally. Some types of LGMDs affect skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle. More severe forms of LGMDs mimic Duchenne. LGMDs as a class affect an estimated range of approximately 1 in every 14,500 to 1 in every 123,000 individuals. Currently, there are no approved treatment options for LGMDs. Charcot-Marie-Tooth (“CMT”) Disease is a group of hereditary, degenerative nerve diseases that are caused by mutations in genes that produce proteins involved in the structure and function of either the peripheral nerve axon or the myelin sheath. CMT can cause degeneration of motor skills, resulting in muscle weakness, and limiting patients’ ability to walk or use their hands, and in some cases, can cause degeneration of sensory nerves, resulting in a reduced ability to feel heat, cold, and pain. CMT affects approximately 1 in every 2,500 individuals, while CMT type 1A, which is most often caused by an extra copy of the PMP22 gene, affects approximately 50,000 patients in the U.S. Most patients are diagnosed at infancy, while other patients develop symptoms at adolescence. Currently, there are no available treatment options. - 7 - Our Commercial Products EXONDYS 51 . We launched our first commercial product, EXONDYS 51, in 2016. EXONDYS 51 is indicated for the treatment of Duchenne in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene that is amenable to exon 51 skipping. EXONDYS 51 uses our PMO chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 51 of the dystrophin gene. PMO-based compounds are synthetic compounds that bind to complementary sequences of RNA by standard Watson-Crick nucleobase pairing. The two key structural differences between PMO-based compounds and naturally occurring RNA are that the PMO nucleobases are bound to synthetic morpholino rings instead of ribose rings, and the morpholino rings are linked by phosphorodiamidate groups instead of phosphodiester groups. Replacement of the negatively charged phosphodiester in RNA with the uncharged phosphorodiamidate group in PMO eliminates linkage ionization at physiological pH. Due to these modifications, PMO-based compounds are resistant to degradation by plasma and intracellular enzymes. Unlike the RNA-targeted technologies such as siRNAs and DNA gapmers, PMO-based compounds operate by steric blockade rather than by cellular enzymatic degradation to achieve their biological effects. Thus, PMOs use a fundamentally different mechanism from other RNA-targeted technologies. EXONDYS 51 targets the most frequent series of mutations that cause Duchenne. Approximately 13% of Duchenne patients are amenable to exon 51 skipping. VYONDYS 53 . We launched VYONDYS 53 in 2019. VYONDYS 53 is indicated for the treatment of Duchenne in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene that is amenable to exon 53 skipping. VYONDYS 53 uses our PMO chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 53 of the dystrophin gene. VYONDYS 53 has the potential to treat up to 8% of Duchenne patients who are amenable to exon 53 skipping. AMONDYS 45 . We launched AMONDYS 45 in the first quarter of 2021. AMONDYS 45 is indicated for the treatment of Duchenne in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene that is amenable to exon 45 skipping. AMONDYS 45 uses our PMO chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 45 of the dystrophin gene. AMONDYS 45 has the potential to treat up to 8% of Duchenne patients who are amenable to exon 45 skipping. We are conducting various clinical trials for EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53 AND AMONDYS 45, including studies that are required to comply with our post-marketing FDA requirements and commitments to verify and describe the clinical benefit of the three products. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded net revenues of $843.8 million, $612.4 million and $455.9 million, respectively, related to the sale of our products. Our Pipeline – Key Programs SRP-5051 (Duchenne PPMO program) uses our next-generation chemistry platform, PPMO, and our exon-skipping technology to skip exon 51 of the dystrophin gene. The PPMO technology features covalent attachment of a cell-penetrating peptide to a PMO with the goal of enhanced delivery into the cell. In pre-clinical research, our proprietary class of PPMO compounds demonstrated an increase in dystrophin production and a more durable response compared to PMO. In addition, PPMO treatment in non-human primates resulted in high levels of exon-skipping in skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle tissues. Pre-clinical trials also indicated that PPMOs may require less frequent dosing than PMOs, and that PPMOs could potentially be tailored to reach other organs beyond muscle. In 2019, we commenced a multiple ascending dose study for the treatment of Duchenne with SRP-5051 in patients who are amenable to exon 51 skipping (“Study 5051-201”). In December 2020 and May 2021, we announced results from Part A of Study 5051-201. We initiated Part B of Study 5051-201 in the fourth quarter of 2021 and are currently enrolling. In August 2022, the FDA lifted the clinical hold placed on Study 5051-201 following a serious adverse event of hypomagnesemia. We anticipate Part B of Study 5051-201 to be our potentially pivotal trial. SRP-9001 (Duchenne gene therapy program) aims to express a smaller but still functional version of dystrophin. A unique, engineered dystrophin is used because naturally-occurring dystrophin is too large to fit in an AAV vector. SRP-9001 employs the AAVrh.74 vector, which is designed to be systemically and robustly delivered to skeletal, diaphragm and cardiac muscle without promiscuously crossing the blood brain barrier, which we believe makes it a strong candidate to treat peripheral neuromuscular diseases. An MHCK7 promoter was chosen for its ability to robustly express in the heart, which is critically important for patients with Duchenne, who typically die from pulmonary or cardiac complications. Lastly, the transgene was designed to maintain spectrin-like repeats 2 and 3, which has been reported to be critical to maintaining muscle force. In the fourth quarter of 2017, an investigational new drug (“IND”) application for SRP-9001 was cleared by the FDA, and a Phase 1/2a clinical trial in individuals with Duchenne was initiated (Study 101). In October 2018, Nationwide Children’s Hospital (“Nationwide”) presented results from Study 101 in four individuals with Duchenne enrolled in the trial. In March 2019, we presented - 8 - nine-month functional and creatine kinase (""CK"") data from baseline from these four individuals, and twelve-month CK data from baseline from one of these individuals. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we commenced a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of SRP-9001 with the goal to establish the functional benefits of SRP-9001 protein expression (Study 102). In January 2021, we released top-line results for Part 1 of Study 102 (the 48-week assessment of the 41 participants) and interim expression results from Part 2 of Study 102 (the crossover phase). We announced topline results for Part 2 of Study 102 in January 2022. In May 2021, we announced 12-week expression and safety results from the first 11 participants enrolled in Study 103, an open-label study evaluating the safety and expression of commercially representative material for SRP-9001 (Study 103). In October 2021, we announced functional data from the first 11 patients and tolerability data for all 32 patients enrolled in Study 103. We also initiated our pivotal trial of SRP-9001 for the treatment of Duchenne (Study 301) in October 2021 and expect the data read out in the fourth quarter of 2023. In July 2022, we announced additional data from Study 102 and Study 103. In September 2022, we announced that we submitted a biologics license application (“BLA”) seeking accelerated approval of SRP-9001 for the treatment of ambulant individuals with Duchenne. In November 2022, the FDA accepted for filing and granted priority review for the BLA for SRP-9001 with an anticipated regulatory action date of May 29, 2023. SRP-9003 (LGMD, gene therapy program) . We are developing gene therapy programs for various types of LGMDs. Our LGMD programs use the AAVrh.74 vector, the same vector used in our SRP-9001 gene therapy program, to transfect a restorative gene. The most advanced of our LGMD product candidates, SRP-9003, aims to treat LGMD2E, also known as beta-sarcoglycanopathy, a severe and debilitating form of LGMD characterized by progressive muscle fiber loss, inflammation and muscle fiber replacement with fat and fibrotic tissue. SRP-9003 is designed to transfect a gene that codes for and restores beta-sarcoglycan protein with the goal of restoring the dystrophin associated protein complex. SRP-9003 has generated positive pre-clinical safety and efficacy data utilizing the AAVrh.74 vector. A Phase 1/2a trial of SRP-9003 commenced in the fourth quarter of 2018. In February 2019, we announced two-month biopsy data from the first three-patient cohort dosed in the SRP-9003 trial, and in October 2019, we announced nine-month functional data from these three patients. In June 2020, we announced safety and expression results from three clinical trial participants in the high-dose cohort measured at 60 days, and one-year functional data from three clinical trial participants in the low-dose cohort. In September 2020, we announced six-month functional data from three clinical trial participants in the in the high-dose cohort, and eighteen-month functional data from three clinical trial participants in the low-dose cohort. We also announced one-year functional data in the high-dose cohort and two-year functional data in the low-dose cohort in March 2021. In March 2022, we announced 36-month functional data from three clinical trial participants in the low-dose cohort and 24-month functional data from two clinical trial participants in the high-dose cohort. We plan to meet with the FDA in 2023 to discuss our potentially pivotal trial. - 9 - The chart below summarizes the status of our programs, including those with our strategic partners: - 10 - Manufacturing, Supply and Distribution We have developed proprietary state-of-the-art Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (“CMC”) and manufacturing capabilities that allow manufacturing and testing of our products and product candidates to support both clinical development as well as commercialization. We continue to refine and optimize our manufacturing processes. We have entered into certain manufacturing and supply arrangements with third-party suppliers which will in part utilize these capabilities to support production of certain of our product candidates and their components. In 2017, we opened a facility in Andover, Massachusetts, which significantly enhanced our research and development manufacturing capabilities. However, we currently do not have internal large-scale Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMP”) manufacturing capabilities to produce our products and product candidates for commercial and/or clinical use. For our current and future manufacturing needs, we have entered into supply agreements with specialized contract manufacturing organizations (each a “CMO”) to produce custom raw materials, the active pharmaceutical ingredients (“APIs”), drug product and finished goods for our products and product candidates for both commercial and clinical use. All of our CMO partners have extensive technical expertise, GMP experience and experience manufacturing our specific technology. For our commercial products, we have worked with our existing CMOs to increase product capacity from mid-scale to large-scale. While there is a limited number of companies that can produce raw materials and APIs in the quantities and with the quality and purity that we require for our commercial products, based on our diligence to date, we believe our current network of CMOs is able to fulfill these requirements, and is capable of expanding capacity as needed. Additionally, we have, and will continue to evaluate further relationships with additional suppliers to increase overall capacity as well as further reduce risks associated with reliance on a limited number of suppliers for manufacturing. Our commercial products are distributed in the U.S. through a limited network of home infusion specialty pharmacy providers that deliver the medication to patients and a specialty distributor that distributes our products to hospitals and hospital outpatient clinics. With respect to the pre-commercial distribution of our products to patients outside of the U.S., we have contracted with third party distributors and service providers to distribute our products in certain countries through our EAPs. We plan to continue building out our network for commercial distribution in jurisdictions in which our products are approved. Our gene therapy manufacturing capabilities have been greatly enhanced through partnerships with Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (“Thermo”), Catalent, Inc. (“Catalent”) and Aldevron LLC (“Aldevron”). We have adopted a hybrid development and manufacturing strategy in which we are building internal manufacturing expertise relative to all aspects of AAV-based manufacturing, including gene therapy and gene editing supply, while closely partnering with manufacturing partners to expedite development and commercialization of our gene therapy programs. We expect that our partnerships with Thermo and Catalent will support our clinical and commercial manufacturing capacity for our SRP-9001 Duchenne program and LGMD programs, while also acting as a manufacturing platform for potential future gene therapy programs. The collaboration integrates process development, clinical production and testing, and commercial manufacturing. Aldevron is providing GMP-grade plasmid for our SRP-9001 Duchenne program and LGMD programs, as well as plasmid source material for future gene therapy programs, such as CMT and other neuromuscular and CNS related disorders. Manufacturers and suppliers of our commercial products and product candidates are subject to the FDA’s current GMP (“cGMP”) requirements and other rules and regulations prescribed by foreign regulatory authorities. We depend on our third-party partners for continued compliance with cGMP requirements and applicable foreign standards. Material Agreements We believe that our RNA-targeted and gene therapy technologies could be broadly applicable for the potential development of pharmaceutical products in many therapeutic areas. To enhance and further exploit our core technologies, we have and may continue to enter into research, development or commercialization alliances with universities, hospitals, independent research centers, non-profit organizations, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and other entities for new technologies, including for specific molecular targets or selected disease indications. We may also selectively pursue opportunities to access certain intellectual property rights that complement our internal portfolio through license agreements or other arrangements. F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd License, Collaboration, and Option Agreement On December 21, 2019, we entered into a license, collaboration, and option agreement (the “Collaboration Agreement”) with F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd (“Roche”) pursuant to which we granted Roche an exclusive license under certain of our intellectual property rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize SRP-9001 in all countries outside of the U.S. We retained all rights to SRP-9001 in the U.S. The transaction closed on February 4, 2020. We have entered into Amendments 1 through 10 to the Collaboration Agreement on: October 23, 2020, October 28, 2020, February 4, 2021, June 23, 2021, August 31, 2021, November 30, 2021, January 5, 2022, January 28, 2022, April 4, 2022, and July 26, 2022, respectively. - 11 - Also, under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, Roche granted us a license to use certain of its intellectual property rights to perform development activities worldwide under a joint global development plan, commercialize SRP-9001 in the U.S., and perform certain manufacturing and medical affairs activities worldwide. Such license is non-exclusive under Roche’s background intellectual property rights, exclusive in the U.S. under intellectual property rights developed by Roche under the Collaboration Agreement, and non-exclusive outside the U.S. under intellectual property rights developed by Roche under the Collaboration Agreement. We intend to manufacture and supply all clinical and, upon approval in the relevant market, commercial supply of SRP-9001. Roche Options and Negotiation Rights Pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, we granted Roche an exclusive option to obtain an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize the following products outside of the U.S.: (i) certain exon-skipping products that target the dystrophin gene to induce exon skipping, including eteplirsen, golodirsen, casimersen and SRP-5051; (ii) certain gene therapy products other than SRP-9001 that encode and directly express dystrophin or a derivative thereof; and (iii) certain gene-editing products that modify, repair, or activate an endogenous dysfunctional dystrophin gene. The products subject to Roche’s options are collectively referred to as the “Option Products.” Upon option exercise, the Option Product that is the subject of the option exercise will be included under the Collaboration Agreement as a product licensed to Roche subject to similar obligations, including with respect to development, manufacturing, commercialization, and cost-sharing as those that apply to SRP-9001. Pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, Roche has a right of first negotiation if we seek to grant a third-party license to commercialize SRP-9001 in the U.S. Roche had a similar right of first negotiation with respect to our LGMDs products, but such right has expired. Exclusivity Other than under the Collaboration Agreement, Roche may not perform any clinical trials for, or commercialize, any gene therapy product, gene-editing product, or antisense oligonucleotide for Duchenne for a period of five years following the execution of the Collaboration Agreement. The exclusivity period for one or more types of products may be extended if Roche exercises its option with respect to one or more exon-skipping products, gene therapy products, or gene-editing products, in each case, for a period of five years from the time of option exercise. Development The parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct development activities with respect to SRP-9001 under the Collaboration Agreement pursuant to agreed-upon development plans. Subject to certain exceptions, we will perform all development activities directed to obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for SRP-9001 in the U.S. and the EU, as set forth in a joint global development plan. Subject to certain exceptions, the parties will share the costs of the development activities under such joint global development plan. Roche will have sole responsibility to perform all development activities set forth in a territory-specific development plan for SRP-9001, including additional activities not set forth in the joint global development plan that are specifically directed to obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for SRP-9001 outside of the U.S. Roche will be solely responsible for costs arising from the territory-specific development plan for SRP-9001. Governance Governing committees will facilitate collaboration between the parties with respect to development, manufacturing, medical affairs, intellectual property protection, and commercialization of SRP-9001 and any other licensed products. Financial Terms In consideration for the rights that we granted and for prepaid funding for development activities, in February 2020, Roche and Roche Finance Ltd, an affiliate of Roche (“Roche Finance”), together paid us an up-front payment of approximately $1.2 billion. Of the $1.2 billion cash received from Roche, (i) $312.1 million, net of issuance costs, was allocated to the approximately 2.5 million shares of our common stock issued to Roche based on the closing price when the shares were issued, (ii) $485.0 million was allocated to the option to purchase the Option Products, and (iii) $348.7 million was allocated to a single, combined performance obligation comprised of: (i) the license of IP relating to SRP-9001 transferred to Roche, (ii) the related research and development services provided under the joint global development plan, (iii) the services provided to manufacture clinical supplies of SRP-9001, and (iv) our participation in a joint steering committee with Roche, because we determined that the license of IP and related activities were not capable of being distinct from one another. Additionally, we are eligible to receive up to $1.7 billion in development, regulatory and sales milestone payments with respect to SRP-9001. - 12 - In addition, the Collaboration Agreement provides that Roche will pay us royalties on net sales of SRP-9001, at a tiered royalty rate based on the average cost to manufacture SRP-9001. In the event that Roche chooses to exercise its option with respect to one or more Option Products, we will be paid an option exercise fee upon each such exercise and the Option Products that are the subject of the option exercise will be subject to separate milestone payments and royalties on sales of such Option Product. Term; Termination Unless earlier terminated as described below, the Collaboration Agreement will continue with respect to SRP-9001 or any Option Product for which Roche has exercised its option, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until the end of the royalty term for such product in such country. The royalty term expires on the later of (a) twelve years after first commercial sale in such country, (b) loss of regulatory exclusivity in such country and (c) expiration of all valid claims of specific licensed patents in such country. Either party may terminate the Collaboration Agreement for the other party’s material breach if such breach is not cured within a specified cure period. If Roche breaches its development or commercialization diligence obligations with respect to a licensed product or fails to develop or commercialize a particular licensed product in a particular region for a specified period of time, then we may terminate the Collaboration Agreement with respect to such licensed products in such regions. Roche may terminate the Collaboration Agreement if we fail to supply SRP-9001 to Roche in accordance with the terms of the Collaboration Agreement and the supply agreements to be entered into between the parties. Roche may also terminate the Collaboration Agreement for convenience with extended advance notice, in its entirety or on a licensed product-by-licensed product and region-by-region basis. The foregoing description of the terms of the Collaboration Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Collaboration Agreement, a copy of which is filed as an exhibit to this Annual Report. Myonexus Therapeutics Inc. On May 3, 2018, we purchased from Myonexus Therapeutics Inc. (“Myonexus”), a privately-held Delaware corporation, a warrant to purchase common stock of Myonexus (the “Warrant”), which, in combination with amendments to the Myonexus certificate of incorporation, provided us with an exclusive option (the “Option”) to acquire Myonexus. In consideration for the Warrant, we made an up-front payment of $60.0 million to Myonexus. On February 27, 2019, we announced that we exercised the exclusive option to acquire Myonexus and, on April 4, 2019, we paid the Myonexus shareholders approximately $173.8 million and completed the acquisition of Myonexus. As part of the consideration for the transaction, we are required to make contingent payments to the former shareholders of Myonexus upon achievement of a threshold amount of net sales of Myonexus products and the receipt and subsequent sale of a Priority Review Voucher (“PRV”) with respect to a Myonexus product. BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. License Agreement On July 17, 2017, we executed a license agreement (as amended on April 14, 2019 and November 17, 2021, the “License Agreement”) with BioMarin Leiden Holding BV, BioMarin Nederlands BV and BioMarin Technologies BV (collectively, “BioMarin”), pursuant to which BioMarin granted us a royalty-bearing, worldwide license under patent rights (“Licensed Patents”) and know-how (“Licensed Know-How”) controlled by BioMarin with respect to BioMarin’s Duchenne program, which are potentially necessary or useful for the treatment of Duchenne, to practice and exploit the Licensed Patents and Licensed Know-How in all fields of use and for all purposes, including to develop and commercialize antisense oligonucleotide products that target one or more exons of the dystrophin gene to induce exon skipping, including eteplirsen, golodirsen and casimersen (collectively, the “Products”). The license granted to us by BioMarin is co-exclusive with BioMarin, with respect to the Licensed Patents, and is non-exclusive with respect to Licensed Know-How. Pursuant to the amendment to the License Agreement dated November 17, 2021 (the “2021 Amendment”), BioMarin exercised its right to convert the exclusive license under the Licensed Patents to the current co-exclusive license. - 13 - Under the terms of the License Agreement, we were required to pay BioMarin an up-front payment of $15.0 million. Pursuant to the 2021 Amendment, BioMarin is eligible to receive up to $20.0 million from us per dystrophin gene exon (other than exon 51) targeted by one or more Products in specified regulatory milestones, as well as an additional $10.0 million milestone, payable following the regulatory approval of eteplirsen by the EMA. BioMarin is also eligible to receive through June 30, 2022 royalties segmented by specified geographic markets, in some jurisdictions dependent on the existence of a patent, ranging from 4% to 8% of net sales on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis. Beginning July 1, 2022, pursuant to the 2021 Amendment, BioMarin was eligible to receive royalties of 4% in the U.S. and 5% outside the U.S. of net sales of Products covered by a Licensed Patent on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis. Milestones and royalties are payable with respect to the Products through June 30, 2022. Beginning July 1, 2022, pursuant to the 2021 Amendment, milestones and royalties are payable only with respect to the Products covered by a Licensed Patent. Beginning July 1, 2022, pursuant to the 2021 Amendment, the royalty term applicable to the Products covered by a Licensed Patent will expire upon March 31, 2024 in the U.S. and December 31, 2024 outside the U.S. The royalties for all Products covered by a Licensed Patent are subject to reductions, including for generic competition and, under specified conditions, for a specified portion of payments that we may become required to pay under third-party license agreements, subject to a maximum royalty reduction. Unless earlier terminated, the License Agreement will expire upon the expiration of the last-to-expire royalty term. Either party may terminate the License Agreement in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach. BioMarin may also terminate the License Agreement on a Licensed Patent-by-Licensed Patent basis under specified circumstances relating to patent challenges by us. Settlement Agreement On July 17, 2017, Sarepta and The University of Western Australia (“UWA”) on the one hand, and the BioMarin Parties and Academisch Ziekenhuis Leiden (“AZL”) on the other hand (collectively, the “Settlement Parties”), executed a Settlement Agreement pursuant to which all legal actions in the U.S. and certain legal actions in Europe (the “Actions”) would be stopped or withdrawn as between the Settlement Parties. Specifically, the terms of the Settlement Agreement required that existing efforts pursuing ongoing litigation and opposition proceedings would be stopped as between the Settlement Parties, and the Settlement Parties would cooperate to withdraw the Actions before the European Patent Office (except for actions involving third parties), the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the High Court of Justice of England and Wales, except for the cross-appeal of the Interlocutory Decision of the Opposition Division dated April 15, 2013 of the European Patent Office of EP 1619249B1 (“EP ‘249 Appeal”) in which Sarepta agreed to withdraw its appeal and BioMarin/AZL agreed to continue with its appeal with Sarepta having oversight of the continued appeal by BioMarin/AZL. Additionally, under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the Settlement Parties agreed to release each other and the customers, end-users, agents, suppliers, distributors, resellers, contractors, consultants, services and partners of Sarepta or BioMarin (as applicable) from claims and damages related to (i) the patent rights controlled by the releasing party that are involved in the Actions, (ii) with respect to Sarepta and UWA, its patent rights related to the patent rights involved in the Actions, and (iii) with respect to BioMarin and AZL, all of the Licensed Patents and Licensed Know-How. Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, we made an up-front payment of $20.0 million to BioMarin. University of Western Australia In April 2013, we entered into an agreement with UWA under which an existing exclusive license agreement between the two parties was amended and restated and, in June 2016, we entered into the first amendment to the license agreement (the “UWA License Agreement”). The UWA License Agreement grants us specific rights to compounds for the treatment of Duchenne by inducing exon skipping. EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53 and AMONDYS 45 fall under the scope of the license agreement. Under the UWA License Agreement, we are required to make payments of up to $6.0 million in the aggregate to UWA based on the successful achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones relating to EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53, AMONDYS 45 and up to three additional product candidates. As of December 31, 2022, $4.2 million of the $6.0 million development and regulatory milestone payments had been made. We are also obligated to make payments to UWA of up to $20.0 million upon the achievement of certain sales milestones. Additionally, we are required to pay a low-single-digit percentage royalty on net sales of products covered by issued patents licensed from UWA during the term of the UWA License Agreement. Currently, the latest date on which an issued patent covered by the UWA License Agreement expires is November 2030 (excluding any patent term extension, supplemental protection certificate or pediatric extensions that may be available); however, patents granted from pending patent applications could result in a later expiration date. - 14 - Patents and Proprietary Rights Our success depends in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain exclusivity for our products, product candidates and platform technologies. We typically rely on a combination of patent protection and regulatory exclusivity to maintain exclusivity for our products and product candidates, whereas exclusivity for our platform technologies is generally based on patent protection and trade secret protection. In addition to patent protection, regulatory exclusivity, and trade secret protection, we also protect our products, product candidates and platform technologies with copyrights, trademarks, and contractual protections. We actively seek patent protection for our product candidates and certain of our proprietary technologies by filing patent applications in the U.S. and other countries as appropriate. These patent applications are directed to various inventions, including, but not limited to, active ingredients, pharmaceutical formulations, methods of use, and manufacturing methods. In addition, we actively acquire exclusive rights to third party patents and patent applications to protect our in-licensed product candidates and corresponding platform technologies. We do not have patents or patent applications in every jurisdiction where there is a potential commercial market for our product candidates. For each of our programs, our decision to seek patent protection in specific foreign markets, in addition to the U.S., is based on many factors, including: We continually evaluate our patent portfolio and patent strategy and believe our owned and licensed patents and patent applications provide us with a competitive advantage; however, if markets where we do not have patents or patent applications become commercially important, our business may be adversely affected. A discussion of certain risks and uncertainties that may affect our freedom to operate, patent position, regulatory exclusivities and other proprietary rights is set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors included in this report, and a discussion of legal proceedings related to the key patents protecting our products and product candidates are set forth below in the footnotes to the tables in this section. Certain of our product candidates are in therapeutic areas that have been the subject of many years of extensive research and development by academic organizations and third parties who may control patents or other intellectual property that they might assert against us, should one or more of our product candidates in these therapeutic areas succeed in obtaining regulatory approval and thereafter be commercialized. We continually evaluate the intellectual property rights of others in these areas in order to determine whether a claim of infringement may be made by others against us. Should we determine that a third party has intellectual property rights that could impact our ability to freely market a compound, we consider a number of factors in determining how best to prepare for the commercialization of any such product candidate. In making this determination we consider, among other things, the stage of development of our product candidate, the anticipated date of first regulatory approval, whether we believe the intellectual property rights of others are valid, whether we believe we infringe the intellectual property rights of others, whether a license is available upon commercially reasonable terms, whether we will seek to challenge the intellectual property rights of others, the term of the rights, and the likelihood of and liability resulting from an adverse outcome should we be found to infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Currently, U.S. patents, as well as most foreign patents, are generally effective for 20 years from the date the earliest regular application was filed. In some countries, the patent term may be extended to recapture a portion of the term lost during regulatory review of the claimed therapeutic. For example, in the U.S., under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may be eligible for patent term extension (for up to 5 years, but not beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval) as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. In the U.S., only one patent may be extended for any product based on FDA delay. In addition to patent term extension, patents in the U.S. may be granted additional term due to delays at the USPTO during prosecution of a patent application. We actively strive to maximize the potential for patent protection for our products and product candidates in accordance with the law. - 15 - Key Patents & Regulatory Exclusivities Our products, product candidates and our technologies are primarily protected by composition of matter and methods of use patents and patent applications. A summary of granted composition of matter and/or methods of use patents that we solely own or control (or in the case of BioMarin/AZL patents, control with BioMarin), which cover our products in the U.S. and Europe, is provided below. To the extent the product indicated above the tables that immediately follow the name of such product is covered by a patent that is licensed to Sarepta, we may owe milestones and/or royalties to the indicated licensor in connection with the development and/or commercial sale of the product.

In connection with its FDA approval on February 25, 2021, the FDA granted AMONDYS 45 (casimersen) NCE exclusivity until February 25, 2026, and Orphan Drug Exclusivity until February 25, 2028. * Granted patents in the U.S. and Europe (EP) are shown here. Additional patent protection in the U.S., Europe (EP) or other countries or regions through pending or granted foreign counterparts may be available. ** Stated expiration dates do not account for any patent term extension, supplemental protection certificate or pediatric extensions that may be available. In addition to the foregoing composition of matter and method of use patents that protect eteplirsen, casimersen and golodirsen, we either solely own or control (or in the case of BioMarin/AZL patents, control with BioMarin) patents and patent applications in the U.S. and in major foreign markets that, if granted, provide additional protection for eteplirsen, casimersen, and golodirsen, which cover the composition of matter, preparation and/or uses of the products. These patents, and patent applications, if - 17 - granted, would expire through at least 2038, such expiration dates not accounting for any patent term extension, patent term adjustment, supplemental protection certificate or pediatric extensions that may be available. Platform Technologies We separately own patents and patent applications in the U.S. and in major foreign markets that cover our proprietary PMO-based platform technologies (e.g., PPMO) relevant to our products. These patents, and patent applications, if granted, expire through at least 2038, such expiration dates not accounting for any patent term extension, supplemental protection certificate or pediatric extensions that may be available. Trademarks Our trademarks are important to us and are generally filed to protect our corporate brand, our products and platform technologies. We typically file trademark applications and pursue their registration in the U.S., Europe and other markets in which we anticipate using such trademarks. We are the owner of multiple federal trademark registrations in the U.S. including, but not limited to, Sarepta, Sarepta Therapeutics, the double-helix logo, EXONDYS, EXONDYS 51, the EXONDYS 51 Logo, VYONDYS, VYONDYS 53, the VYONDYS 53 Logo, AMONDYS, AMONDYS 45, and the AMONDYS 45 Logo. In addition, we have multiple pending trademark applications and registrations in the U.S. and in major foreign markets. Trademark protection varies in accordance with local law, and continues in some countries as long as the trademark is used and in other countries as long as the trademark is registered. Trademark registrations generally are for fixed but renewable terms. Government Regulation The testing, manufacturing, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, exportation and marketing of our products are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S. and in other countries. In the U.S., the FDA, under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations, regulates pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending marketing applications, withdrawal of approval of approved products, warning letters, untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, civil penalties and/or criminal prosecution. U.S. Drug Approval Process To obtain FDA approval of a product candidate, we must, among other things, submit clinical data providing substantial evidence of safety and efficacy of the product for its intended use, as well as detailed information on product composition, its manufacture and controls and proposed labeling. The testing and collection of data and the preparation of necessary applications are expensive and time-consuming. The FDA may not act quickly or favorably in reviewing these applications, and we may encounter significant difficulties or costs in our efforts to obtain FDA approvals that could delay or preclude us from marketing our products. The steps required before a drug may be approved for marketing in the U.S. generally include the following: - 18 - Pre-clinical trials may include laboratory evaluations of the product chemistry, pharmacology, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the pharmacokinetics, metabolism, bio-distribution, elimination and toxicity of the product candidate. The conduct of the pre-clinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with federal regulations and requirements. The results of the pre-clinical trials, manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed first in human clinical trial protocol are submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may be initiated. The IND will become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions about the supportive data, or the study design, particularly regarding potential safety issues with conducting the clinical trial as described in the protocol. In this situation, the trials are placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns before clinical trials can proceed. Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patient participants under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the study, the administration of the investigational product, subject selection and exclusion criteria, study procedures, parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as a submission to the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”) requirements and federal and state laws and regulations protecting study subjects. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by the IRB at or servicing each institution in which the clinical trial will be conducted. The IRB will consider, among other things, rationale for conducting the trial, clinical trial design, participant informed consent, ethical factors, the safety and rights of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution. The FDA can temporarily or permanently halt a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial subjects. The IRB may also require the clinical trial at a particular site be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with GCP or the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions. Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential drug development phases (Phases 1, 2 and 3) prior to approval, and a portion of these phases may overlap. A fourth post-approval phase (Phase 4) may include additional clinical trials. A general description of clinical trials conducted in each phase of development is provided below. However, the number of study subjects involved in each phase of drug development for rare diseases can be significantly less than typically expected for more common diseases with larger patient populations: - 19 - A company seeking marketing approval for a new drug in the U.S. must submit the results of the pre-clinical and clinical trials to the FDA in the form of a marketing application, together with, among other things, detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product candidate and proposed labeling, including payment of a user fee for FDA review of the application. The user fee is waived for an application for a product intended to treat an Orphan Indication. The FDA assesses all submitted marketing applications for completeness before it accepts them for filing. In some cases, the FDA may request additional information before accepting a marketing application for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the marketing application. Applications receive either standard or priority review. Under the current goals mandated under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (the “PDUFA”), the FDA has ten months in which to complete its initial review of a standard marketing application and respond to the applicant, and six months for a priority marketing application. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard or priority marketing applications. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the marketing application sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date. The FDA may refer an application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. Though the FDA is not bound by such recommendations, it considers them carefully when making decisions. If the FDA’s evaluations of the marketing application and the clinical and manufacturing procedures and facilities are favorable, the FDA may issue an approval letter. If the FDA finds deficiencies in the marketing application, it may issue a complete response letter, which defines the conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the marketing application. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will issue an approval letter, authorizing commercial marketing of the drug. Sponsors that receive a complete response letter may submit to the FDA information that represents a complete response to the issues identified by the FDA. Resubmissions by the marketing application sponsor in response to a complete response letter trigger new review periods of varying length (typically two to six months) based on the content of the resubmission. If the FDA’s evaluation of the marketing application and the commercial manufacturing procedures and facilities is not favorable, the FDA may not approve the marketing application. A sponsor may also seek designation of its drug candidates under programs designed to accelerate the FDA’s review and potential approval of marketing applications. For instance, a sponsor may seek FDA designation of a drug candidate as a “fast track product.” Fast track products are those products intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. If fast track designation is obtained, the FDA may initiate early and frequent communication and begin reviewing sections of a marketing application before the application is complete. This “rolling review” is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the remaining information. Eteplirsen was granted fast track status in 2007. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (“FDASIA”) enacted and signed into law in 2012 amended the criteria for the fast track and accelerated approval pathways and, as a result, the pathways now share many common eligibility criteria. FDASIA provides both the sponsor companies and the FDA with greater flexibility and expedited regulatory mechanisms. The statute clarifies that a fast track product may be approved pursuant to an accelerated approval (Subpart – H) or under the traditional approval process. In addition, FDASIA codified the accelerated approval pathway as separate and apart from the fast track pathway, meaning that for drugs to be eligible for accelerated approval, they do not need to be designated under the fast track pathway. FDASIA reinforces the FDA’s authority to grant accelerated approval of a drug that treats a serious condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies and demonstrates an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality (“IMM”) that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit (i.e., an intermediate clinical endpoint). Approvals of this kind typically include requirements for appropriate post-approval Phase 4 clinical trials to confirm clinical benefit. FDASIA retains this requirement and further requires those studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. The Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022 (“FDORA”) signed by President Biden on December 29, 2022 as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 (H.R. 2617) includes numerous reforms to the accelerated approval process for drugs and biologics and enables FDA to require, as appropriate, that a post-approval study be underway prior to granting accelerated approval. FDORA also expands the expedited withdrawal procedures already available to FDA to allow the agency to use expedited procedures if a sponsor fails to conduct any required post-approval study of the product with due diligence including with respect to “conditions specified by the Secretary of HHS.” FDORA also adds the failure of a sponsor of a product approved under accelerated approval to conduct with due diligence any required post-approval study with respect to such product or to submit timely reports with respect to such product to the list of prohibited acts in the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Additionally, FDASIA established a new, expedited regulatory mechanism referred to as breakthrough therapy designation. Breakthrough therapy designation, fast track, and accelerated approval are not mutually exclusive and are meant to serve different purposes. The breakthrough therapy designation is focused on expediting the development and review process and by itself does not create an alternate ground for product approval. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of a drug candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the drug is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or - 20 - more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA issued guidance entitled “Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions––Drugs and Biologics” in May 2014. Finally, if a drug candidate demonstrates a significant benefit over existing therapy, it may be eligible for priority review, which means it will be reviewed within a six-month timeframe from the date a complete marketing application is accepted for filing. A Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (“RMAT”) designation is also designed to accelerate approval for regenerative advanced therapies such as our gene therapy product candidates, but the exact mechanisms have not yet been announced by FDA. We cannot be sure that any of our drug candidates will qualify for any of these expedited development, review and approval programs, or that, if a drug does qualify, that the product candidates will be approved, will be accepted as part of any such program or that the review time will be shorter than a standard review. Holders of an approved marketing application are required to: The FDA periodically inspects the sponsor’s records related to safety reporting and/or manufacturing; this latter effort includes assessment of compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved marketing application, including withdrawal of the product from the market. Foreign Regulatory Requirements In 2018, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) within the EMA confirmed its negative opinion for eteplirsen, and the European Commission adopted the CHMP opinion. As of the date of this Annual Report, EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53 and AMONDYS 45 have only been approved for sale and marketing in the U.S. by the FDA, and EXONDYS 51 has been approved in addition for sale and marketing in Israel by the Israeli Ministry of Health. Thus, in addition to regulations in the U.S., our business is subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Irrespective of whether it concerns an FDA approved or investigational drug, the commencement of clinical trials and the subsequent marketing of a drug product in foreign countries are subject to preliminary approvals from the corresponding regulatory authorities of such countries. For example, the conduct of clinical trials in the EU is governed by the Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 and the principles and guidelines on GCP. In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) (the ""Regulation"") No 536/2014 to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. Although the new Regulation has been adopted and has entered into force in 2014, it only came into application in the EU Member States six months after the EC confirmed the functionality of the new Clinical Trials Information System (“CTIS”), which includes the centralized EU portal and database for clinical trials introduced by the Regulation. On July 31, 2021, the EC published a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union, confirming full functionality of the EU portal and database. The Regulation has, consequently, entered into application on January 31, 2022 and has repealed the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and its national implementation legislations. However, it does foresee in a three-year transition period. During the first year, until January 31, 2023, sponsors of clinical trials were able to choose whether to file a clinical trial application (“CTA”) under the regime of the Directive, using the EudraCT, or under the Regulation, using the CTIS. As of the second year, all new CTAs must be submitted under the Regulation, via the CTIS. Clinical trials that were submitted under the Directive prior to January 31, 2023, will be allowed to continue under the old regime until the end of the transition period, but sponsors may also opt to transition ongoing trials on a voluntary basis. By January 31, 2025, all clinical trials that had been authorized under the Directive, must either have ended in the EU and European Economic Area (the “EEA”), or have been transitioned to the new regime. No legislation needs to be adopted to implement the new Regulation into national EU Member State law as it is directly applicable. The new Regulation provides an overhaul of the system, in order to harmonize the assessment of the submission and assessment of clinical trials conducted in EU Member States and to ensure greater consistency with the highest standards of patient safety in the EU. Under the Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC and the Commission Directive 2005/28/EC laying down the requirements for the conduct of clinical trials in the - 21 - EU, a sponsor had to obtain approval from the competent national authority of the member state of the EU (“EU Member State”) in which the clinical trial would be conducted, or in multiple EU Member States if the clinical trial would be conducted in a number of countries. Furthermore, the sponsor could only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee issued a favorable opinion. The CTA had to include the supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC, corresponding national laws of the EU Member States, and as further detailed in the applicable guidance documents. In contrast, the new legislation seeks to simplify and streamline approval of the clinical trials. Under the new coordinated procedure, the sponsor of a clinical trial is required to submit a single application to a reporting EU Member State via the centralized EU portal in the CTIS. The reporting EU Member State will consult and coordinate with all other EU Member States in which the clinical trial is planned to be conducted. If the application is rejected, it can be amended and resubmitted through the central EU portal in the CTIS. If an approval is issued, the sponsor can start the clinical trial in all EU Member States concerned. However, an EU Member State can in certain cases declare an “opt-out” from the approval. In such a case, the clinical trial cannot be conducted in such EU Member State(s). The Regulation also aims to streamline and simplify the rules on safety reporting for clinical trials. In order to obtain marketing authorization for a medicinal product in the EU, applicants are required to submit a marketing authorization application (""MAA"") to either (a) the national competent authorities (through the decentralized, mutual recognition, or national procedures) or (b) the EMA (through the centralized authorization procedure). Applicants are required to demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicinal product in the application for marketing authorization, which implies the requirement to conduct human clinical trials to generate the necessary clinical data. Furthermore, all applications for marketing authorization for new medicines have to include the results of studies as described in an agreed pediatric investigation plan (“PIP”) aimed at ensuring that the necessary data are obtained through studies in children, unless the medicine is exempt because of a deferral or waiver. Deferrals allow an applicant to delay development of the medicine in children until, for instance, there is enough information to demonstrate its effectiveness and safety in adults. Waivers, on the other hand, may be granted when the development of a medicine in children is not needed or is not appropriate, such as for diseases that only affect the adult population. Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down the rules applicable to the centralized procedure for the authorization of medicinal products. The centralized procedure allows pharmaceutical companies to submit a single application to the EMA, which is followed by a single evaluation and which results in a single approval to market the medicinal product throughout the EEA, on the basis of a single market authorization. Approval via the centralized procedure is a two-step process whereby the CHMP first evaluates the MAA and issues an opinion on whether the medicinal product may be authorized or not (step 1). The CHMP opinion is subsequently sent to the EC, which takes a legally binding decision to grant a marketing authorization (step 2). The marketing authorization is valid throughout the EU and is automatically recognized in three of the four European Free Trade Association states (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). This allows the marketing authorization holder to market the medicine and make it available throughout the EEA. The timeframe for the first step of the centralized procedure (evaluation by the CHMP) opinion is 210 days from receipt of a valid application. However, the actual time needed to complete this first step is generally longer than the 210 days, since procedural clock stops are required in order for the applicant to respond to additional requests for information by the CHMP. Following a positive CHMP opinion, the EC has 67 days to issue its decision to grant the marketing authorization or not. Accelerated evaluation of the MAA under the centralized procedure is possible in exceptional cases, following a justified request from the applicant, when a medicinal product is of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The CHMP determines what constitutes a major public interest on a case-by-case basis. Justifications must include the major benefits expected and present the arguments to support the claim that the medicinal product introduces new methods of therapy or improves on existing methods, thereby addressing, to a significant extent, the greater unmet needs for maintaining and improving public health. If the applicant provides sufficient justification for an accelerated assessment, the CHMP can reduce the timeframe for review of a MAA to 150 days. The timeframe for the EC to issue its decision remains unaltered. Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 defines in which cases the centralized application procedure must (mandatory scope) or may (optional scope) be followed. The centralized procedure is mandatory for medicinal products derived from biotechnological and other high-tech processes, orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy medicinal products and products indicated for the treatment of HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions, viral diseases and neurodegenerative diseases. For medicinal products that do not fall under any of the aforementioned categories, a submission via the centralized procedure is possible, provided that it concerns (i) a new active substance or (ii) product that can demonstrate a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation and for which approval would be in the interest of public health. Given the foregoing, our portfolio of innovative orphan products for neurodegenerative diseases is subject to the mandatory centralized procedure. Innovative medicinal products which have been authorized in accordance with the centralized procedure, benefit from an eight-year period of data protection/exclusivity and a ten-year period of marketing protection/exclusivity. During the data exclusivity period, applicants for approval of generics of these innovative products cannot reference or rely upon data contained in the marketing authorization dossier submitted for the innovative medicinal product. Furthermore, the marketing protection entails that even if the generic product is approved, it cannot be placed on the market until the full ten-year period of market protection has elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference medicinal product. The marketing protection period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder for the innovative product obtains an - 22 - authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Similar to the U.S., marketing authorization holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA and/or the national competent authorities of the EU Member States. This oversight applies both before and after the granting of manufacturing and marketing authorizations. It includes compliance with EU GMP and GDP rules in relation to such activities as distribution, importing and exporting of medicinal products, rules governing conduct of pharmacovigilance (including good pharmacovigilance practices (“GVP”)) and requirements governing advertising, promotion and sale of medicinal products. Failure to comply with the EU Member State laws implementing the EU Community Code on medicinal products, and EU rules governing the promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices, with the EU Member State laws that apply to the promotion of medicinal products, statutory health insurance, bribery and anti-corruption or with other applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the relevant EU Member State authorities. This may include any of the following sanctions: fines, imprisonment, orders forfeiting products or prohibiting or suspending their supply to the market, orders to suspend, vary, or withdraw the marketing authorization or requiring the manufacturer to issue public warnings, or to conduct a product recall. The approval process in other countries outside the U.S. and the EU varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for the FDA approval. In addition, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement for market access vary greatly from country to country. In all cases, clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. Data and Market Exclusivities In addition to patent exclusivities, the FDA and certain other foreign health authorities may grant data or market exclusivity for a newly approved chemical entity or biologic, which runs in parallel to any patent protection. Regulatory data protection or exclusivity prevents a potential generic competitor from relying on clinical trial data generated by the sponsor when establishing the safety and efficacy of its competing product. Market exclusivity prohibits any marketing of the same drug for the same indication. In the U.S., the FDA will generally grant an NCE that is the subject of an NDA with five years of regulatory data exclusivity, during which time a competitor generally may not submit an application to the FDA based on a sponsor’s clinical data. A competitor, however, may file an Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”) seeking approval of a generic drug four years from the date of approval of the innovative product if it is accompanied by a so-called Paragraph IV certification. For a newly approved biologic that is the subject of a BLA, the FDA will generally grant 12 years of market exclusivity, during which time a competitor may not market the same drug for the same indication. In addition, the FDA may provide six months of pediatric exclusivity to a sponsor of a marketing application if the sponsor conducted a pediatric study or studies of a product. This process is applied to products developed for adult use and is initiated by the FDA as a written request for pediatric studies that applies to a sponsor’s product. If the sponsor conducts qualifying studies and the studies are accepted by the FDA, then an additional six months of pediatric exclusivity will be added to previously granted exclusivity, such as orphan drug exclusivity and NCE exclusivity, as well as certain patent-based exclusivities. Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity In the U.S., the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that drug. An orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. An orphan drug designation does not shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. The approval of an orphan designation request does not alter the regulatory requirements and process for obtaining marketing approval. Safety and efficacy of a compound must be established through adequate and well-controlled studies. If a chemical or biological product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives FDA approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is generally entitled to an orphan drug exclusivity period of seven years, which means the FDA may not grant approval to any other application to market the same chemical or biological product for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as where an alternative product demonstrates clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. The FDA has historically taken the position that the scope of orphan exclusivity aligns with the approved indication or use of a product, rather than the disease or condition for which the product received orphan designation. However, on September 30, 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit issued a decision in Catalyst Pharms., Inc. v. Becerra holding that the scope of orphan drug exclusivity - 23 - must align with the disease or condition for which the product received orphan designation, even if the product’s approval was for a narrower use or indication. It remains to be seen how this decision affects orphan drug exclusivity going forward. In addition, holders of exclusivity for orphan drugs are expected to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of their orphan drugs to meet the needs of patients. Failure to do so could result in the withdrawal of orphan exclusivity for the drug. Competitors may receive approval of different drugs or biologics for the indications for which a prior approved orphan drug has exclusivity. Pharmaceutical companies can apply for the designation as an orphan medicine. In the EU, applications for orphan designation are evaluated by the EMA in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 141/2000. In order to qualify as an orphan medicine, the medicinal product must be intended to diagnose, prevent or treat a condition that is life-threatening or chronically debilitating, with a prevalence of no more than 5 in 10,000 people in the EU or for which it is unlikely that its sale would generate sufficient returns to justify the investment needed for its development. In addition, the sponsor is required to demonstrate that no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition has been authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the medicinal product is of significant benefit to those affected by the condition as compared to approved methods. The benefits of being granted orphan designation are significant, including up to ten years of market exclusivity. During this ten-year period, the EMA may not accept a new marketing application for a similar medicinal product for the same therapeutic indication as the approved orphan medicinal product. Pursuant to Regulation (EC) 1901/2006 on medicinal products for pediatric use, the ten-year orphan market exclusivity can be extended to a maximum period of twelve years upon the satisfactory completion of all the key elements of the agreed PIP. We have been granted orphan drug designation for eteplirsen in the EU. Expanded / Early Access In certain countries, drug products approved in the U.S. or the EU can be accessed by patients before the drug has obtained marketing approval in such country. There are various forms of this access including, but not limited to, the actual purchase of product by the purchaser, which is often times the government for patients, on a named patient basis, and providing the product free of charge on a named patient basis for compassionate use. Each country has its own laws and regulations that apply to these forms of access and the extent and nature of such laws and regulations vary by country. For example, in 2018, the so-called Right to Try Act became law in the U.S. The law, among other things, allows eligible patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to such eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act. We established a global EAP for eteplirsen, golodirsen and casimersen in some countries where eteplirsen, golodirsen and casimersen currently have not been approved. The EAP provides a mechanism through which physicians can prescribe our products, within their professional responsibility, to patients who meet pre-specified medical and other criteria and can secure funding. - 24 - Other Regulatory Requirements In addition to regulations enforced by the FDA and foreign authorities relating to the clinical development and marketing of products, we are or may become subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and potential future foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations. Our research and development processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals and produce waste products. We are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and waste products. Although we believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws that apply to us, we cannot predict whether new regulatory restrictions will be imposed by state or federal regulators and agencies or whether existing laws and regulations will adversely affect us in the future. While it is impossible to accurately predict the future costs associated with environmental compliance and potential remediation activities, we understand the importance of complying with all current and future applicable environmental laws and regulations. Compliance with environmental laws is not expected to require significant capital expenditures and has not had, and is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on our operations. Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws We are subject to various federal, state and local laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, including anti-kickback and false claims laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by crime or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, and/or exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). Federal and state authorities are paying increased attention to enforcement of these laws within the pharmaceutical industry, and private individuals have been active in alleging violations of the laws and bringing suits on behalf of the government under the federal False Claims Act (“FCA”). Violations of international fraud and abuse laws could result in similar penalties, including exclusion from participation in health programs outside the U.S. Given the broad scope of these laws, our activities could be subject to scrutiny under the laws. If we were subject to allegations concerning, or were convicted of violating, these laws, our business could be harmed. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute generally prohibits, among other things, a pharmaceutical manufacturer from directly or indirectly soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying any remuneration in cash or in kind where one purpose is either to induce the referral of an individual for, or the purchase or prescription of, a particular drug that is payable by a federal health care program, including Medicare or Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or a specific intent to violate the statute. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute can result in exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs as well as civil and criminal fines and penalties of up to $112,131 per violation and three times the amount of the unlawful remuneration. A claim arising from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute also constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. A new federal anti-kickback statute enacted in 2018 prohibits certain payments related to referrals of patients to certain providers (such as clinical laboratories) and applies to services reimbursed by private health plans as well as government health care programs. Federal and state false claims laws generally prohibit anyone from knowingly and willfully, among other activities, presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for drugs or services that are false or fraudulent (which may include claims for services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary services). False or fraudulent claims for purposes of the FCA carry fines and civil penalties for violations ranging from $12,537 to $25,076 for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages sustained by the federal government and may provide the basis for exclusion from federally funded healthcare programs. There is also a criminal FCA statute by which individuals or entities that submit false claims can face criminal penalties. In addition, under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law, the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) Office of Inspector General has the authority to exclude from participation in federal health care programs or to impose civil penalties against any person who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, certain false or otherwise improper claims. A federal healthcare fraud statute prohibits the knowing and willful execution, or attempt to execute, a scheme to defraud a health care benefit program, including private health plans, or obtain, through false or fraudulent pretenses, money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, such a health care benefit program. The majority of states also have anti-kickback, false claims, and similar fraud and abuse laws and although the specific provisions of these laws vary, their scope is generally broad, and there may not be regulations, guidance or court decisions that apply the laws to particular industry practices. Laws and regulations have also been enacted by the federal government and various states to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers. The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers; require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government; and/or require disclosure to the government and/or public of financial interactions (so-called “sunshine laws”). State laws may also require disclosure of pharmaceutical pricing information and marketing expenditures. Manufacturers must also submit information to the FDA on the identity and quantity of drug samples requested and distributed by a manufacturer during each year. Many of these laws and - 25 - regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our activities could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent federal and state laws and regulations. Data Privacy and Security We may be subject to privacy and security laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate, obtain or store personally identifiable information. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business. Our ongoing efforts to comply with evolving laws and regulations may be costly and require ongoing modifications to our policies, procedures and systems. Failure to comply with laws regarding data protection would expose us to risk of enforcement actions and penalties under such laws. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. Within the U.S., there are numerous federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of personal information. For example, at the federal level, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as amended, and its implementing regulations establish privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information, or protected health information, and require the implementation of administrative, physical and technological safeguards to protect the privacy of protected health information. While we have determined that we are neither a “covered entity” nor a “business associate” directly subject to HIPAA, many of the U.S. health care providers with which we interact are subject to HIPAA, and we may have assumed obligations related to protecting the privacy of personal information. States are increasingly regulating the privacy and security of personal information. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which as of January 1, 2023 and was amended and expanded by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), gives California consumers (defined to include all California residents) certain rights, including the right to ask covered companies to disclose copies of personal information collected and delete a consumer’s personal information and requires covered companies to provide notice to California consumers regarding their data processing activities. Together the CCPA and CPRA place limitations on a covered company’s ability to sell personal information and share it for purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising. The Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (“VCDPA”) has also gone into effect and other states either have comprehensive laws similar to the VCDPA, CCPA and CDPRA going into operation this year, in the case of Colorado, Connecticut and Utah, or are considering such laws. In addition, we may be subject to privacy and security laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate, obtain or store personally identifiable information. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business. For example, the processing of personal data relating to EEA citizens or in the context of the activities of an establishment in the EEA is subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), which took effect in May 2018. The GDPR increases obligations with respect to clinical trials conducted in the EEA, such as in relation to the provision of fair processing notices, responding to data subjects who exercise their rights and reporting certain data breaches to regulators and affected individuals. The GDPR also requires us to enter certain contractual arrangements with third parties that process GDPR-covered personal data on our behalf. The GDPR also increases the scrutiny applied to transfers of personal data from the EEA (including from clinical trial sites in the EEA) to countries that are considered by the EC to lack an adequate level of data protection, such as the U.S. The July 2020 invalidation by the Court of Justice of the EU of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework, one of the mechanisms used to legitimize the transfer of personal data from the EEA to the U.S., has led to increased scrutiny on data transfers from the EEA to the U.S. generally and may increase our costs of compliance with data privacy legislation. If our or our partners’ or service providers’ privacy or data security measures fail to comply with the GDPR requirements, we may be subject to litigation, regulatory investigations, enforcement notices requiring us to change the way we use personal data and/or fines of up to EURO 20 million or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, as well as claims by affected individuals, negative publicity, reputational harm and a potential loss of business and goodwill. Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement We have an ongoing dialogue with payors globally with the goal of obtaining broad coverage for our products. To date, payors’ policies on coverage for our products have varied widely, including policies that allow broad coverage per the respective product’s prescribing information, policies that provide limited coverage and policies that have denied coverage. The majority of payors have policies that provide for case-by-case coverage or restricted coverage. Our revenue depends, in part, upon the extent to which payors provide coverage for our products and the amount that payors, including government authorities or programs, private health insurers and other organizations, reimburse patients and healthcare providers for the cost of our products. Reimbursement coverage policies and inadequate reimbursement may reduce the demand for, or the price purchasers are willing to pay for, our or our partners’ products. Patients who are prescribed medications for the treatment of their conditions, and their prescribing physicians, generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Patients are unlikely - 26 - to use our products unless coverage is provided, and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of such products. Third Party Reimbursement and Pricing in the U.S. Commercial Insurance. Coverage and reimbursement of our products vary from commercial payor to commercial payor. Many commercial payors, such as managed care plans, manage access to FDA approved products, and may use drug formularies and medical policies (which may include specific coverage requirements such as prior authorization, re-authorization and achieving performance metrics under value-based contracts) to control utilization. Exclusion from or restriction in coverage can reduce product usage. Medicaid . Our products are eligible to be reimbursed by Medicaid. Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that is administered by the states for low income and disabled beneficiaries. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, participating manufacturers are required to pay a rebate for each unit of product reimbursed under the state Medicaid programs. The amount of the rebate for each product is set by law and depends in part on the prices at which our products are sold to certain other purchasers and may be subject to an additional discount if certain pricing increases more than inflation. State Medicaid programs and Medicaid managed care plans can seek additional “supplemental” rebates from manufacturers in connection with favorable positioning on formularies. Medicare . Medicare is a federal program that is administered by the federal government that covers individuals age 65 and over, disabled individuals and individuals with certain conditions. Our products are eligible for reimbursement under Medicare Part B. Medicare Part B generally covers drugs that are usually administered by physicians or other clinicians. Medicare Part B pays for such drugs under a payment methodology based on the average sales price (“ASP”) of the drugs. Reimbursement levels and reimbursement methodologies have come under scrutiny and may be subject to change. See “ Government Regulation – Healthcare and Other Reform. ” The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) are also increasingly bundling drug reimbursement into procedure costs, which can severely decrease the reimbursement rates for some manufacturers’ drugs. Federal Purchasers . Drug products are subject to discounted pricing when purchased by federal agencies via the Federal Supply Schedule (“FSS”). FSS participation is required for a drug product to be covered and reimbursed by certain federal agencies and for coverage under Medicaid, Medicare Part B and the Public Health Service (“PHS”) 340B drug pricing program. FSS pricing is negotiated periodically with the Department of Veterans Affairs. FSS pricing is intended not to exceed the price that a manufacturer charges its most-favored non-federal customer for its product. In addition, prices for drugs purchased by the Veterans Administration, Department of Defense (including drugs purchased by military personnel and dependents through the TRICARE retail pharmacy program), Coast Guard, and PHS are subject to a cap on pricing (known as the “federal ceiling price”) and may be subject to an additional discount if pricing increases more than the rate of inflation. PHS 340B Drug Pricing Program . To maintain coverage of drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and Medicare Part B, manufacturers are required to extend discounts to certain purchasers under the PHS 340B drug pricing program. Purchasers eligible for discounts include hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of financially needy patients, community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the PHS. Healthcare and Other Reform. In the U.S., federal and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reform delivery of, or payment for, health care, which include initiatives to reduce the cost of healthcare. For example, in March 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (the “Healthcare Reform Act”), which expanded health care coverage through Medicaid expansion, implemented the “individual mandate” for health insurance coverage (by imposing a tax penalty on individuals who did not obtain insurance) and changed the coverage and reimbursement of drug products under government healthcare programs. There have been ongoing efforts to modify or repeal all or certain provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act. For example, tax reform legislation was enacted at the end of 2017 that eliminated the tax penalty established under the Healthcare Reform Act for individuals who do not maintain mandated health insurance coverage beginning in 2019. The Healthcare Reform Act has also been subject to judicial challenge. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the latest judicial challenge to the Healthcare Reform Act brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the Healthcare Reform Act. Beyond the Healthcare Reform Act, there have been ongoing healthcare reform efforts. Some recent healthcare reform efforts have sought to address certain issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including an expansion of telehealth coverage under Medicare and accelerated or advanced Medicare payments to healthcare providers. Other reform efforts affect pricing or payment for drug products. Drug pricing and payment reform was a focus of the Trump Administration and has been a focus of the Biden Administration. For example, federal legislation enacted in 2021 eliminates a statutory cap on Medicaid drug rebate program rebates effective January 1, 2024. As another example, in 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (""IRA"") of 2022 contains numerous drug pricing and payment reforms. Among other provisions, the IRA imposes a yearly cap ($2,000 in 2025) on out-of-pocket prescription drug costs in Medicare Part D, implements a new Medicare Part D manufacturer discount drug program in 2025; requires manufacturers to - 27 - pay a rebate to the federal government if prices for single-source drugs and biologicals covered under Medicare Part B and nearly all covered drugs under Medicare Part D increase faster than the rate of inflation and, starting in 2026, creates a drug price negotiation program under which the prices for certain high Medicare spend drugs and biologicals without generic or biosimilar competition will be limited by a cap that is defined by reference to, among other things, a specified non-federal average manufacturer price. Healthcare reform efforts have been and may continue to be subject to scrutiny and legal challenge. For example, revisions to regulations under the federal anti-kickback statute would remove protection for traditional Medicare Part D discounts offered by pharmaceutical manufacturers to pharmacy benefit managers and health plans. Pursuant to court order, the removal was delayed and recent legislation imposed a moratorium on implementation of the rule until January 1, 2032. Adoption of new healthcare reform legislation at the federal or state level could affect demand for, or pricing of, our products or product candidates if approved for sale. We cannot predict, however, the ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or action, or its impact on us, and healthcare reform could increase compliance costs and may adversely affect our future business and financial results. There have also been efforts by government officials or legislators to implement measures to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products, including legislation on drug importation. Recently, there has been considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing and proposals to address the perceived high cost of pharmaceuticals. There have also been recent state legislative efforts to address drug costs, which generally have focused on increasing transparency around drug costs or limiting drug prices. Certain state legislation has been subject to legal challenges. Adoption of new legislation regulating drug pricing at the federal or state level could further affect demand for, or pricing of, our products. General legislative cost control measures may also affect reimbursement for our products. The Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended, resulted in the imposition of reductions in Medicare (but not Medicaid) payments to providers in 2013 and remains in effect through 2031 (except May 1, 2020 to March 31, 2022) unless additional Congressional action is taken. Any significant spending reductions affecting Medicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented and/or any significant taxes or fees that may be imposed on us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Third Party Reimbursement and Pricing outside the U.S. We currently have no products approved for marketing outside the U.S., other than a marketing authorization for EXONDYS 51 in Israel. We may need to conduct long-term pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. In the EU and certain other territories, price controls and Health Technology Assessments for new, highly priced medicines are expected. Uncertainty exists about the pricing and reimbursement status of newly approved products in the EU. Criteria such as cost-effectiveness, cost per quality-adjusted life year, budget impact, or others, in addition to the clinical benefit, are often required to demonstrate added value or benefit of a drug and vary by country. Third party reimbursement limits may reduce the demand for our products. The pace of the application process in some countries could also delay commercial product launches. Gaining acceptance of our product pipeline and an economically viable reimbursement terms in the EU and other markets will require strong education and awareness efforts around Duchenne as well as strong data supporting its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. - 28 - Competition The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive, and any product or product candidate developed by us competes or would likely compete with existing drugs and therapies. There are many pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, public and private universities, government agencies and research organizations that compete with us in developing various approaches to the treatment of rare, neuromuscular and other diseases. Many of these organizations have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing and sales and marketing resources than we have. Several of them have developed or are developing therapies that could be used for treatment of the same diseases that we are targeting. In addition, some of these competitors have significantly greater commercial infrastructures than we have. Our ability to compete successfully depends largely on: EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53 and AMONDYS 45 were the first three disease modifying therapeutics approved by the FDA for the treatment of Duchenne for patients with a confirmed mutation that is amenable to exon 51 skipping, exon 53 skipping or exon 45 skipping, respectively. However, in the field of Duchenne alone, these products and those in our pipeline face a variety of competitors who either have FDA approval or are being clinically developed for the treatment of Duchenne. For example, Nippon Shinyaku Co. Ltd. (“Nippon”) announced on August 13, 2020 that the FDA approved VILTEPSO (viltolarsen) injection for patients with Duchenne who are amenable to exon 53 skipping therapy. On March 25, 2020, Nippon announced that the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare (“MHLW”) approved Viltepso Intravenous Infusion 250 mg (viltolarsen) for the treatment of patients with Duchenne who are amendable to exon 53 skipping therapy making it the first non-steroidal treatment for Duchenne approved in Japan. Nippon has announced plans to pursue global registration for viltolarsen. In addition, there are many companies who have announced plans to transition pre-clinical candidates to clinical development for the treatment of Duchenne, including the following: There are several companies in addition to those mentioned above that are pursuing disease modifying programs for Duchenne that are at the pre-clinical stage or clinical stage. These companies are pursuing oligonucleotides, gene transfer therapy or gene editing. Other companies continue to pursue development and approval of products for the treatment of Duchenne and their products may or may not prove to be safer and/or more efficacious than the products and product candidates in our Duchenne pipeline. Regarding any of these competitors, it is unknown if clinical development of these or other compounds is planned or would be continued. Additionally, companies have product candidates with mechanisms of action distinct from ours in different stages of development or approval in Duchenne which we believe could be seen as complementary to exon skipping and not a direct replacement of our products or product candidates at this time. - 29 - Several companies and institutions have also entered into collaborations or other agreements for the development of product candidates, including mRNA, gene (CRISPR, AAV, etc.) or small molecule therapies that are potential competitors to therapies being developed by us in the muscular dystrophy, neuromuscular, CNS and rare disease space. We also believe that other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies share a focus on RNA-targeted drug discovery and development. For additional information on the various risks posed by competition, refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Human Capital Resources Our urgent mission – to engineer precision genetic medicine for rare diseases that devastate lives and cut futures short – is dependent on our ability to attract, develop and retain the industry’s best and brightest talent across all dimensions of diversity. This understanding informs our approach to managing our human capital resources. General Information. As of December 31, 2022, we had 1,162 employees globally, 562 of whom hold advanced degrees. Of these employees, 779 are engaged directly in research and development activities and 383 are in selling and general and administration. None of our employees in the U.S. are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we consider relations with our employees to be good. Equity, diversity, and inclusion . We promote diversity, inclusion and equity across the organization. In the area of gender diversity, representation of women has increased over the past several years: in 2019 and 2020 women made up 54% and 55% of our workforce, respectively, and in 2021, this percentage increased to 56%. As of December 31, 2022, women made up 57% of our workforce. The number of women in leadership positions has also consistently increased. In 2017, women represented 35% of the leadership positions at the Director level and above. This percentage increased to 36% in 2018, 44% in 2019, 47% in 2020, 48% in 2021 and 52% as of December 31, 2022. In addition, as of December 31, 2022, women held 25% of the seats of our Board of Directors, including the Chair of the Board. Racial and ethnic diversity has also increased in the past few years, from 23% of our workforce being racially/ethnically diverse in 2017 and 2018, increasing to 26% in 2019 and to 30% in 2020 and 2021. As of December 31, 2022, this number increased to 34%. As of December 31, 2022, 63% of our Executive Committee, which represents the most senior leadership positions in the Company, is diverse based on gender and ethnicity. Compensation, Benefits and Ongoing Professional Development. We face intense competition for qualified and specialized employees from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities and government entities, and we are committed to rewarding, supporting, and developing our employees who make it possible to deliver on our strategy. To that end, we offer a comprehensive total rewards package that includes market-competitive pay, broad-based equity grants and bonuses, healthcare benefits, retirement savings plans, paid time off and family leave, caregiving support, fitness subsidies, and an Employee Assistance Program. We also offer robust learning opportunities for employees at every stage in their career and provide annual training to employees on various topics. In recognition of the ongoing challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken various steps to support our employees, including transitioning to remote/hybrid work and offering flexible schedules, childcare assistance and sessions focused on resilience and happiness in uncertain times. At the same time, we continue to take steps to protect our facility-dependent employees to ensure they remain healthy and feel supported and safe in our facilities. General Corporate Information We were originally incorporated in the State of Oregon on July 22, 1980, and on June 6, 2013, we reincorporated in the State of Delaware. Our principal executive offices are located at 215 First Street, Suite 415, Cambridge, MA 02142 and our telephone number is (617) 274-4000. Our common stock is quoted on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “SRPT”. While we achieve revenue from our products in the U.S. and through distribution of eteplirsen, golodirsen and casimersen through our EAP outside the U.S., we are likely to continue to incur operating losses in the near term associated with our ongoing operations, research and development activities and potential business development activities. For more information about our revenues and operating losses, see Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . - 30 - As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $2,008.4 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments, consisting of $966.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, $1,022.6 million of short-term investments and $19.0 million of long-term restricted cash. We believe that our balance of cash, cash equivalents and investments is sufficient to fund our current operational plan for at least the next twelve months. In addition to pursuing additional cash resources through public or private financings, we may also seek to enter into contracts, including collaborations or licensing agreements with respect to our technologies, with third parties, including government entities.

Set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC are descriptions of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report. Because of the following factors, as well as other variables affecting our operating results, past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also affect our results of operations and financial condition. Risks Related to Our Business We are highly dependent on the commercial success of our products in the U.S. We may not be able to meet expectations with respect to sales of our products or attain profitability and positive cash-flow from operations. The FDA granted accelerated approval for EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53 and AMONDYS 45, respectively, as therapeutic treatments for Duchenne in patients who have a confirmed mutation in the dystrophin gene that is amenable to exon 51, exon 53 and exon 45 skipping, respectively. EXONDYS 51 is currently commercially available in the U.S. and Israel only, and VYONDYS 53 and AMONDYS 45 are currently commercially available in the U.S. only, although they are available in additional countries through our EAP. The commercial success of our products continues to depend on a number of factors attributable to one of our products or the products of our competitors, including, but not limited to: - 32 - In addition, the response to COVID-19 by healthcare providers has made it difficult for some patients to receive infusions or initiate treatment with our commercial products. The need to prioritize rated orders issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency pursuant to the U.S. Defense Production Act could also impact the manufacturing, supply chain and distribution of our products and product candidates. For this and other reasons, such as delays in processing reauthorizations and modifications to program benefits by insurers, we expect that COVID-19 will reduce our revenue from commercial product sales. We experience significant fluctuations in sales of our products from period to period and, ultimately, we may never generate sufficient revenues from our products to reach or maintain profitability or sustain our anticipated levels of operations. Even though EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53 and AMONDYS 45 have received accelerated approval from the FDA, they face future post-approval development and regulatory requirements, which present additional challenges for us to successfully navigate. The accelerated approvals for EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53 and AMONDYS 45 granted by the FDA were based on an increase in the surrogate biomarker of dystrophin in skeletal muscles observed in some patients treated with these products. These products are subject to ongoing FDA requirements governing labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping, and we are required to submit additional safety, efficacy and other post-marketing information to the FDA. Under the accelerated approval pathway, continued approval may be contingent upon verification of a clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. These post-approval requirements and commitments may not be feasible and/or could impose significant burdens and costs on us; could negatively impact our development, manufacturing and supply of our products; and could negatively impact our financial results. Failure to meet post-approval commitments and requirements, including completion of enrollment and in particular, any failure to obtain positive safety and efficacy data from our ongoing and planned studies of our products, would lead to negative regulatory action from the FDA and/or withdrawal of regulatory approval of EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53 or AMONDYS 45. The recently enacted FDORA has expanded FDA's expedited withdrawal procedures for drugs approved via the accelerated approval pathway if a sponsor fails to conduct any required post-approval study with due diligence. Manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP regulations. Drug product manufacturers are required to continuously monitor and report adverse events from clinical trials and commercial use of the product. If we or a regulatory agency discover previously unknown adverse events or events of unanticipated severity or frequency, a regulatory agency may require labeling changes, implementation of risk evaluation and mitigation strategy program, or additional post-marketing studies or clinical trials. If we or a regulatory agency discover previously unknown problems with a product, such as problems with a facility where the API or drug product is manufactured or tested, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product and/or the manufacturer, including removal of specific product lots from the market, withdrawal of the product from the market, suspension of manufacturing or suspension of clinical trials using the same manufacturing materials. Sponsors of drugs approved under FDA accelerated approval provisions also are required to submit to the FDA, at least 30 days before initial use, all promotional materials intended for use after the first 120 days following marketing approval. If we or the manufacturing facilities for our products fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may: - 33 - We are subject to uncertainty relating to reimbursement policies which, if not favorable, could hinder or prevent the commercial success of our products and/or product candidates. Our ability to successfully maintain and/or increase sales of our products in the U.S. depends in part on the coverage and reimbursement levels set by governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors. Third party payors are increasingly challenging the effectiveness of and prices charged for medical products and services. We may not be able to obtain or maintain adequate third-party coverage or reimbursement for our products, and/or we may be required to provide discounts or rebates on our products in order to obtain or maintain adequate coverage. We expect that private insurers will continue to consider the efficacy, effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and safety of our products, including any new data and analyses that we are able to collect and make available in a compliant manner, in determining whether to approve reimbursement for our products and at what levels. If there are considerable delays in the generation of new evidence or if any new data and information we collect is not favorable, third party insurers may make coverage decisions that negatively impact sales of our products. We continue to have discussions with payors, some of which may eventually deny coverage. We may not receive approval for reimbursement of our products from additional insurers on a satisfactory rate or basis, in which case our business would be materially adversely affected. In addition, obtaining these approvals can be a time consuming and expensive process. Our business would be materially adversely affected if we are not able to maintain favorable coverage decisions and/or fail to receive additional favorable coverage decisions from third party insurers, in particular during re-authorization processes for patients that have already initiated therapy. Our business could also be adversely affected if government health programs, private health insurers, including managed care organizations, or other reimbursement bodies or payors limit the indications for which our products will be reimbursed or fail to recognize accelerated approval and surrogate endpoints as clinically meaningful. In addition, the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in delays in processing reauthorizations and modifications to program benefits by insurers, making it difficult for patients to obtain or maintain favorable coverage decisions for our products. Furthermore, we cannot predict to what extent the COVID-19 pandemic, depending on its duration, an economic recession, changes in fiscal policy or general increase in unemployment rates may disrupt global healthcare systems and access to our products or result in a widespread loss of individual health insurance coverage due to unemployment or trends in employee attrition, a shift from commercial payor coverage to government payor coverage, or an increase in demand for patient assistance and/or free drug programs, any of which would adversely affect access to our products and our net sales. In some foreign countries, particularly Canada and the countries of Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to strict governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take 12 to 24 months or longer after the receipt of regulatory approval and product launch. In order to obtain favorable reimbursement for the indications sought or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to collect additional data, including conducting additional studies. Furthermore, several countries around the world have implemented government measures to either freeze or reduce pricing of pharmaceutical products. If reimbursement for our products is unavailable in any country in which reimbursement is sought, limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be materially harmed. In addition, many foreign countries reference to other countries’ official public list price, hence an unsatisfactory price level in one country could consequently impinge negatively upon overall revenue. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of our current and future products due to a number of factors, including current and future healthcare reforms and initiatives by government health programs and private insurers (including managed care plans) to reduce healthcare costs, the scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing, the ongoing debates on reducing government spending and additional legislative proposals. These healthcare reform efforts or any future legislation or regulatory actions aimed at controlling and reducing healthcare costs, including through measures designed to limit reimbursement, restrict access or impose unfavorable pricing modifications on pharmaceutical products, could impact our and our partners’ ability to obtain or maintain reimbursement for our products at satisfactory levels, or at all, which could materially harm our business and financial results. Additionally, our gene therapy product candidates represent novel approaches to treatment that will call for new levels of innovation in both pricing, reimbursement, payment and drug access strategies. Current reimbursement models may not accommodate the unique factors of our gene therapy product candidates, including high up-front costs, lack of long-term efficacy and safety data and - 34 - fees associated with complex administration, dosing and patient monitoring requirements. Hence, it may be necessary to restructure approaches to payment, pricing strategies and traditional payment models to support these therapies. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. If we are unable to obtain adequate levels of reimbursement, our ability to successfully market and sell our products and product candidates will be harmed. The manner and level at which reimbursement is provided for services related to our products and product candidates (e.g., for administration of our products to patients) is also important. Inadequate reimbursement for such services may lead to physician resistance and limit our ability to market or sell our products. Healthcare policy reform and other governmental and private payor initiatives may have an adverse effect upon, and could prevent commercial success of our products and product candidates. The U.S. government and individual states continue to aggressively pursue healthcare reform, which includes ongoing attempts to manage utilization as well as control and/or lower the cost of prescription drugs and biologics. See “ Item 1. Business—Government Regulation—Third Party Reimbursement and Pricing in the U.S. ” There is no assurance that federal or state health care reform will not adversely affect our future business and financial results, and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative, judicial or administrative changes relating to healthcare policy will affect our business. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including proposed or implemented reforms involving price controls, waivers from Medicaid drug rebate law requirements, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs and the introduction of international reference pricing in the U.S. We anticipate that the U.S. Congress, state legislatures and the private sector will continue to consider and may adopt healthcare policies intended to curb rising healthcare costs. These cost containment measures may include, among other possible actions, implementation or modification of: In recent years, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their commercial products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted state and federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. We are unable to predict what additional legislation, regulations or policies, if any, relating to the healthcare industry or third party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future or what effect such legislation, regulations or policies would have on our business. Any cost containment measures, including those listed above, or other healthcare system reforms that are adopted, could significantly decrease the available coverage and the price we might establish for our products and product candidates, which would have an adverse effect on our net revenues and operating results. - 35 - Our products may not be widely adopted by patients, payors or healthcare providers, which would adversely impact our potential profitability and future business prospects. The commercial success of our products, particularly in the U.S., depends upon the level of market adoption by patients, payors and healthcare providers. If our products do not achieve an adequate level of market adoption for any reason, or if market adoption does not persist, our potential profitability and our future business prospects will be severely adversely impacted. The degree of market acceptance of our products depends on a number of factors, including: Further, the potential commercial success of our product candidates, including SRP-9001, will depend on additional factors, including the capacity of any infusion centers responsible for the administration of our product candidates. We may not be able to expand the global footprint of our products outside of the U.S. Even though EXONDYS 51 was approved for marketing in the U.S. and in Israel, and VYONDYS 53 and AMONDYS 45 were approved for marketing in the U.S., we may not receive approval to commercialize these products in additional countries. In November 2016, we submitted a MAA for eteplirsen to the EMA and the application was validated in December 2016. As we announced on June 1, 2018, the CHMP of the EMA adopted a negative opinion for eteplirsen. In September 2018, the CHMP of the EMA confirmed its negative opinion for eteplirsen, and the European Commission adopted the CHMP opinion in December 2018. During 2019, we sought follow-up EMA scientific advice for eteplirsen. Once data from our ongoing studies are available, we plan to evaluate future engagement with the EMA on potential next steps. In order to market any product in a country outside of the U.S., we must comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements for approval in those countries regarding demonstration of evidence of the product’s safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, labeling, distribution, advertising, and promotion, as well as pricing and reimbursement of the product. Obtaining marketing approval in a country outside of the U.S. is an extensive, lengthy, expensive and uncertain process, and the regulatory authority may reject an application or delay, limit or deny approval of any of our products for many reasons, including: - 36 - Approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ significantly from that required to obtain approval in the U.S. In particular, in many foreign countries, it is required that a product receives pricing and reimbursement approval before the product can be distributed commercially. Many foreign countries undertake cost-containment measures that could affect pricing or reimbursement of our products. This can result in substantial delays, and the price that is ultimately approved in some countries may be lower than the price for which we expect to offer our products. Marketing approval in one country does not ensure marketing approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining marketing approval in one country may have a negative effect on the approval process in others. Failure to obtain marketing approval in other countries or any delay or setback in obtaining such approval would impair our ability to develop foreign markets for our products and could adversely affect our business and financial condition. In addition, failure to obtain approval in one country or area may affect sales under the EAP in other countries or areas. Even if we are successful in obtaining regulatory approval of our products in additional countries, our revenue earning capacity will depend on commercial and medical infrastructure, pricing and reimbursement negotiations and decisions with third party payors, including government payors. In addition, we have granted Roche an exclusive option to obtain an exclusive license to commercialize certain products, including eteplirsen, golodirsen and casimersen, outside of the U.S. If this option is exercised, Roche will have sole control over and decision-making authority with respect to the commercialization of such products outside the U.S. Historical revenues from eteplirsen, golodirsen and casimersen through our EAP outside the U.S. may not continue and we may not be able to continue to distribute eteplirsen, golodirsen and casimersen through our EAP. We established a global EAP for eteplirsen, golodirsen and casimersen in some countries where these products currently have not been approved. While we generate revenue from the distribution of these products through our EAP, we cannot predict whether historical revenues from this program will continue, whether we will be able to continue to distribute our products through our EAP, or whether revenues will exceed revenues historically generated from sales through our EAP. Reimbursement through national EAPs may cease to be available if authorization for an EAP expires or is terminated. For example, healthcare providers in EAP jurisdictions may not be convinced that their patients benefit sufficiently from our products or alternatively, may prefer to wait until such time as our products are approved by a regulatory authority in their country before prescribing any of our products. Even if a healthcare provider is interested in obtaining access to our products for its patient through the EAP, the patient may not be able to obtain access to our products if funding for the drug is not secured. Our business and financial results have not yet been adversely affected by the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. As our revenue from countries outside of the United States increases, our access to patients in that region through our EAP and our ability to generate revenue from commercial sales of our products in Russia or Ukraine may be adversely affected. The United States and other nations have raised the possibility of sanctions on companies that do business with Russia or its allies, including Belarus. We also may be adversely impacted by sanctions imposed on third parties with which we do business, such as third-party distributors and service providers of our EAP. Any failure to maintain revenues from sales of eteplirsen, golodirsen or casimersen through our EAP and/or to generate revenues from commercial sales of these products exceeding historical sales due to issues under our EAP or due to global instability, like that resulting from the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. - 37 - Failure to obtain or maintain regulatory exclusivity for our products could result in our inability to protect our products from competition and our business may be adversely impacted. If a competitor obtains an authorization to market the same or substantially same product before a product of ours is authorized in a given country and is granted regulatory exclusivity, then our product may not be authorized for sale as a result of the competitor’s regulatory exclusivity and as a result, our investment in the development of that product may not be returned. In addition to any patent protection, we rely on various forms of regulatory exclusivity to protect our products. During the development of our products, we anticipate any one form of regulatory exclusivities becoming available upon approval of our products. Implementation and enforcement of regulatory exclusivity, which may consist of regulatory data protection and market protection, varies widely from country to country. Failure to qualify for regulatory exclusivity, or failure to obtain or maintain the extent or duration of such protections that we expect in each of the markets for our products due to challenges, changes or interpretations in the law or otherwise, could affect our revenues for our products or our decision on whether to market our products in a particular country or countries or could otherwise have an adverse impact on our results of operations. We are not guaranteed to receive or maintain regulatory exclusivity for our current or future products, and if our products that are granted orphan status were to lose their status as orphan drugs or the data or marketing exclusivity provided for orphan drugs, our business and operations could be adversely affected. Due to the nature of our products and product candidate pipeline, in addition to NCE exclusivity and new biologic exclusivity, orphan drug exclusivity is especially important for our products that are eligible for orphan drug designation. For eligible products, we plan to rely on orphan drug exclusivity to maintain a competitive position. If we do not have adequate patent protection for our products, then the relative importance of obtaining regulatory exclusivity is even greater. While orphan status for any of our products, if granted or maintained, would provide market exclusivity for the time periods specified above upon approval, we would not be able to exclude other companies from obtaining regulatory approval of products using the same or similar active ingredient for the same indication during or beyond the exclusivity period applicable to our product on the basis of orphan drug status (e.g., seven years in the U.S.). For example, the exclusivity period for EXONDYS 51 will end in September 2023. Orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug, nor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process. A recent decision in 2021 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in Catalyst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. vs. Becerra regarding interpretation of the Orphan Drug Act’s exclusivity provisions as applied to drugs and biologics approved for orphan indications narrower than the product’s orphan designation has the potential to significantly broaden the scope of orphan exclusivity for such products. Depending on how FDA applies the Catalyst decision, it could impact our ability to obtain or seek to work around orphan exclusivity and might affect our ability to retain orphan exclusivity that the FDA previously has recognized for our products. Legislation has been introduced to amend the Orphan Drug Act in a way that may prevent these effects of the Catalyst decision, but it is unclear if or when such legislation could be enacted. In addition, we may face risks with maintaining regulatory exclusivities for our products, and our protection may be circumvented, even if maintained. For instance, orphan drug exclusivity in the U.S. may be rescinded if (i) an alternative, competing product demonstrates clinical superiority to our product with orphan exclusivity; or (ii) we are unable to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of our orphan products to meet the needs of patients. Moreover, competitors may receive approval of different drugs or biologics for indications for which our prior approved orphan products have exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity in Europe may be modified for several reasons, including a significant change to the orphan medicinal product designations or status criteria after-market authorization of the orphan product ( e.g. , product profitability exceeds the criteria for orphan drug designation), problems with the production or supply of the orphan drug, or a competitor drug, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior than the initial orphan drug. Thus, other companies may have received, or could receive, approval to market a product candidate that is granted orphan drug exclusivity for the same drug or similar drug and same orphan indication as any of our product candidates for which we plan to file an NDA, BLA or MAA. If that were to happen, our prior approved orphan products may face competition and any pending NDA, BLA or MAA for our product candidate for that indication may not be approved until the competing company’s period of exclusivity has expired in the U.S. or the EU, as applicable. For example, in September 2021, the FDA issued guidance concerning its position on interpreting when gene therapy products would be considered the “same” or “different” for purposes of orphan drug exclusivity. The guidance states that if two gene therapy products have or use different vectors, the FDA generally intends to consider them to be “different” drugs. Further, according to the guidance, the FDA generally intends to consider vectors from the same viral group (e.g., adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2) vs. adeno-associated virus 5 (AAV5)) to be different, when the differences between the vectors impact factors such as tropism, immune response avoidance, or potential insertional mutagenesis. However, there is considerable uncertainty as to the interpretation of these guidelines. As illustrated by this guidance, orphan drug exclusivity as applied to gene therapy products is an evolving area subject to change and interpretation by the FDA and therefore, we cannot be certain as to how the FDA will apply those rules to our products. - 38 - If we are unable to successfully maintain and further develop internal commercialization capabilities, sales of our products may be negatively impacted. We have hired and trained a commercial team and put in the organizational infrastructure we believe we need to support the commercial success of our products in the U.S. Factors that may inhibit our efforts to maintain and further develop commercial capabilities include: If we are not successful in maintaining an effective commercial, sales and marketing infrastructure, we will encounter difficulty in achieving, maintaining or increasing projected sales of our products in the U.S., which would adversely affect our business and financial condition. The patient population suffering from Duchenne, LGMDs, and CMT 1A is small and has not been established with precision. If the actual number of patients is smaller than we estimate, our revenue and ability to achieve profitability may be adversely affected. Duchenne, LGMD, and CMT 1A are rare, fatal genetic disorders. Duchenne affects an estimated one in approximately every 3,500 to 5,000 males born worldwide, of which up to 13% are estimated to be amenable to exon 51 skipping, up to 8% are estimated to be amenable to exon 53 skipping and up to 8% are estimated to be amenable to exon 45 skipping. LGMDs as a class affect an estimated range of approximately one in every 14,500 to one in every 123,000 individuals. CMT is a group of peripheral nerve disorders affecting approximately one in every 2,500 individuals. CMT type 1A affects approximately 50,000 patients in the U.S. Our estimates of the size of these patient populations are based on limited number of published studies as well as internal analyses. Various factors may decrease the market size of our products and product candidates, including the severity of the disease, patient demographics and the response of patients’ immune systems to our products and product candidates. If the results of these studies or our analysis of them do not accurately reflect the relevant patient population, our assessment of the market may be inaccurate, making it difficult or impossible for us to meet our revenue goals, or to obtain and maintain profitability. We face intense competition and rapid technological change, which may result in other companies discovering, developing or commercializing competitive products. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and subject to significant and rapid technological change. We are aware of many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are actively engaged in research and development in areas in which our products and product candidates are aimed. Some of these competitors are developing or testing product candidates that now, or may in the future, compete directly with our products or product candidates. For example, we face competition in the field of Duchenne by third parties who are developing or who had once developed: (i) exon skipping product candidates, such as Wave (notably for exons 51 and 53), Nippon Shinyaku (notably for exon 44 and exon 53, for which it has received FDA approval for its product Viltepso (viltolarsen)), Daiichi (notably for exon 45), Dyne Therapeutics pursuing antibody-oligonucleotide conjugates for exons 44, 45, 51, and 53, Avidity Biosciences pursuing antibody-oligonucleotide conjugates for exons 44, 45 and 51, PepGen (notably for exon 51) and BioMarin (BMN-351 for exon 51); (ii) gene therapies, such as Pfizer and Solid (in partnership with Ultragenyx), and Regenxbio; (iii) gene editing, including CRISPR/Cas 9 approaches, such as Exonics Therapeutics (acquired by Vertex Pharmaceuticals), CRISPR Therapeutics, Editas Medicine, Beam Therapeutics Inc. (in partnership with Pfizer) and Precision Biosciences (in partnership with Eli Lilly); (iv) other disease modifying approaches, such as PTC Therapeutics, which has a small molecule candidate, ataluren, that targets nonsense mutations; and (v) other approaches that may be palliative in nature or potentially complementary with our products and product candidates and that are or were once being developed by Santhera, Catabasis, Fibrogen, ReveraGen, Capricor Therapeutics (in partnership with Nippon Shinyaku), BioPhytis, Mallinckrodt, Antisense Therapeutics, Italfarmco, Dystrogen and Edgewise Therapeutics. Although BioMarin announced on May 31, 2016 its intent to discontinue clinical and regulatory development of drisapersen as well as its other clinical stage candidates, BMN 044, BMN 045 and BMN 053, then-currently in Phase 2 studies for distinct forms of Duchenne, it further announced its intent to continue to explore the development of next generation oligonucleotides for the treatment of Duchenne. Indeed, BioMarin has announced it is pursuing IND enabling studies for BMN-351, an oligonucleotide therapy. In addition, while Wave announced its intention to discontinue development of suvodirsen - 39 - and suspend development of WVE-N531, it has announced that it commenced clinical development for its exon 53 oligonucleotide, WVE-N531. In addition, we are aware of many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are actively engaged in research and development using platform technologies that may be viewed as competing with ours beyond and including those companies mentioned immediately above, such as Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Arbutus (formerly Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corp.), Deciphera Pharmaceuticals, Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Roche Innovation Center Copenhagen (formerly Santaris Pharma A/S), Shire plc (now Takeda), Biogen, Moderna Therapeutics, Avidity, Dyne Therapeutics, Stoke Therapeutics, Fulcrum Therapeutics, Ultragenyx, Sanofi and PepGen. Additionally, several companies and institutions have entered into collaborations or other agreements for the development of product candidates, including mRNA, gene therapy and gene editing (CRIPSR and AAV, among others) and small molecule therapies that are potential competitors for therapies being developed in the muscular dystrophy, neuromuscular and rare disease space, including, but not limited to, Astellas Pharma, Biogen Inc., Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Ionis, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Sanofi, Shire (now Takeda), Eli Lilly, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Moderna Therapeutics, Inc., Akashi, Capricor Therapeutics (in partnership with Nippon Shinyaku), Oxford University, Exonics Therapeutics (acquired by Vertex Pharmaceuticals), and Editas Medicine. If any of our competitors are successful in obtaining regulatory approval for any of their product candidates, it may limit our ability to enter into the market, gain market share or maintain market share in the Duchenne space or other diseases targeted by our platform technologies, products and product candidate pipeline. It is possible that our competitors will succeed in developing technologies that, in addition to limiting the market size for our products or product candidates, impact the regulatory approval and post-marketing process for our products and product candidates, are more effective than our products or product candidates or would render our technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. Our competitors may, among other things, relative to our products or product candidates: Further, development and commercialization of our gene therapy product candidates, such as SRP-9001, may compete with or supersede our current approved products, which may impact future revenues from sales of our current approved products. Our gene therapy product candidates are being developed for potential treatment of overlapping patient populations with our current approved products, and we have not determined if our gene therapy product candidates will be used in patients in combination with our existing approved products or in separate treatment regiments. Our revenue could face competitive pressures for any of the above reasons. Moreover, if competing products are marketed in a territory in which we also have the authority to market our products, our sales may diminish, or our business could be otherwise materially adversely affected. We have entered into multiple collaborations and strategic transactions, including our collaboration with Roche, and may seek or engage in future strategic collaborations, alliances, acquisitions or licensing agreements or other relationships that complement or expand our business. We may not be able to complete such transactions, and such transactions, if executed, may increase our capital requirements, dilute our stockholders, cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities and subject us to other risks. In order to achieve our long-term business objectives, we actively evaluate various strategic opportunities on an ongoing basis, including licensing or acquiring products, technologies or businesses. We may face competition from other companies in - 40 - pursuing such opportunities. This competition is most intense for approved drugs and late-stage drug candidates, which have the lowest risk in terms of probability of success but would have a higher risk and more immediate effect on our financial performance. Our ability to complete transactions may also be limited by applicable antitrust and trade regulation laws and regulations in the relevant U.S. and foreign jurisdictions in which we or the operations or assets we seek to acquire carry on business. We have entered into multiple collaborations, including with Roche, Nationwide, Duke University, Genethon, University of Florida, Genevant Sciences, Dyno Therapeutics, Selecta Biosciences, and Hansa Biopharma. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of such collaborations, and the anticipated benefits of any future collaborations or strategic relationships, each of which involves numerous risks, including: For example, we will have limited influence and control over the development and commercialization activities of Roche in the territories in which it leads development and commercialization of SRP-9001, and if the exclusive option is exercised, in the territories in which it may lead commercialization of certain other products or product candidates. Roche’s development and commercialization activities in the territories where it is the lead party may adversely impact our own efforts in the U.S. Failure by - 41 - Roche to meet its obligations under the collaboration agreement, to apply sufficient efforts at developing and commercializing collaboration products, or to comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements, may materially adversely affect our business and our results of operations. In addition, to the extent we rely on Roche to commercialize any products for which we obtain regulatory approval, we will receive less revenues than if we commercialized these products ourselves. Even if we achieve the long-term benefits associated with strategic transactions, our expenses and short-term costs may increase materially and adversely affect our liquidity and short-term net income (loss). Future licenses or acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, the creation of contingent liabilities, impairment or expenses related to goodwill, and impairment or amortization expenses related to other intangible assets, which could harm our financial condition. For example, in February 2020, we issued and sold 2,522,227 shares of common stock to Roche Finance in connection with the entry into the collaboration agreement with Roche. Risks Related to the Development of our Product Candidates We may find it difficult to enroll patients in our clinical trials, which could delay or prevent clinical trials of our product candidates. Identifying and qualifying patients to participate in clinical trials of our product candidates is critical to our success. The timing of our clinical trials depends on the speed at which we can recruit eligible patients to participate in testing our product candidates. We have experienced delays in some of our clinical trials, and we may experience similar delays in the future. These delays could result in increased costs, delays in advancing our product development, delays in testing the effectiveness of our technology or termination of the clinical trials altogether. We may not be able to identify, recruit and enroll a sufficient number of patients, or those with required or desired characteristics to achieve diversity in a study, to complete our clinical trials within the expected timeframe. Patient enrollment can be impacted by factors including, but not limited to: In particular, each of the conditions for which we plan to evaluate our product candidates are rare genetic diseases with limited patient pools from which to draw for clinical trials. Further, because newborn screening for these diseases is not widely adopted, and it can be difficult to diagnose these diseases in the absence of a genetic screen, we may have difficulty finding patients who are eligible to participate in our studies. The eligibility criteria of our clinical trials will further limit the pool of available study participants. Additionally, the process of finding and diagnosing patients may prove costly. The treating physicians in our clinical trials may also use their medical discretion in advising patients enrolled in our clinical trials to withdraw from our studies to try alternative therapies. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic may impact patient ability and willingness to travel to clinical trial sites as a result of quarantines and other restrictions, which may negatively impact enrollment in our clinical trials. - 42 - We may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials if we cannot enroll the required eligible patients per protocol to participate in the clinical trials required by the FDA or the EMA or other regulatory agencies. Our ability to successfully initiate, enroll and complete a clinical trial in any foreign country is subject to numerous risks unique to conducting business in foreign countries, including: If we have difficulty enrolling a sufficient number of patients to conduct our clinical trials as planned, we may need to delay, limit or terminate ongoing or planned clinical trials, any of which would have an adverse effect on our business. Failures or delays in the commencement or completion of ongoing and planned clinical trials of our product candidates negatively impact commercialization efforts; result in increased costs; and delay, prevent or limit our ability to gain regulatory approval of product candidates and to generate revenues and continue our business. Successful completion of clinical trials at each applicable stage of development is a prerequisite to submitting a marketing application to the regulatory agencies and, consequently, the ultimate approval and commercial marketing of any of our product candidates for the indications in which we develop them. We do not know whether any of our clinical trials will begin or be completed, and results announced, as planned or expected, if at all, as the commencement and completion of clinical trials and announcement of results is often delayed or prevented for a number of reasons, including, among others: - 43 - Any inability to complete successfully pre-clinical and clinical development could result in additional costs to us or impair our ability to generate revenues from product sales, regulatory and commercialization milestones and royalties. In addition, manufacturing or formulation changes to our product candidates often require additional studies to demonstrate comparability of the modified product candidates to earlier versions. Clinical study delays also shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, which impairs our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and harms our business and results of operations. Clinical development is lengthy and uncertain. Clinical trials of our novel gene therapy candidates may be delayed, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and certain programs may never advance in the clinic or may be more costly to conduct than we anticipate, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business. Clinical testing is expensive and complex and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. We may not be able to initiate, may experience delays in, or may have to discontinue clinical trials for our product candidates as a result of numerous unforeseen events, including: In addition, the impact of COVID-19 has caused disruptions and may cause future delays in some of our clinical trials. Responses to COVID-19 by healthcare providers and regulatory agencies could delay the commencement of clinical trials, site - 44 - initiation, protocol compliance, or the completion of clinical trials, including the completion of post-marketing requirements and commitments, slow down enrollment, and make the ongoing collection of data for patients enrolled in studies more difficult or intermittent. Results from pre-clinical and early‑stage clinical trials may not be indicative of safety or efficacy in late‑stage clinical trials, and pre-clinical and clinical trials may fail to demonstrate acceptable levels of safety, efficacy, and quality of our product candidates, which could prevent or significantly delay their regulatory approval. To obtain the requisite regulatory approvals to market and sell any of our product candidates, we must demonstrate, through extensive pre-clinical and clinical trials, that the product candidate is safe and effective in humans. Ongoing and future pre-clinical and clinical trials of our product candidates may not show sufficient safety, efficacy or adequate quality to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals. For example, although we believe the data for SRP-9001, SRP-9003 and SRP-5051 collected to date are positive, the additional data we collect may not be consistent with the pre-clinical and/or early clinical data or show a safe benefit that warrants further development or pursuit of a regulatory approval for these product candidates. Furthermore, success in pre-clinical and early clinical trials does not ensure that the subsequent trials will be successful, nor does it predict final results of a confirmatory trial. Some of our clinical trials were conducted with small patient populations and were not blinded or placebo-controlled, making it difficult to predict whether the favorable results that we observed in such trials will be repeated in larger and more advanced clinical trials. For example, our most recent announcements for SRP-9001, SRP-9003 and SRP-5051 include: in July 2022, we announced additional data and analyses from Study 102 and Study 103 for SRP-9001; in May 2021, we announced results from the 30 mg/kg cohort of Part A of Study 5051-201 for SRP-5051; and in March 2022, we announced 24-month functional data from two clinical trial participants in the high-dose cohort, and 36-month functional data from three clinical trial participants in the low-dose cohort for SRP-9003. These data are based on small patient samples, and, given the heterogeneity of Duchenne and LGMD patients and potential lot-to-lot variability, the data may not be predictive of future results. In addition, we cannot assure that the results of additional data or data from any future trial will yield results that are consistent with the data presented, that we will be able to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of these product candidates, that later trial results will support further development, or even if such later results are favorable, that we will be able to successfully complete the development of, obtain accelerated, conditional or standard regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize any of such product candidates. Similarly, we cannot provide assurances that data from our ongoing and planned studies with respect to our commercially approved products and product candidates will be positive and consistent or that the interpretation by regulators, such as the FDA or EMA, of the data we collect for our products or product candidates will be consistent with our interpretations. Our product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of product candidates, limit the commercial potential or result in significant negative consequences following any potential marketing approval. Our product candidates may cause undesirable side effects. In addition to side effects caused by our product candidates, the administration process or related procedures also can cause adverse side effects. If any such adverse events occur in our trials, we may decide, or the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authorities could order us, to halt, delay or amend pre-clinical development or clinical development of our product candidates or we may be unable to receive regulatory approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. For example, FDA placed Study 5051-201 on clinical hold in June 2022 following a serious adverse event of hypomagnesemia, which was lifted in August 2022. Even if we are able to demonstrate that all future serious adverse events are not product-related, such occurrences could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial. Moreover, if we elect, or are required, to delay, suspend or terminate any clinical trial of any of our product candidates, the commercial prospects of such product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate product revenues from any of these product candidates may be delayed or eliminated. Any of these occurrences may harm our ability to develop other product candidates and may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly. Our gene therapy product candidates may be perceived as unsafe or may result in unforeseen adverse events. Failure of other gene therapy programs, negative public opinion and increased regulatory scrutiny of gene therapy may damage public perception of the safety of our gene therapy product candidates and harm our ability to conduct our business or obtain regulatory approvals for our gene therapy product candidates. Gene therapy remains a newly applied technology, with only a few gene therapy products approved to date in the U.S., the EU or elsewhere. Public perception may be influenced by claims that gene therapy is unsafe, and gene therapy may not gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community. In particular, our success will depend upon physicians who specialize in the - 45 - treatment of genetic diseases targeted by our product candidates, prescribing treatments that involve the use of our product candidates in lieu of, or in addition to, existing treatments with which they are familiar and for which greater clinical data may be available. In addition, ethical, social and legal concerns about gene therapy, genetic testing and genetic research could result in additional regulations or prohibiting the processes we may use. Federal and state agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments have expressed their intentions to further regulate biotechnology. More restrictive regulations or claims that our product candidates are unsafe or pose a hazard could prevent us from commercializing any products. New government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, regulations, policies or guidance changed, or interpretations by agencies or courts changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. More restrictive government regulations or negative public opinion would harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and may delay or impair the development and commercialization of our gene therapy product candidates or demand for any products we may develop. For example, earlier gene therapy trials led to several well-publicized adverse events, including death. Lack of efficacy and/or serious adverse events related to clinical trials we, our strategic partners or other companies conduct, even if such adverse events are not ultimately attributable to the relevant product candidates or products, and/or failed commercialization of gene therapy products may result in increased government regulation, unfavorable public perception, potential regulatory delays in the testing or approval of our product candidates, stricter labeling requirements for those product candidates that are approved and a decrease in demand for any such product candidates. If there are significant delays in obtaining or we are unable to obtain or maintain required regulatory approvals, we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates in a timely manner or at all, which could impair our ability to generate sufficient revenue and have a successful business. The research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, commercialization, marketing, selling and distribution of drug products are subject to extensive regulation by applicable local, regional and national regulatory authorities and regulations may differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In the U.S., approvals and oversight from federal (e.g., FDA), state and other regulatory authorities are required for these activities. Sale and marketing of our product candidates in the U.S. or other countries is not permitted until we obtain the required approvals from the applicable regulatory authorities. Of the large number of drugs in development in the biopharmaceutical industry, only a small percentage result in the submission of a marketing application to the FDA or an MAA to the EMA and even fewer are approved for commercialization. Our ability to obtain the government or regulatory approvals required to commercialize any of our product candidates in any jurisdiction, including in the U.S. or the EU, cannot be assured, may be significantly delayed or may never be achieved for various reasons including the following: - 46 - Any failure on our part to respond to these requirements in a timely and satisfactory manner could significantly delay or negatively impact confirmatory study timelines and/or the development plans we have for PMO, PPMO, gene therapy-based product candidates or other product candidates. Responding to requests from regulators and meeting requirements for clinical trials, submissions and approvals may require substantial personnel, financial or other resources, which, as a small biopharmaceutical company, we may not be able to obtain in a timely manner or at all. In addition, our ability to respond to requests from regulatory authorities that involve our agents, third party vendors and associates may be complicated by our own limitations and those of the parties we work with. It may be difficult or impossible for us to conform to regulatory guidance or successfully execute our product development plans in response to regulatory guidance, including guidance related to clinical trial design with respect to any NDA, BLA or MAA submissions. Even if our product candidates demonstrate safety and efficacy in clinical studies, the regulatory agencies may not complete their review processes in a timely manner, or we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval. Additional delays may result if an FDA Advisory Committee or other regulatory advisory group or authority recommends non-approval or restrictions on approval. In addition, we may experience delays or rejections based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action, or changes in regulatory agency policy during the period of product development, clinical studies and the review process. Regulatory agencies also may approve a treatment candidate for fewer or more limited indications than requested or may grant approval subject to the performance of post-marketing studies. Furthermore, regulatory agencies may not approve the labeling claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our treatment candidates. Finally, some of our product candidates may require diagnostic tests to ensure we appropriately select patients suitable for treatment. If we are unable to successfully develop diagnostic tests for these product candidates, experience significant delays in doing so, or are unable to obtain required regulatory clearances or approvals for any diagnostic tests, the commercialization of our product candidates may be delayed or prevented. Even if we receive the required regulatory clearance or approvals for certain diagnostic tests, the commercial success of any of our product candidates that require such tests will be dependent upon the continued availability of such tests. We are investing significant resources in the development of novel gene therapy product candidates. Only a few gene therapy products have been approved in the U.S. and EU. If we are unable to show the safety and efficacy of these product candidates, experience delays in doing so or are unable to successfully commercialize at least one of these drugs, our business would be materially harmed. We are investing significant resources in the development of our gene therapy product candidates. We believe that a significant portion of the long-term value attributed to our company by investors is based on the commercial potential of these product candidates. There can be no assurance that any development problems we experience in the future related to our gene therapy programs will not cause significant delays or unanticipated costs, or that such development problems can be solved. Development problems and delays in one program may delay the development of other programs. Early results from ongoing clinical trials may differ materially from final results from such clinical trials. The results from pre-clinical and early clinical studies do not always accurately predict results in later, large-scale clinical trials. We may also experience delays in developing a sustainable, reproducible and commercial-scale manufacturing process or transferring that process to commercial partners, which may prevent us from completing our clinical trials or commercializing our products on a timely or profitable basis, if at all. In addition, the clinical trial requirements of the FDA, the EMA, and other regulatory agencies and the criteria these regulators use to determine the safety and efficacy of a product candidate vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use and market of the potential products. The regulatory approval process for novel product candidates such as ours can be more expensive and take longer than for other, better known or more extensively studied pharmaceutical or other product candidates. Currently, only a few gene therapy products have been approved in the Western world. Given the few precedents of approved gene therapy products, it is difficult to determine how long it will take or how much it will cost to obtain regulatory approvals for our gene therapy product candidates in the U.S., the EU or other jurisdictions. Approvals by the EMA and the EC may not be indicative of what the FDA may require for approval. Regulatory requirements governing gene therapy products have evolved and may continue to change in the future. Within the FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (“CBER”) regulates gene therapy products. Within the CBER, the review of gene therapy and related products is consolidated in the Office of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies, and the FDA has established - 47 - the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER on its reviews. The CBER works closely with the National Institutes of Health (the “NIH”). The FDA and the NIH have published guidance documents with respect to the development and submission of gene therapy protocols. For example, on January 28, 2020, the FDA issued final guidance documents that updated draft guidance documents that were originally released in July 2018 to reflect recent advances in the field, and to set forth the framework for the development, review and approval of gene therapies. These final guidance documents pertain to the development of gene therapies for the treatment of specific disease categories, including rare diseases, and to manufacturing and long-term follow up issues relevant to gene therapy, among other topics. The FDA also issued a new guidance document in September 2021 describing the FDA’s approach for determining whether two gene therapy products were the same or different for the purpose of assessing orphan drug exclusivity, as well as a draft guidance document in March 2022 on human gene therapy product incorporating human genome editing. In addition, the FDA can put an IND on hold if the information in an IND is not sufficient to assess the risks in pediatric patients. These regulatory review agencies, committees and advisory groups and the new requirements and guidelines they promulgate may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to perform additional or larger studies, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of these treatment candidates or lead to significant post-approval studies, limitations or restrictions. As we advance our product candidates, we will be required to consult with these regulatory and advisory groups and comply with applicable requirements and guidelines, failure of which may lead to delayed or discontinued development of our product candidates. If the anticipated or actual timing of marketing approvals for our gene therapy product candidates, or the market acceptance of these product candidates, if approved, including treatment reimbursement levels agreed to by third-party payors, do not meet the expectations of investors or public market analysts, the market price of our common stock would likely decline. Because we are developing product candidates for the treatment of certain diseases in which there is little clinical experience and we are using new endpoints or methodologies, there is increased risk that the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authorities may not consider the endpoints of our clinical trials to provide clinically meaningful results and that these results may be difficult to analyze. During the FDA review process, we will need to identify success criteria and endpoints such that the FDA will be able to determine the clinical efficacy and safety profile of our product candidates. As we are developing novel treatments for diseases in which there is little clinical experience with new endpoints and methodologies, such as gene therapy, there is heightened risk that the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory bodies may not consider the clinical trial endpoints to provide clinically meaningful results (reflecting a tangible benefit to patients). In addition, the resulting clinical data and results may be difficult to analyze. Even if the FDA does find our success criteria to be sufficiently validated and clinically meaningful, we may not achieve the pre-specified endpoints to a degree of statistical significance. Achieving appropriate statistical power may be challenging for some of the ultra-rare genetically defined diseases we are targeting in our programs, especially if the acceptance of descriptive data is not yet established. In addition, different methodologies, assumptions and applications we utilize to assess particular safety or efficacy parameters may yield different statistical results. Even if we believe the data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates are promising, these data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities. Pre-clinical and clinical data can be interpreted in different ways. Accordingly, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities could interpret these data in different ways from us or our partners, which could delay, limit or prevent full or accelerated regulatory approval. If our study data do not consistently or sufficiently demonstrate the safety or efficacy of any of our product candidates, the regulatory approvals for such product candidates could be significantly delayed as we work to meet approval requirements, or, if we are not able to meet these requirements, such approvals could be withheld or withdrawn. Fast track product, breakthrough therapy, priority review, or Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (“RMAT”) designation by the FDA, or access to the Priority Medicine scheme (“PRIME”) by the EMA, for our product candidates, if granted, may not lead to faster development or regulatory review or approval process, and it does not increase the likelihood that our product candidates will receive marketing approval. We may seek fast track, breakthrough therapy designation, RMAT designation, PRIME scheme access or priority review designation for our product candidates if supported by the results of clinical trials. A fast track product designation is designed to facilitate the clinical development and expedite the review of drugs intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition which demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. A RMAT designation is designed to accelerate approval for regenerative advanced therapies such as our gene therapy product candidates. Priority review designation is intended to - 48 - speed the FDA marketing application review timeframe for drugs that treat a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. PRIME is a scheme provided by the EMA to enhance support for the development of medicines that target an unmet medical need. For drugs and biologics that have been designated as fast track products or breakthrough therapies, or granted access to the PRIME scheme, interaction and communication between the regulatory agency and the sponsor of the trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development. Sponsors of drugs with fast track products or breakthrough therapies may also be able to submit marketing applications on a rolling basis, meaning that the FDA may review portions of a marketing application before the sponsor submits the complete application to the FDA, if the sponsor pays the user fee upon submission of the first portion of the marketing application. For products that receive a priority review designation, the FDA's marketing application review goal is shortened to six months, as opposed to ten months under standard review. This review goal is based on the date the FDA accepts the marketing application for review, this application validation period typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. RMAT designations will accelerate approval and will include all the benefits of fast track and breakthrough therapy designations, including early interactions with the FDA, but the exact mechanisms have not yet been announced by FDA. Designation as a fast track product, breakthrough therapy, RMAT, PRIME, or priority review product is within the discretion of the regulatory agency. Accordingly, even if we believe one of our product candidates meets the criteria for designation as a fast track product, breakthrough therapy, RMAT, PRIME, or priority review product, the agency may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation. In any event, the receipt of such a designation for a product candidate may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional regulatory procedures and does not assure ultimate marketing approval by the agency. In addition, regarding fast track products and breakthrough therapies, the FDA may later decide that the products no longer meet the conditions for qualification as either a fast track product, RMAT, or a breakthrough therapy or, for priority review products, decide that period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. We may not be able to advance all of our programs, and we may use our financial and human resources to pursue particular programs and fail to capitalize on programs that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success. Our pipeline includes more than 40 programs in various stages of development for a broad range of diseases and disorders. We plan to expand our pipeline through internal research and development and through strategic transactions. Because we have limited resources, we may not be able to advance all of our programs. We may also forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with certain programs or for indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs for product candidates may not yield any commercially viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through strategic collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate, or we may allocate internal resources to a product candidate in a therapeutic area in which it would have been more advantageous to enter into a partnering arrangement. Risks Related to Third Parties If we are unable to maintain our agreements with third parties to distribute our products to patients, our results of operations and business could be adversely affected. We rely on third parties to commercially distribute our products to patients in the U.S. We have contracted with a third-party logistics company to warehouse our products and with distributors and specialty pharmacies to sell and distribute our products to patients. A specialty pharmacy is a pharmacy that specializes in the dispensing of medications for complex or chronic conditions that require a high level of patient education and ongoing management. This distribution network requires significant coordination with our sales and marketing and finance organizations. In addition, failure to coordinate financial systems could negatively impact our ability to accurately report product revenue from our products. If we are unable to effectively manage the distribution process, the sales of our products, as well as any future products we may commercialize, could be delayed or severely compromised and our results of operations may be harmed. - 49 - In addition, the use of third parties involves certain risks, including, but not limited to, risks that these organizations will: Any such events may result in decreased product sales, lower product revenue, loss of revenue, and/or reputational damage, which would harm our results of operations and business. With respect to the pre-commercial distribution of our products to patients outside of the U.S., we have contracted with third party distributors and service providers to distribute our products in certain countries through our EAP. We will need to continue building out our network for commercial distribution in jurisdictions in which our products are approved, which will also require third party contracts. The use of distributors and service providers involves certain risks, including, but not limited to, risks that these organizations will not comply with applicable laws and regulations, or not provide us with accurate or timely information regarding serious adverse events and/or product complaints regarding our products. Any such events may result in regulatory actions that may include suspension or termination of the distribution and sale of our products in a certain country, loss of revenue, and/or reputational damage, which could harm our results of operations and business. Furthermore, a significant outbreak of COVID-19 at one of our third-party logistics, distribution, or specialty pharmacy sites could lead to a delay in the commercial or pre-commercial shipments of our products to patients and hospitals. We rely on third parties to conduct some aspects of our early stage research and pre-clinical and clinical development. The inadequate performance by or loss of any of these third parties could affect the development and commercialization of our product candidate development. We have relied upon, and plan to continue to rely upon, third parties to conduct some aspects of our early stage research and pre-clinical and clinical development with respect to certain of our product candidates, including our follow-on exon-skipping product candidates, PPMO, gene therapy and gene editing product candidates. Our third-party collaborators may not commit sufficient resources or adequately develop our programs for these candidates. If our third-party collaborators fail to commit sufficient resources to any of our product candidates or to carry out their contractual duties or obligations, our programs related to any particular product candidate could be delayed, terminated, or unsuccessful. Furthermore, if we fail to make required payments to these third-party collaborators, including up-front, milestone, reimbursement or royalty payments, or to observe other obligations in our agreements with them, these third parties may not be required to perform their obligations under our respective agreements with them and may have the right to terminate such agreements. In addition, if our strategic partners experience regulatory delays for the development of their clinical product candidates, including clinical holds, our opportunities to commercialize products may be delayed. We also have relied upon and plan to continue to rely upon third-party CROs to monitor and manage data completeness for our ongoing pre-clinical and clinical programs. We rely on these parties for execution of our pre-clinical and clinical trials, and we control only certain aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol and legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on collaborators and CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. The individuals at our third-party collaborators and CROs who conduct work on our behalf, including their sub-contractors, are not always our employees, and although we participate in the planning of our early stage research and pre-clinical and clinical programs, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources or exercise appropriate oversight of these programs, except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such third parties. If our collaborators and CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our pre-clinical and clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates. As a result, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed. - 50 - Our reliance on third parties requires us to share our proprietary information, which increases the possibility that a competitor will discover them or that our proprietary information will be misappropriated or inadvertently disclosed. Our reliance on third-party collaborators requires us to disclose our proprietary information to these parties, which could increase the risk that a competitor will discover this information or that this information will be misappropriated or disclosed without our intent to do so. If any of these events were to occur, then our ability to obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights could be irrevocably jeopardized, and costly, distracting litigation could ensue. Furthermore, if these third parties cease to continue operations and we are not able to quickly find a replacement provider or we lose information or items associated with our products or product candidates, our development programs may be delayed. Although we carefully manage our relationships with our third-party collaborators and CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects. Risks Related to Manufacturing We currently rely on third parties to manufacture our products and to produce our product candidates; our dependence on these parties, including failure on our part to accurately anticipate product demand and timely secure manufacturing capacity to meet commercial, EAP, clinical and pre-clinical product demand may impair the availability of product for commercial supply or to successfully support various programs, including research and development and the potential commercialization of additional product candidates in our pipeline. We rely on, and expect to continue relying on for the foreseeable future, a limited number of third parties to manufacture and supply materials (including raw materials and subunits), API and drug product and to provide labeling and packaging of vials and storage of our products and product candidates. The limited number of third parties with facilities and capabilities suited for the manufacturing process of our products and product candidates creates a risk that we may not be able to obtain materials and APIs in the quantity and purity that we require. As of the date of this Annual Report, we have dual sourcing for the APIs and drug product for all three of our commercial products. In addition, the process for adding new manufacturing capacity is lengthy and often causes delays in development efforts. Any interruption of the development or operation of those facilities due to, among other reasons, events such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, order delays for equipment or materials, equipment malfunctions, quality control and quality assurance issues, regulatory delays and possible negative effects of such delays on supply chains and expected timelines for product availability, production yield issues, shortages of qualified personnel, discontinuation of a facility or business or failure or damage to a facility by natural disasters, such as earthquakes or fires, could result in the cancellation of shipments, loss of product in the manufacturing process or a shortfall in supply of our products, product candidates or materials. If these third parties cease providing quality manufacturing and related services to us, and we are not able to engage appropriate replacements in a timely manner, our ability to manufacture our products or product candidates in sufficient quality and quantity required for our planned commercial, pre-clinical and clinical or EAPs, our various product research, development and commercialization efforts would be adversely affected. Furthermore, any problems in our manufacturing process or the facilities with which we contract make us a less attractive collaborator for potential partners, including larger pharmaceutical companies and academic research institutions, which could limit our access to additional attractive development programs. We, through our third-party manufacturers, seek to produce or produce supply of our products and product candidates. In light of the limited number of third parties with the expertise to produce our products and product candidates, the lead time needed to manufacture them, and the availability of underlying materials, we may not be able to, in a timely manner or at all, establish or maintain sufficient commercial and other manufacturing arrangements on the commercially reasonable terms necessary to provide adequate supply of our products and product candidates. Furthermore, we may not be able to obtain the significant financial capital that may be required in connection with such arrangements. Even after successfully engaging third parties to execute the manufacturing process for our products and product candidates, such parties may not comply with the terms and timelines they have agreed to for various reasons, some of which may be out of their or our control, which impacts our ability to execute our business plans on expected or required timelines in connection with the commercialization of our products and the continued development of our product candidates. When we enter into long-term manufacturing agreements that contain exclusivity provisions and /or substantial termination penalties, we constrain our operational flexibility. The operations at one of our partner sites could also be disturbed by man-made or natural disasters, public health pandemics or epidemics or other business interrupts such as potential supply chain disruptions caused by the ongoing conflict between Russia and - 51 - Ukraine. In addition, the need to prioritize rated orders issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency pursuant to the U.S. Defense Production Act could impact the manufacturing, supply chain and distribution of our products and product candidates. The third parties we use in the manufacturing process for our products and product candidates may fail to comply with cGMP regulations. Our contract manufacturers are required to produce our materials, APIs and drug products under cGMP. We and our contract manufacturers are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA, EMA and corresponding state and foreign authorities to ensure strict compliance with cGMP and other applicable government regulations. In addition, before we can begin to commercially manufacture our product candidates in third-party or our own facilities, we must obtain regulatory approval from the FDA, which includes a review of the manufacturing process and facility. A manufacturing authorization also must be obtained from the appropriate EU regulatory authorities and may be required by other foreign regulatory authorities. The timeframe required to obtain such approval or authorization is uncertain. In order to obtain approval, we need to demonstrate that all of our processes, methods and equipment are compliant with cGMP, and perform extensive audits of vendors, contract laboratories and suppliers. In complying with cGMP, we are obligated to expend time, money and effort in production, record keeping and quality control to seek to assure that the product meets applicable specifications and other requirements. We do not have direct operational control over a third-party manufacturer’s compliance with regulations and requirements. In addition, changes in cGMP could negatively impact the ability of our contract manufacturers to complete the manufacturing process of our products and product candidates in a compliant manner on the schedule we require for commercial and clinical trial use, respectively. Failure to achieve and maintain compliance with cGMP and other applicable government regulations, including failure to detect or control anticipated or unanticipated manufacturing errors, results in product recalls, clinical holds, delayed or withheld approvals, patient injury or death. Failure by our contract manufacturers to adhere to applicable cGMP and other applicable government regulations, or our contract manufacturers experiencing manufacturing problems, may result in significant negative consequences, including product seizures or recalls, postponement or cancellation of clinical trials, loss or delay of product approval, fines and sanctions, loss of revenue, termination of the development of a product candidate, reputational damage, shipment delays, inventory shortages, inventory write-offs and other product-related charges and increased manufacturing costs. If we experience any of these consequences, the success of our commercialization of our products and/or our development efforts for our product candidates could be significantly delayed, fail or otherwise be negatively impacted. We may not be able to successfully optimize manufacturing of our product candidates in sufficient quality and quantity or within targeted timelines, or be able to secure ownership of intellectual property rights developed in this process, which could negatively impact the commercial success of our products and/or the development of our product candidates. Our focus remains on optimizing manufacturing for our follow-on exon skipping product candidates and other programs, including PPMO and gene therapy. We may not be able to successfully increase manufacturing capacity for the production of materials, APIs and drug products, whether in collaboration with third party manufacturers or on our own, in a manner that is safe, compliant with cGMP conditions or other applicable legal or regulatory requirements, in a cost-effective manner, in a time frame required to meet our timeline for commercialization, clinical trials and other business plans, or at all. Challenges complying with cGMP requirements and other quality issues arise during efforts to increase manufacturing capacity and scale up production. We experience such issues in connection with manufacturing, packaging and storage of our products and product candidates, and during shipping and storage of the APIs or finished drug product. In addition, in order to release our products for commercial use and demonstrate stability of product candidates for use in clinical trials (and any subsequent drug products for commercial use), our manufacturing processes and analytical methods must be validated in accordance with regulatory guidelines. Failure to successfully validate, or maintain validation of, our manufacturing processes and analytical methods or demonstrate adequate purity, stability or comparability of our products or product candidates in a timely or cost-effective manner, or at all, may undermine our commercial efforts. Failure to successfully validate our manufacturing processes and analytical methods or to demonstrate adequate purity, stability or comparability, will negatively impact the commercial availability of our products and the continued development and/or regulatory approval of our product candidates, which could significantly harm our business. During our work with our third-party manufacturers to increase and optimize manufacturing capacity, they may make proprietary improvements in the manufacturing processes for our products or product candidates. We may not own or be able to secure ownership of such improvements or may have to share the intellectual property rights to those improvements. Additionally, we may need additional processes, technologies and validation studies, which could be costly and which we may not be able to develop or acquire from third parties. Failure to secure the intellectual property rights required for the manufacturing process needed for large-scale clinical trials or the continued development of our product candidates could cause significant delays in our business plans or otherwise negatively impact the continued development of our product candidates. - 52 - Products intended for use in gene therapies are novel, complex and difficult to manufacture. We could experience production problems that result in delays in our development or commercialization of gene therapy programs, limit the supply of our product candidates or future approved products or otherwise harm our business. We currently have development, manufacturing and testing agreements with third parties to manufacture supplies of our gene therapy product candidates. Several factors could cause production interruptions, including equipment malfunctions, facility contamination, raw material shortages or contamination, natural disasters, disruption in utility services, human error or disruptions in the operations of suppliers. The physical and chemical properties of biologics such as ours generally cannot be fully characterized. As a result, assays of the finished product may not be sufficient to ensure that the product will perform in the intended manner. Accordingly, we employ multiple steps to control our manufacturing process to assure that the process works and the product candidate is made strictly and consistently in compliance with the process. Problems with the manufacturing process, even minor deviations from the normal process, could result in product defects or manufacturing failures that result in lot failures, product recalls, product liability claims or insufficient inventory. We may encounter problems achieving adequate quantities and quality of clinical and/or commercial-grade materials that meet FDA, EMA or other applicable foreign standards or specifications with consistent and acceptable production yields and costs. In addition, the FDA, the EMA and other foreign regulatory authorities may require us to submit samples of any lot of any approved product together with the protocols showing the results of applicable tests at any time. Under some circumstances, the FDA, the EMA or other foreign regulatory authorities may require that we not distribute a lot until the competent authority authorizes its release. Slight deviations in the manufacturing process, including those affecting quality attributes and stability and deviations among different sites, may result in unacceptable changes in the product that could result in lot failures or product recalls. Lot failures or product recalls could cause us to delay clinical trials or product launches which could be costly to us and otherwise harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. As our product candidates advance to later stage clinical trials, it is customary that various aspects of the development program, such as manufacturing, formulation and other processes, and methods of administration, may be altered to optimize the candidates and processes for scale-up necessary for later stage clinical trials and potential approval and commercialization. These changes may not produce the intended optimization, including production of drug substance and drug product of a quality and in a quantity sufficient for Phase 3 clinical stage development or for commercialization, which may cause delays in the initiation or completion of clinical trials and greater costs. We may also need to conduct additional studies to demonstrate comparability between newly manufactured drug substance and/or drug product for commercialization relative to previously manufactured drug substance and/or drug product for clinical trials. Demonstrating comparability may require us to incur additional costs or delay initiation or completion of clinical trials and, if unsuccessful, could require us to complete additional pre-clinical studies or clinical trials. We also may encounter problems hiring and retaining the experienced scientific, quality control and manufacturing personnel needed to operate our manufacturing process which could result in delays in our production or difficulties in maintaining compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. Currently the capacity to produce our viral vectors or gene therapy product candidates at commercial levels is limited and the availability of sufficient GMP compliance capacity may result in delays in our development plans or increased capital expenditures, and the development and sales of any gene therapy products, if approved, may be materially harmed. Risks Related to our Intellectual Property Our success, competitive position and future revenue depend in part on our ability and the abilities of our licensors and other collaborators to obtain, maintain and defend the patent protection for our products, product candidates, and platform technologies, to preserve our trade secrets, and to prevent third parties from infringing on our proprietary rights. We currently directly hold various issued patents and patent applications, or have exclusive license or option rights to issued patents and patent applications, in each case in the U.S. as well as other countries that protect our products, product candidates and platform technologies. We anticipate filing additional patent applications both in the U.S. and in other countries. Our success will depend, in significant part, on our ability to obtain, maintain and defend our U.S. and foreign patents covering our products, product candidates and platform technologies as well as preserving our trade secrets for these assets. The patent process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining, maintaining, or defending our patents. - 53 - Even when our patent claims are allowed, the claims may not issue, or in the event of issuance, may not be sufficient to protect our products, product candidates or platform technologies or may be challenged in post-grant proceedings by third parties. The patent positions of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. This uncertainty is heightened for our PMO-based products and product candidates and gene therapy-based product candidates for which there has not been a significant number of patent litigations involving such technologies. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents has emerged to date in the U.S. and tests used for determining the patentability of patent claims in all technologies are in flux. The USPTO and patent offices in other jurisdictions have often required that patent applications directed to pharmaceutical and/or biotechnology-related inventions be limited or narrowed substantially to cover only the specific innovations exemplified in the patent application, thereby limiting the scope of protection against competitive challenges. Accordingly, even if we or our licensors are able to obtain patents, the patents might be substantially narrower than anticipated. Thus, there is no assurance as to the degree and range of protections any of our patents, if issued, may afford us or whether patents will be issued. Patents which may be issued to us may be subjected to further governmental review that may ultimately result in the reduction of their scope of protection, and pending patent applications may have their requested breadth of protection significantly limited before being issued, if issued at all. The pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences patent situation outside the U.S. can be even more uncertain. As a matter of public policy, there might be significant pressure on governmental bodies to limit the scope of patent protection or impose compulsory licenses for disease treatments that prove successful, particularly as a tactic to impose a price control. Additionally, competitors may leverage such pressure to enhance their ability to exploit these laws to create, develop and market competing products. We may be able to assert that certain activities engaged in by our competitors infringe on our current or future patent rights. To the extent that we enforce our patents, an alleged infringer may deny infringement and/or counter-claim that our patents are not valid or enforceable, and if successful, could negatively impact our patent estate. We may not be able to successfully defend patents necessary to prevent competitors from developing, manufacturing, or commercializing competing product candidates or products. To the extent we assert infringement of a patent that covers a competing product candidate or product as well as our own product candidate(s) or product(s), or such a patent is otherwise challenged without our initiation, the patent protection for our own product candidate(s) or product(s) could be materially adversely affected should an infringing competitor be successful in challenging the validity, enforceability, or scope of our patent(s). Our patent rights might be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or otherwise not provide any competitive advantage. Defending our patent positions may require significant financial resources and could negatively impact other Company objectives. Even if we successfully enforce our patent rights against a competitor, we may not be able to recover adequate damages or obtain other desired relief. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, one or more motivated third parties may file an ANDA, seeking approval of a generic copy of an innovator product approved under the NDA pathway such as our PMO products, or an NDA under Section 505(b)(2), for a new or improved version of the original innovator products. In certain circumstances, motivated third parties may file such an ANDA or NDA under Section 505(b)(2) as early as the so-called “NCE-1” date that is one year before the expiry of the five-year period of NCE exclusivity or more generally four years after NDA approval. The third parties are allowed to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the innovator’s product, may not need to conduct clinical trials and can market a competing version of a product after the expiration or loss of patent exclusivity or the expiration or loss of regulatory exclusivity and often charge significantly lower prices. Upon the expiration or loss of patent protection or the expiration or loss of regulatory exclusivity for a product, the major portion of revenues for that product may be dramatically reduced in a very short period of time. If we are not successful in defending our patents and regulatory exclusivities, we will not derive the expected benefit from them. As such, a third party could be positioned to market an ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) product that competes with one of our products prior to the expiry of our patents if the third party successfully challenges the validity, enforceability, or scope of our patents protecting the product. The patent landscape is continually evolving, and we may be able to assert that certain activities engaged in by third parties infringe our current or future patent rights. There has been, and we believe that there will continue to be, significant litigation in the biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical industries regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. As such, the patents and patent applications that we own, license, have optioned, and rely on for exclusivity for our product candidates may be challenged. Uncertainty over intellectual property in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry has been the source of litigation and other disputes, which is inherently costly and unpredictable. Litigation, interferences, oppositions, inter partes reviews, administrative challenges or other similar types of proceedings are, have been and may in the future be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of certain of our proprietary rights, and in other instances to determine the validity, enforceability, scope or non-infringement of certain patent rights claimed by third parties to be pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our product candidates or products. We may also face challenges to our patent and regulatory exclusivities covering our products by third parties, including manufacturers of generics and/or biosimilars who - 54 - may choose to launch or attempt to launch their products before the expiration of our patents or regulatory exclusivity. Litigation, interferences, oppositions, inter partes reviews, administrative challenges or other similar types of proceedings are unpredictable and may be protracted, expensive and distracting to management. The outcomes of such proceedings could adversely affect the validity, enforceability, and scope of our patents or other proprietary rights, hinder our ability to manufacture and market our products, require us to seek a license for the infringed products or technology or result in the assessment of significant monetary damages against us that may exceed amounts, if any, accrued in our financial statements. An adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or a failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from developing, manufacturing or selling our products. Furthermore, payments under any licenses that we are able to obtain would reduce our profits derived from our products. Any of these circumstances could result in financial, business or reputational harm to us or could cause a decline or volatility in our stock price. On September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (the “Leahy-Smith Act”), was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law, including provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted, and that may also affect patent litigation. The USPTO has issued regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act. In view of the long timelines for interpreting legal provisions in the court system and the evolving nature of our laws, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. For instance, a third party may petition the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“PTAB”) seeking to challenge some or all of the claims in any of our patents through an inter partes review or other post-grant proceedings. Should the PTAB or the USPTO Director institute an inter partes review or other proceedings and the PTAB decide that some or all of the claims in the challenged patent are unpatentable, unenforceable, or invalid, such a decision, if upheld on appeal, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Our business prospects will be impaired if third parties successfully assert that our products, product candidates, or platform technologies infringe proprietary rights of such third parties. Similar to us, competitors continually seek intellectual property protection for their technology. Several of our development programs, particularly gene therapy programs, focus on therapeutic areas that have been the subject of extensive research and development by third parties for many years and have been protected with third party patent rights. Due to the amount of intellectual property in our various fields of technology, we cannot be certain that we do not infringe intellectual property rights of competitors or other third parties or that we will not infringe intellectual property rights of competitors or other third parties granted or created in the future. Moreover, activities we conduct or those conducted on our behalf in connection with the development of our product candidates may not be protected from infringement under the so-called Safe Harbor provision of 35 U.S.C. § 271(e)(1) and thus may be found to infringe the patent rights of third parties. Our competitors or other third parties might have obtained, or could obtain in the future, patents that threaten, limit, interfere with or eliminate our ability to make, use and sell our products, product candidates or platform technologies in important commercial markets. Due to the nature of our various partnerships, collaborators, licensors, CROs, CMOs and the like, we may be subjected to claims of infringement arising from activities conducted by these third parties in connection with our product candidates, whether or not such activities are authorized by us. In addition, we may have contractual obligations to indemnify these partners from claims of infringement or declaratory relief. As a result, we may be subject to substantial unforeseen costs, distraction, and financial liability if a third party making such a claim was successful in obtaining a final judgment of infringement and validity. In order to maintain or obtain freedom to operate for our products and product candidates, we may incur significant expenses, including those associated with entering into agreements with third parties that require milestone and royalty payments. Additionally, if we were to challenge the patent rights of our competitors or otherwise defend against allegations of infringement, misappropriation, breach of contract or related claims, we could incur substantial costs and ultimately might not be successful. If our products, product candidates, or platform technologies are alleged to infringe or are determined to infringe enforceable proprietary rights of others, we could incur substantial costs and may have to: - 55 - Any of these events could result in product and product candidate development delays or cessation, and as such substantially harm our potential earnings, financial condition and operations. The patent landscape of our product candidates and products is continually evolving and multiple parties, including both commercial entities and academic institutions, may have rights to claims or may be pursuing additional claims that could provide these parties a basis to assert that our products, product candidates or platform technologies infringe on the intellectual property rights of such parties. There has been, and we believe that there will continue to be, significant litigation in the biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical industries regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Risks Related to our Business Operations Failure to comply with healthcare and other regulations is subject to substantial penalties and our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. As a manufacturer of pharmaceuticals, within the U.S., certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations apply to or affect our business. These laws may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we conduct business, including how we conduct research regarding, market, sell, and distribute our products. The laws and regulations include: The number and complexity of both federal and state laws continues to increase, and additional governmental resources are being used to enforce these laws and to prosecute companies and individuals who are believed to be violating them. We anticipate that government scrutiny of pharmaceutical sales and marketing practices will continue for the foreseeable future and subject us to the risk of government investigations and enforcement actions. We have implemented a compliance program, which is based on industry best practices and is designed to ensure that our activities comply with all applicable laws, regulations and industry standards. While our compliance program is intended to detect and prevent potential non-compliance, we cannot be certain that compliance will be assured. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other laws, rules or regulations that apply to us, we will be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Responding to government investigations, defending any claims raised, and any resulting fines, restitution, damages and penalties, settlement payments or administrative actions, as well as any related actions brought by stockholders or other third parties, could have a material impact on our reputation, business and financial condition and divert the attention of our management from operating our business. Even if we successfully defend against an action against us for violation of a law, the action and our defense could nonetheless cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state privacy, security, fraud and reporting laws may prove costly. - 56 - If we, our collaborators, or any third-party manufacturers engaged by us or our collaborators fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could harm our business. We, our collaborators, and any third-party manufacturers we engage are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the generation, handling, use, storage, treatment, manufacture, transportation and disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous materials and wastes, as well as laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety, including those governing laboratory procedures, exposure to blood-borne pathogens and the handling of bio-hazardous materials. Our operations involve the use of hazardous materials, including organic and inorganic solvents and reagents. Although we believe that our activities conform in all material respects with such environmental laws, there can be no assurance that violations of these laws will not occur in the future as a result of human error, accident, equipment failure or other causes. Liability under environmental, health and safety laws can be joint and several and without regard to fault or negligence. The failure to comply with past, present or future laws could result in the imposition of substantial fines and penalties, remediation costs, property damage and personal injury claims, loss of permits or a cessation of operations, and any of these events could harm our business and financial condition. We expect that our operations will be affected by other new environmental, health and workplace safety laws on an ongoing basis, and although we cannot predict the ultimate impact of any such new laws, they may impose greater compliance costs or result in increased risks or penalties, which could harm our business. Further, with respect to the operations of any current or future collaborators or third party contract manufacturers, it is possible that if they fail to operate in compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or properly dispose of wastes associated with our product or product candidates, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, suffer reputational harm or experience a disruption in the manufacture and supply of our product or product candidates. Comprehensive tax reform in the U.S. and future guidance could adversely affect our business and financial condition. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”) was enacted on December 22, 2017 in the U.S. The TCJA contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, elimination of U.S. tax on foreign earnings (subject to certain important exceptions), one-time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense, immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits. On March 27, 2020, President Trump signed into law the “Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act” or the CARES Act, which included certain changes in tax law intended to stimulate the U.S. economy in light of the COVID-19 outbreak, including temporary beneficial changes to the treatment of net operating losses, interest deductibility limitations and payroll tax matters. We continue to monitor changes in tax laws in the U.S. and the impact of proposed and enacted legislation in the international jurisdictions in which the company operates, which could materially impact our tax provision, cash tax liability and effective tax rate. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted, and may continue to result in disruptions to our commercialization, clinical trials, manufacturing and other business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and prospects. The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a substantial public health and economic challenge around the world. The rapid spread of COVID-19 has led to the implementation of various responses, including government-imposed quarantines, shelter-in-place mandates, sweeping restrictions on travel, mandatory shutdowns for non-essential businesses, requirements regarding social distancing, and other public health safety measures, as well as reported adverse impacts on healthcare resources, facilities and providers across the United States and in other countries. In response to the pandemic, healthcare providers have, and may need to further, reallocate resources, such as physicians, staff, hospital beds, and intensive care unit facilities, as they prioritize limited resources and personnel capacity to focus on the treatment of patients with COVID-19 and implement limitations on access to hospitals and other medical institutions due to concerns about the spread of COVID-19 in such settings. These responses may be extended by the duration of the outbreak, periodic spikes in infection rates due to new strains of the virus, new information that will emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and the actions to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact. These actions have and may continue to negatively impact commercialization, clinical trials, manufacturing and other business operations, including: - 57 - Any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and prospects. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our operations and those of our third-party partners will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the pandemic, additional or modified government actions, new information which emerges concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions taken to contain the virus or treat its impact, among others. In particular, the speed of the continued spread of COVID-19 globally, and the magnitude of interventions to contain the spread of the virus, will determine the impact of the pandemic on our operations. Our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset future taxable income may be limited by provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, and it is possible that certain transactions or a combination of certain transactions may result in material additional limitations on our ability to use our net operating losses. We have incurred substantial losses during our history and expect to incur more as we pursue our business strategy. To the extent that we continue to generate taxable losses, unused losses will carry forward to offset a portion of future taxable income, if any, subject to expiration of such carryforwards in the case of carryforwards generated prior to January 1, 2018. In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, a corporation that undergoes an “ownership change” is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses and certain other tax assets (including R&D tax credits) to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders increases by more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders’ lowest percentage ownership during the testing period, which is generally three years. An ownership change could limit our ability to utilize our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for taxable years including or following such “ownership change.” Such limitations may result in expiration of a portion of the net operating loss carryforwards incurred prior to 2018 before utilization and may be substantial. If such change has occurred or does occur, the tax benefits related to the net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax assets may be limited or lost. Moreover, proposed U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 382 of the Code could, if finalized, significantly impact a corporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards or other attributes following an ownership change. Limitations imposed on the ability to use net operating losses and tax credits to offset future taxable income could require us to pay U.S. federal income taxes earlier than we estimated or than would have otherwise been required if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such net operating losses and tax credits to expire unused, in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such net operating losses and tax credits and potentially adversely affecting our financial position. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes. At the state level, there may also be periods during which the use of net operating loss carryforwards or other attributes is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed. These net operating losses have been fully offset by a valuation allowance due to uncertainties surrounding our ability to realize these tax benefits. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which includes changes to the U.S. federal taxation of corporations, was enacted into law. The Inflation Reduction Act among other things implements a corporate book minimum tax (“BMT”) 15% rate that could apply to consolidated groups of companies with adjusted financial statement income in excess of $1.0 billion over a three-year period. The BMT has various limitations, including a more restrictive limit on availability of net operating loss carryforwards, which if applied to us, could impact its cash tax liability and ability to utilize tax attributes. - 58 - In addition, many of the jurisdictions in which we operate have or are expected to adopt changes to tax laws as a result of the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting final proposals from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and specific country anti-avoidance initiatives. In addition, the current proposal of the BMT may result in increases in tax imposed by non-U.S. jurisdictions. Such tax law changes and anti-avoidance initiatives increase uncertainty and may adversely affect our tax provision, cash tax liability and effective tax rate. We are winding down our expired U.S. government contracts, and the U.S. government may deny payment of some or all of the currently outstanding amounts owed to us. In addition, further development of our infectious disease programs may be limited by the intellectual property and other rights retained by the U.S. government. We have historically relied on U.S. government contracts and awards to fund and support certain infectious disease development programs. These contracts expired and we are currently involved in contract close-out activities. The U.S. government has the right to perform additional audits prior to making final payment of costs and fees. If we are not able to adequately support costs incurred or other government requirements, the government may deny payment of some or all of the currently outstanding amounts owed to us. In addition, the U.S. government may have the right to develop all or some parts of product candidates that we have developed under a U.S. government contract after such contract has terminated or expired. Our employees, principal investigators, consultants and strategic partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading. We are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees, principal investigators, consultants and strategic partners. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional failures to comply with the regulations of the FDA and non-U.S. regulators, provide accurate information to the FDA and non-U.S. regulators, comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. We adopted a code of conduct applicable to all of our employees, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions. Failure to retain our key personnel or an inability to attract and retain additional qualified personnel would cause our future growth and our ability to compete to suffer. We are highly dependent on the efforts and abilities of the principal members of our senior management. Additionally, we have scientific personnel with significant and unique expertise in RNA-targeted therapeutics and gene therapy technologies. The loss of the services of any one of the principal members of our managerial team or staff may prevent us from achieving our business objectives. The competition for qualified personnel in the biotechnology field is intense, and our future success depends upon our ability to attract, retain, motivate and support such personnel. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated workforce competition and workforce shortages. In order to develop and commercialize our products successfully, we will be required to retain key management and scientific employees. In certain instances, we may also need to expand or replace our workforce and our management ranks. In addition, we rely on certain consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in the formulation and advancement of our research and development programs. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by other entities or have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with third parties that limit their availability to us, or both. If we are unable to attract, assimilate or retain such key personnel, our ability to advance our programs would be adversely affected. Turnover rates of key employees has varied substantially in recent years. Over the last few years, we have had several executive management changes. Leadership transitions can be inherently difficult to manage and may cause uncertainty or a disruption to our business or may increase the likelihood of turnover in other key officers and employees. If we lose the services of one or more of our senior management or key employees, or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise to compete with us, our business could be harmed. - 59 - Risks Related to our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements We have incurred operating losses since our inception and we may not achieve or sustain profitability. We incurred an operating loss of $536.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our accumulated deficit was $3.9 billion as of December 31, 2022. Although we currently have three commercially approved products in the U.S., we believe that it will take us some time to attain profitability and positive cash flow from operations. Since our products and product candidates target small patient populations, the per-patient drug pricing must be high in order to recover our development and manufacturing costs, fund adequate patient support programs, fund additional research and achieve profitability. We may be unable to maintain or obtain sufficient sales volumes at a price high enough to justify our product development efforts and our sales, marketing and manufacturing expenses. We have generally incurred expenses related to research and development of our technologies and product candidates and from general and administrative expenses that we have incurred while building our business infrastructure. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if and/or as we: As a result, we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses at least through 2023. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing biopharmaceutical products, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when, or if, we will become profitable. We may need to raise additional funding, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed may force us to delay, limit or terminate our product development efforts or other operations. We may require additional capital from time to time in the future in order to meet FDA post-marketing approval requirements and market and sell our products as well as to continue the development of product candidates in our pipeline, to prepare for potential commercialization of additional product candidates in our pipeline, to expand our product portfolio and to continue or enhance our business development efforts. The actual amount of funds that we may need and the sufficiency of the capital we have or are able to raise will be determined by many factors, some of which are in our control and others that are beyond our control. While we are currently well capitalized, we may use available capital resources sooner than we expect under our current operating plan. In addition, our operating plan may change. We may need or choose to seek additional funds sooner than planned, through equity or debt financings, government or other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic alliances, funded research and development arrangements and licensing arrangements or a combination of these approaches. In any event, we expect to require additional capital to expand future development efforts, obtain regulatory approval for, and to commercialize, our product candidates. Raising funds in the current economic environment may present additional challenges. Even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans, we may seek additional capital if market conditions are favorable or in light of specific strategic considerations. - 60 - Any additional fundraising efforts may divert our management from their day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates. In addition, we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In the event we receive negative data from our key clinical programs or encounter other major setbacks in our development, manufacturing or regulatory activities or in our commercialization efforts, our stock price is likely to decline, which would make a future financing more difficult. Moreover, the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders. The issuance of additional securities, whether equity or debt, by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our shares to decline. The sale of additional equity or convertible securities may dilute all of our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness may result in increased fixed payment obligations and we may be required to agree to certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. We could also be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or otherwise at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable and we may be required to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product candidates or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects. If we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, we may be required to significantly curtail, delay or discontinue one or more of our research or development programs or the commercialization of any product, if approved, or be unable to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, as desired, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Raising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights. We may seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations and strategic and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of common stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock, the ownership interest of our stockholders in our company may be diluted. In addition, the terms of any such securities may include liquidation or other preferences that materially adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may increase our fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaboration, strategic partnerships and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our product candidates, our intellectual property, future revenue streams or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. The estimates and judgments we make, or the assumptions on which we rely, in preparing our consolidated financial statements could prove inaccurate. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the amounts of charges accrued by us and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Such estimates and judgments include revenue recognition, inventory, valuation of stock-based awards, research and development expenses and income tax. We base our estimates on historical experience, facts and circumstances known to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We cannot provide assurances, however, that our estimates, or the assumptions underlying them, will not change over time or otherwise prove inaccurate. If this is the case, we may be required to restate our consolidated financial statements, which could, in turn, subject us to securities class action litigation. Defending against such potential litigation relating to a restatement of our consolidated financial statements would be expensive and would require significant attention and resources of our management. Moreover, our insurance to cover our obligations with respect to the ultimate resolution of any such litigation may be inadequate. As a result of these factors, any such potential litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cause our stock price to decline, which could in turn subject us to securities class action litigation. Risks Related to Our Common Stock Our stock price is volatile and may fluctuate due to factors beyond our control. The market prices for and trading volumes of securities of biotechnology companies, including our securities, has historically been volatile. Our stock has had significant swings in trading prices, in particular in connection with our public communications regarding feedback received from regulatory authorities. For example, over the last twelve months, as of the date of this report, our stock has increased as much as 16% in a single day or decreased as much as 13% in a single day. The market has from time to time - 61 - experienced significant price and volume fluctuations unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors, including but not limited to: Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of a company’s stock, including ours, regardless of actual operating performance. For example, the trading prices of biopharmaceutical companies have been highly volatile as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation and increased interest rates and overall market volatility. In addition, our operations and performance may be affected by political or civil unrest or military action, including the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Additionally, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources. Our revenues and operating results could fluctuate significantly, which may adversely affect our stock price. Our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from year-to-year and quarter-to-quarter as well as in comparison to the corresponding quarter of the preceding year. Variations my result from one or more factors, including, without limitation: - 62 - In addition, in one or more future periods, our results of operations may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline. Provisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law might deter acquisition bids for us that might be considered favorable and prevent or frustrate any attempt to replace or remove the then-current management and board of directors. Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or effect a change in our board of directors and management. These provisions include: In addition, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws and in the Delaware General Corporation Law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by the then-current board of directors. - 63 - A significant number of shares of our common stock are issuable pursuant to outstanding stock awards, and we expect to issue additional stock awards and shares of common stock to attract and retain employees, directors and consultants. We may also issue shares of common stock to finance our operations and in connection with our strategic goals. Exercise of these awards and sales of shares will dilute the interests of existing security holders and may depress the price of our common stock. Currently, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 198.0 million shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2022, there were approximately 88.0 million shares of common stock outstanding and outstanding awards to purchase 11.0 million shares of common stock under various incentive stock plans. Additionally, as of December 31, 2022, there were approximately 4.9 million shares of common stock available for future issuance under our 2018 Equity Incentive Plan, approximately 0.2 million shares of common stock available for issuance under our Amended and Restated 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and approximately 0.8 million shares of common stock available for issuance under our 2014 Employment Commencement Incentive Plan. We may issue additional shares to grant equity awards to our employees, officers, directors and consultants under our 2018 Equity Incentive Plan, our 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan or our 2014 Employment Commencement Incentive Plan. We may also issue additional common stock and warrants from time to time to finance our operations and in connection with strategic transactions, such as acquisitions and licensing. For example, in February 2020, we issued and sold 2,522,227 shares of common stock to Roche Finance in connection with the entry into the collaboration agreement with Roche. The issuance of additional shares of common stock or warrants to purchase common stock and the perception that such issuances may occur or exercise of outstanding warrants or stock options may have a dilutive impact on other stockholders and could have a material negative effect on the market price of our common stock. Future sales of our common stock in the public market could cause our share price to fall. Sales of a substantial number of our common stock in the public market, including sales by members of our management or board of directors, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity or equity-related securities. Risks Related to Our Convertible Senior Notes Servicing our 1.50% notes due 2024 (the “2024 Notes”) and 1.25% notes due 2027 (the “2027 Notes”, and together with the 2024 Notes, the “Notes”) requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow to pay our debt. In 2017, we issued $570.0 million aggregate principal amount of Notes, pursuant to that certain indenture, dated as of November 14, 2019, between us, as issuer, and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. In September 2022, we issued $1,150.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2027 Notes, pursuant to that certain indenture dated as of September 16, 2022, between us, as issuer, and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, including $20.0 million of 2027 Notes issued to the Michael A. Chambers Living Trust in a private placement. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to many factors, including, economic, financial, competitive and other, beyond our control. We do not expect our business to be able to generate cash flow from operations in the foreseeable future, sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures and we may therefore be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance the 2024 Notes, which are non-callable and mature in 2024, and the 2027 Notes, which mature in 2027, will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such times. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations, and limit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business. - 64 - We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to repurchase the Notes as required upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to repurchase the Notes. Holders of the Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their Notes for cash upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. A fundamental change may also constitute an event of default or prepayment under, and result in the acceleration of the maturity of, our then-existing indebtedness. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient financial resources, or will be able to arrange financing, to pay the fundamental change repurchase price in cash with respect to any Notes surrendered by holders for repurchase upon a fundamental change. In addition, restrictions under our then existing credit facilities or other indebtedness, if any, may not allow us to repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change. Our failure to repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change when required would result in an event of default with respect to the Notes which could, in turn, constitute a default under the terms of our other indebtedness, if any. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Notes. Capped call transactions entered into in connection with the Notes may impact the value of our common stock. In connection with the Notes, we entered into capped call transactions (the “Capped Call Transactions”) with certain financial institutions. The Capped Call Transactions are expected to generally reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the Notes into shares of our common stock. In connection with establishing their initial hedges of the Capped Call Transactions, these financial institutions or their respective affiliates may have entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock and/or purchased our common stock. The financial institutions, or their respective affiliates, may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Notes. This activity may have an impact on the value of our common stock. General Risks Unfavorable global economic conditions could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our results of operations could be harmed by general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets. A severe or prolonged economic downturn, including the impact of increased interest rates and inflation (such as the recent rise in inflation in the United States), could result in a variety of risks to our business, including weakened demand for our product candidates and our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. A weak or declining economy could strain our manufacturers, possibly resulting in manufacturing disruption, or cause delays in payments for our services by third-party payors or our future collaborators. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the current economic climate and financial market conditions could harm our business. We may be subject to product liability claims and our insurance may not be adequate to cover damages. The current and future use of our product candidates by us and our collaborators in clinical trials, expanded access programs, the sale of our products, or the use of our products under emergency use vehicles may expose us to liability claims inherent to the manufacture, clinical testing, marketing and sale of medical products. These claims might be made directly by consumers or healthcare providers or indirectly by pharmaceutical companies, our collaborators or others selling such products. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, we may experience financial losses in the future due to such product liability claims. We have obtained commercial general liability insurance coverage for our clinical trials and the sale of commercial products. However, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against all losses. If a successful product liability claim or series of claims is brought against us for uninsured liabilities or in excess of insured liabilities, our assets may not be sufficient to cover such claims and our business operations could be impaired. If we succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for SRP-9001, sale of this gene therapy product candidate may decrease sales growth, or reduce sales, of our currently approved products, which could negatively impact our operating results, including through potential inventory write-offs. Substantial overlap may exist between the addressable patient population for SRP-9001, if approved, and the patient populations eligible for treatment with our existing commercialized products. SRP-9001, if approved, may be used in combination with our existing approved products or may be adopted as a separate treatment regimen. Accordingly, SRP-9001 and our other gene therapy product candidates, if approved, may compete with our current approved products. As a result, successful commercialization of our gene therapy product candidates, such as SRP-9001, may reduce sales of our currently approved products, potentially resulting in significant accounting charges relating to write-off of inventory if such inventory becomes obsolete or unusable. - 65 - Violation of the General Data Protection Regulation could subject us to significant fines. The GDPR increases our obligations with respect to clinical trials conducted in the member states of the EEA by expanding the definition of personal data to include coded data and requiring changes to informed consent practices and more detailed notices for clinical trial subjects and investigators. In addition, the GDPR increases the scrutiny that clinical trial sites located in the EEA should apply to transfers of personal data from such sites to countries that are considered to lack an adequate level of data protection, such as the U.S. The GDPR imposes substantial fines for breaches of data protection requirements, which can be up to four percent of global revenue or 20 million Euros, whichever is greater, and it also confers a private right of action on data subjects for breaches of data protection requirements. Compliance with these directives will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase our cost of doing business, and despite those efforts, there is a risk that we may be subject to fines and penalties, litigation and reputational harm in connection with our European activities. We have expanded, and may continue to expand, our organization and may experience difficulties in managing this growth, which could disrupt our operations. To support the expansion of our business activities, we have expanded, and may continue to expand, our full-time employee base, as well as our consultant and contractor base. Our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. Our ability to manage our growth properly and maintain compliance with all applicable rules and regulations will require us to continue to improve our operational, legal, financial and management controls, as well as our reporting systems and procedures. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Our growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of additional product candidates. If our management is unable to effectively manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate and/or grow revenues could be reduced, and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally. We are increasing our presence in international markets, including emerging markets, subjecting us to many risks that could adversely affect our business and revenues, such as: In addition, our international operations are subject to regulation under U.S. law. For example, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from paying, offering to pay, promising to pay or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to otherwise obtain favorable treatment or influence a person working in an official capacity. In many countries, the healthcare professionals we regularly interact with may meet the FCPA's definition of a foreign government official. Failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences, including: possible delay in approval or refusal to approve a product, recalls, seizures or withdrawal of an approved product from the market, disruption in the supply or availability of our products or suspension of export or import privileges, the imposition of civil or criminal - 66 - sanctions, the prosecution of executives overseeing our international operations and damage to our reputation. Any significant impairment of our ability to sell products outside of the U.S. could adversely impact our business and financial results. We rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology, including any cyber security incidents, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of the patients using our commercially approved products, clinical trial participants and employees. Similarly, our third-party providers possess certain of our sensitive data. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Our ongoing operating activities also depend on functioning computer systems. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure are subject to attacks or breaches. Any such breach could result in a material compromise of our networks, and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost, stolen, or rendered, permanently or temporarily, inaccessible. Furthermore, we may not promptly discover a system intrusion. Attacks could have a material impact on our business, operations or financial results. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information, including our data being breached at third party providers, could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt our operations and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business. We also may need to pay “ransomware” to re-access our systems. In addition, privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements, which increase the costs incurred by us in complying with such laws. The European Union’s GDPR, which greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of European Union law and became effective in May 2018, adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal data including the public disclosure of significant data breaches, and imposes substantial penalties for non-compliance of up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of global annual revenue for the preceding financial year. Our efforts to comply with GDPR and other privacy and data protection laws imposes significant costs and challenges that are likely to increase over time, and we are exposed to substantial penalties or litigation related to violations of existing or future data privacy laws and regulations. Additionally, the CCPA, which became effective January 1, 2020, substantially expands privacy obligations of many businesses. The CCPA requires new disclosures to California consumers, imposes new rules for collecting or using information about minors, and affords consumers new abilities, such as the right to know whether the data is sold or disclosed and to whom, the right to request that a company delete personal information collected, the right to opt-out of the sale of personal information and the right to non-discrimination in terms of price or service when a consumer exercises a privacy right. Failure to comply with these regulations is subject to civil sanctions, including fines and penalties. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. Moreover, a newly passed ballot initiative, the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which took effect on January 1, 2023, expands on the CCPA, creating new consumer rights and protections, including the right to correct personal information, the right to opt out of the use of personal information in automated decision making, the right to opt out of “sharing” consumer’s personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising, and the right to restrict use of and disclosure of sensitive personal information, including geolocation data to third parties. We will need to evaluate and potentially update our privacy program to seek to comply with the CPRA and will incur additional costs and expenses in our effort to comply. We may incur substantial costs in connection with litigation and other disputes. In the ordinary course of business we may, and in some cases have, become involved in lawsuits and other disputes such as securities claims, intellectual property challenges, including interferences declared by the USPTO, and employee matters. It is possible that we may not prevail in claims made against us in such disputes even after expending significant amounts of money and company resources in defending our positions in such lawsuits and disputes. The outcome of such lawsuits and disputes is inherently uncertain and may have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The increasing use of social media platforms presents new risks and challenges. Social media is increasingly being used to communicate about our products, technologies and programs, and the diseases our product and product candidates are designed to treat. Social media practices in the biopharmaceutical industry continue to evolve and regulations relating to such use are not always clear. This evolution creates uncertainty and risk of noncompliance with regulations applicable to our business. For example, patients may use social media channels to comment on the effectiveness of a product or to report an alleged adverse event. When such disclosures occur, there is a risk that we fail to monitor and comply with applicable adverse event reporting obligations or we may not be able to defend ourselves or the public's legitimate interests in the face of the political and market pressures generated by social media due to restrictions on what we may say about our product and/or product - 67 - candidates. There is also a risk of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information or negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us on any social networking website. If any of these events were to occur or we otherwise fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could incur liability, face overly restrictive regulatory actions or incur other harm to our business. We or the third parties upon whom we depend may be adversely affected by natural disasters and/or terrorism attacks, and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster. Natural disasters could severely disrupt our operations, and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. If a natural disaster, power outage, terrorism attack or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our office, manufacturing and/or lab spaces, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as the manufacturing facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place may prove inadequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Item 1B. Unr esol ved Staff Comments. None. - 68 - Item 2. Properties. A description of the facilities we own and/or occupy is included in the following table.

Overview We are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on helping patients through the discovery and development of unique RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene therapy and other genetic therapeutic modalities for the treatment of rare diseases. Applying our proprietary, highly-differentiated and innovative technologies, and through collaborations with our strategic partners, we have developed multiple approved products for the treatment of Duchenne and are developing potential therapeutic candidates for a broad range of diseases and disorders, including Duchenne, LGMDs, and other CNS related disorders. We commercialized three products, all of which were granted accelerated approval by the FDA: We are in the process of conducting various EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53 and AMONDYS 45 clinical trials, including studies that are required to comply with our post-marketing FDA requirements/commitments to verify and describe the clinical benefit of these products. A summary description of our key product candidates, including those in collaboration with our strategic partners, is as follows: - 71 - Our pipeline includes more than 40 programs in various stages of pre-clinical and clinical development, reflecting our multifaceted approach and expertise in precision genetic medicine to make a profound difference in the lives of patients suffering from rare diseases. We have developed proprietary state-of-the-art CMC and manufacturing capabilities that allow synthesis and purification of our products and product candidates to support both clinical development as well as commercialization. Our current main focus in manufacturing is to sustain large-scale production of our PMO-based therapies and optimizing manufacturing for PPMO and gene therapy-based product candidates. We have entered into certain manufacturing and supply arrangements with third-party suppliers and will utilize these capabilities to support production of certain of our products and product candidates and their components. In 2017, we opened a facility in Andover, Massachusetts, which significantly enhanced our research and development manufacturing capabilities. However, we currently do not have internal large scale GMP manufacturing capabilities to produce our products and product candidates for commercial and/or clinical use. The likelihood of our long-term success must be considered in light of the expenses, difficulties and delays frequently encountered in the development and commercialization of new pharmaceutical products, competitive factors in the marketplace and the complex regulatory environment in which we operate. We may never achieve significant revenue or profitable operations. COVID-19 Pandemic Despite careful tracking and planning, we are unable to accurately predict the extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations and financial condition due to the uncertainty of future developments. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19, the actions taken to contain it or treat its impact and the economic impact on local, regional, national and international markets. For additional information on the various risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. - 72 - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities for the periods presented. Some of these judgments can be subjective and complex, and, consequently, actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe that the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon historical experience and information available to us at the time that we make these estimates and judgments. To the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our consolidated financial statements will be affected. Although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate, actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Inventory Valuation Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. We capitalize inventory costs associated with products following regulatory approval when future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized. EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53 and AMONDYS 45 inventory that may be used in clinical development programs is charged to research and development expense when the product enters the research and development process and no longer can be used for commercial purposes. We periodically analyze our inventories for excess amounts or obsolescence and write down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value based on assumptions about expected future demand and market conditions. Additionally, though our products are subject to strict quality control and monitoring, which we perform throughout the manufacturing processes, certain batches or units of product may not meet quality specifications. Expense incurred related to excess inventory, obsolete inventory, or inventories that do not meet our quality specifications are recorded as a component of cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations. Income Tax We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon an examination. The calculation of our tax liabilities (or amount of reduction in our deferred tax assets from net operating loss carryover and research credit carryover) resulting from uncertain tax positions can involve significant judgment. Further, the calculation may involve the application of complex tax regulations in a foreign jurisdiction. Any significant impact as a result of changes in underlying facts, law, tax rates, tax audit, or review could lead to adjustments to our deferred tax asset, income tax expense, our effective tax rate, and/or our cash flow. Although we believe that we have adequately provided for tax liabilities resulting from uncertain tax positions, the actual amounts paid, if any, could have a material impact on our results of operations. Interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions are classified as a component of income tax expense. Stock-Based Compensation for Awards with Market Conditions We use the fair value method to determine stock-based compensation expense. The fair value for stock-based awards with market conditions is based on a lattice model with Monte Carlo simulations. The lattice model requires the use of subjective assumptions which include the award’s expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based compensation expense for awards with market conditions represent management’s best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, the use of different assumptions could result in materially different stock-based compensation expense. Please read Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates. - 73 - The following table sets forth selected consolidated statements of operations data for each of the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Change Change (in thousands, except per share amounts) $ % Revenues: Products, net $ 843,769 $ 612,401 $ 231,368 38 % Collaboration and other 89,244 89,486 (242 ) (— )% Total revenues 933,013 701,887 231,126 33 % Cost and expenses: Cost of sales (excluding amortization of in-licensed rights) 139,989 97,049 42,940 44 % Research and development 877,090 771,182 105,908 14 % Selling, general and administrative 451,421 282,660 168,761 60 % Settlement and license charges — 10,000 (10,000 ) (100 )% Amortization of in-licensed rights 714 706 8 1 % Total cost and expenses 1,469,214 1,161,597 307,617 26 % Operating loss (536,201 ) (459,710 ) (76,491 ) 17 % Other (loss) income, net: Loss on debt extinguishment (125,441 ) — (125,441 ) NM* Gain on contingent consideration, net 6,700 7,200 (500 ) (7 )% Gain from sale of Priority Review Voucher — 102,000 (102,000 ) (100 )% Other expense, net (35,021 ) (68,438 ) 33,417 (49 )% Total other (loss) income, net (153,762 ) 40,762 (194,524 ) NM* Loss before income tax expense (benefit) (689,963 ) (418,948 ) (271,015 ) 65 % Income tax expense (benefit) 13,525 (168 ) 13,693 NM* Net loss $ (703,488 ) $ (418,780 ) $ (284,708 ) 68 % Net loss per share — basic and diluted $ (8.03 ) $ (5.15 ) $ (2.88 ) 56 % * NM: not meaningful Revenues The following table summarizes the components of our net product revenues, by product, for the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Change Change (in thousands) $ % EXONDYS 51 $ 511,749 $ 454,361 $ 57,388 13 % AMONDYS 45 214,582 68,529 146,053 213 % VYONDYS 53 117,438 89,511 27,927 31 % Products, net $ 843,769 $ 612,401 $ 231,368 38 % Net product revenues for our products for 2022 increased by $231.4 million compared with 2021. The increase primarily reflects increasing demand for our products in the U.S. and a full period of AMONDYS 45 sales in 2022, given its commercial launch in February 2021. - 74 - Collaboration and other revenues primarily relate to our collaboration arrangement with Roche. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we recognized $89.2 million and $89.5 million of collaboration and other revenues, respectively. For more information, please read Note 3, License and Collaboration Agreements . Cost of sales (excluding amortization of in-licensed rights) Our cost of sales (excluding amortization of in-licensed rights) consists of royalty payments primarily to BioMarin and UWA and inventory costs that relate to sales of our products and the related overhead costs. Prior to receiving regulatory approval for EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53 and AMONDYS 45 by the FDA in September 2016, December 2019 and February 2021, respectively, we expensed such manufacturing and material costs as research and development expenses. For AMONDYS 45 sold in 2021, the majority of related manufacturing costs incurred had previously been expensed as research and development expenses, as such costs were incurred prior to the FDA approval of the product. For AMONDYS 45 sold in 2022 and EXONDYS 51 and VYONDYS 53 sold in 2021, only part of the related manufacturing costs incurred had previously been expensed as research and development expenses. If product related costs had not previously been expensed as research and development expenses prior to FDA approval, the incremental inventory costs related to our products sold in 2022 and 2021 would have been approximately $12.3 million and $22.0 million, respectively. The following table summarizes the components of our cost of sales for the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Change Change (in thousands) $ % Inventory costs related to products sold $ 95,765 $ 56,720 $ 39,045 69 % Royalty payments 44,224 40,329 3,895 10 % Total cost of sales $ 139,989 $ 97,049 $ 42,940 44 % The cost of sales (excluding amortization of in-licensed rights) for 2022 increased $42.9 million, or 44%, compared with 2021. The change primarily reflects increasing demand for our products and an increase in write-offs of certain batches of our products not meeting our quality specifications for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the same period of 2021. Research and development expenses Research and development expenses consist of costs associated with research activities as well as costs associated with our product development efforts, conducting pre-clinical trials, clinical trials and manufacturing activities. Direct research and development expenses associated with our programs include clinical trial site costs, clinical manufacturing costs, costs incurred for consultants, up-front fees and milestones paid to third parties in connection with technologies that have not reached technological feasibility and do not have an alternative future use, and other external services, such as data management and statistical analysis support, and materials and supplies used in support of clinical programs. Indirect costs of our clinical programs include salaries, stock-based compensation and allocation of our facility- and technology-related costs. Research and development expenses represent a substantial percentage of our total operating expenses. We do not maintain or evaluate and, therefore, do not allocate internal research and development costs on a project-by-project basis. As a result, a significant portion of our research and development expenses are not tracked on a project-by-project basis, as the costs may benefit multiple projects. - 75 - The following table summarizes our research and development expenses by project for each of the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Change Change (in thousands) $ % SRP-9001 $ 424,210 $ 320,214 $ 103,996 32 % Other gene therapies 81,783 102,036 (20,253 ) (20 )% PPMO platform 50,026 35,652 14,374 40 % Eteplirsen (exon 51) 46,100 36,464 9,636 26 % Up-front, milestone, and other expenses 35,102 40,267 (5,165 ) (13 )% Casimersen (exon 45) 31,850 34,443 (2,593 ) (8 )% Golodirsen (exon 53) 14,707 28,898 (14,191 ) (49 )% Collaboration cost-sharing 4,242 12,425 (8,183 ) (66 )% Other projects 12,321 17,302 (4,981 ) (29 )% Internal research and development expenses 294,021 233,704 60,317 26 % Roche collaboration reimbursement (117,272 ) (90,223 ) (27,049 ) 30 % Total research and development expenses $ 877,090 $ 771,182 $ 105,908 14 % The following table summarizes our research and development expenses by category for each of the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Change Change (in thousands) $ % Manufacturing expenses $ 445,758 $ 384,700 $ 61,058 16 % Compensation and other personnel expenses 148,385 115,394 32,991 29 % Clinical trial expenses 135,838 104,732 31,106 30 % Facility- and technology-related expenses 85,093 70,597 14,496 21 % Stock-based compensation 61,293 50,526 10,767 21 % Up-front, milestone, and other expenses 35,102 40,267 (5,165 ) (13 )% Professional services 19,264 13,900 5,364 39 % Pre-clinical expenses 8,704 21,410 (12,706 ) (59 )% Collaboration cost-sharing 4,242 12,425 (8,183 ) (66 )% Research and other 50,683 47,454 3,229 7 % Roche collaboration reimbursement (117,272 ) (90,223 ) (27,049 ) 30 % Total research and development expenses $ 877,090 $ 771,182 $ 105,908 14 % Research and development expenses for 2022 increased by $105.9 million, or 14%, compared with 2021. The increase was primarily driven by the following: - 76 - Selling, general and administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and related costs for personnel in our executive, finance, legal, information technology, business development, human resources, commercial and other general and administrative functions. Other general and administrative expenses include an allocation of our facility- and technology-related costs and professional fees for legal, consulting and accounting services. The following table summarizes our selling, general and administrative expenses by category for each of the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Change Change (in thousands) $ % Stock-based compensation $ 171,725 $ 63,417 $ 108,308 171 % Compensation and other personnel expenses 122,127 103,528 18,599 18 % Professional services 97,330 73,605 23,725 32 % Facility- and technology-related expenses 33,156 31,113 2,043 7 % Other 27,618 11,251 16,367 145 % Roche collaboration reimbursement (535 ) (254 ) (281 ) 111 % Total selling, general and administrative expenses $ 451,421 $ 282,660 $ 168,761 60 % Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2022 increased by $168.8 million, or 60%, compared with 2021. This was primarily driven by the following: Settlement and license charges In February 2021, we recognized a $10.0 million settlement charge related to contingent settlement payments to BioMarin as a result of the approval of AMONDYS 45 in the U.S. This was a result of a settlement and license agreement with BioMarin executed in July 2017. This amount, which was expensed to operations as incurred, is separately presented as settlement and license charges in the Company's consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2021. There was no such expense recognized during the same period of 2022. - 77 - Amortization of in-licensed rights Amortization of in-licensed rights relates to the agreements we entered into with BioMarin and UWA in July 2017 and April 2013, respectively. Each in-licensed right is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the patent from the first commercial sale of each product. For both the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded amortization of in-licensed rights of approximately $0.7 million. Loss on debt extinguishment On September 14, 2022, the Company entered into separate, privately negotiated transactions to repurchase a portion of the outstanding senior convertible notes due on November 15, 2024 (the “2024 Notes”) (see Note 13, Indebtedness ). The holders exchanged $150.6 million in aggregate principal value of 2024 Notes held by them plus accrued interest of $0.8 million for an aggregate payment of $248.6 million. The Company accounted for the repurchase of the 2024 Notes as a debt extinguishment by recognizing the difference between the repurchase price of the debt and the net carrying amount of the extinguished debt as loss on debt extinguishment. The loss incurred on the extinguishment was $98.5 million. On September 16, 2022, the Company repaid in full all of its amounts outstanding with respect to the December 13, 2019, term loan with Biopharma Credit PLC and Biopharma Credit Investments V (Master) LP (the ""December 2019 Term Loan"") and repaid in full all obligations to the lenders (see Note 13, Indebtedness ). The aggregate payoff amount was approximately $585.5 million, which included $550.0 million of principal amounts, additional loan consideration and premiums of $25.4 million, and accrued interest of $10.1 million through the repayment date. The loss incurred on the extinguishment was $26.9 million and represents the difference between the aggregate payoff amount and the net carrying amount of the December 2019 Term Loan. Gain on contingent consideration, net The gain on contingent consideration, net, relates to the fair value adjustment of the Company’s contingent consideration derivative liability related to regulatory-related contingent payments to Myonexus selling shareholders as well as to two academic institutions under separate license agreements that meet the definition of a derivative. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recognized net gains of $6.7 million and $7.2 million, respectively, to adjust the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities. For further information on our contingent considerations, please read Note 5, Fair Value Measurements. Gain from sale of Priority Review Voucher In February 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell the PRV we received from the FDA in connection with the approval of AMONDYS 45 (the ""AMONDYS 45 PRV""). Following the termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, in April 2021, we completed our sale of the AMONDYS 45 PRV and received proceeds of $102.0 million, with no commission costs, which was recorded as a gain from sale of the PRV as it did not have a carrying value at the time of the sale. Other expense, net Other expense, net primarily consists of interest expense on our debt facilities, interest income on our cash, cash equivalents and investments, amortization of investment premium or accretion of investment discount, and unrealized gain or loss from our investment in our strategic investments. Interest expense includes interest accrued on our convertible notes and term loan. Our cash equivalents and investments consist of money market funds, corporate bonds, commercial paper, government and government agency debt securities and certificates of deposit. Other expense, net for 2022 decreased by approximately $33.4 million compared with 2021. The decreases are primarily due to a $16.1 million increase in interest income and $11.1 million increase in accretion of investment discount due to the investment mix of our investment portfolio, as well as a $10.3 million reduction of interest expense incurred as a result of the repayment of our December 2019 Term Loan, partially offset by an increase of $4.9 million in losses on disposal of assets. Income tax expense (benefit) Income tax expense for 2022 was approximately $13.5 million and income tax benefit for 2021 was $0.2 million. Income tax expense (benefit) for all periods presented relates to state and foreign income taxes. Liquidity and Capital Resources On September 16, 2022, we issued $1,150.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due on September 15, 2027 (the “2027 Notes”). The 2027 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and bear interest at a rate of 1.25% per annum, payable semi-annually in cash on each March 15 and September 15, commencing on March 15, 2023. The net proceeds were $1,126.7 million after deducting the discounts and offering expenses of $23.3 million. The debt discount is amortized under the effective interest method and recorded as interest expense over the life of the 2027 Notes. - 78 - We used the net proceeds from the 2027 Notes offering as follows: We intend to use the remaining net proceeds to fund general corporate purposes. Refer to Note 13, Indebtedness and Note 19, Leases for additional discussion of our outstanding indebtedness and material changes to our leasing obligations, respectively. The following table summarizes our financial condition for each of the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Change Change (in thousands) $ % Financial assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 966,777 $ 2,115,869 $ (1,149,092 ) (54 )% Short-term investments 1,022,597 — 1,022,597 NM* Restricted cash and investments 19,024 9,904 9,120 92 % Total cash, cash equivalents and investments $ 2,008,398 $ 2,125,773 $ (117,375 ) (6 )% Borrowings: Convertible debt $ 1,544,292 $ 563,673 $ 980,619 174 % Term loan — 533,203 (533,203 ) (100 )% Total borrowings $ 1,544,292 $ 1,096,876 $ 447,416 41 % Working capital Current assets $ 2,557,861 $ 2,604,099 $ (46,238 ) (2 )% Current liabilities 619,604 452,733 166,871 37 % Total working capital $ 1,938,257 $ 2,151,366 $ (213,109 ) (10 )% * NM: not meaningful For the year ended December 31, 2022, our principal sources of liquidity were primarily derived from sales of our products, net proceeds from our 2027 Notes offering, and our collaboration arrangement with Roche. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our principal sources of liquidity were primarily derived from sales of our products, our collaboration arrangement with Roche, net proceeds from sale of the AMONDYS 45 PRV and net proceeds from our common stock offering in October 2021. Our principal uses of cash are research and development expenses, selling, general and administrative expenses, investments, capital expenditures, business development transactions, repayment of our term loan and a portion of our convertible debt and other working capital requirements. The changes in our working capital primarily reflect use of cash in operating activities. While our contractual obligations, commitments and debt service requirements over the next several years are significant, we intend to continue to fund our short-term financing needs and working capital requirements from cash flows of operating activities as well as cash on hand, and such sources are anticipated to be adequate to fund working capital requirements for at least twelve months from the date these consolidated financial statements were issued. Beyond 2023, our cash requirements will depend extensively on our ability to advance our research, development and commercialization of programs. We expect to seek additional financings primarily from, but not limited to, the sale and issuance of equity and debt securities, the licensing or sale of our technologies, additional government contracts and/or funded research and development agreements. Our future expenditures and long-term capital requirements may be substantial and will depend on many factors, including but not limited to the following: - 79 - We cannot provide assurances that financing will be available when and as needed or that, if available, the financings will be on favorable or acceptable terms. If we are unable to obtain additional financing when and if we require, this would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. To the extent we issue additional equity securities, our existing stockholders could experience substantial dilution. We have entered into long-term contractual arrangements from time to time for our facilities, the provision of goods and services, and issuance of debt securities, among others. As of December 31, 2022, total obligations under debt, lease, and manufacturing arrangements were $1,653.8 million, $62.9 million, and $1,385.8 million, respectively, with $20.6 million, $14.6 million and $649.6 million due in less than one year, and approximately $1,633.2 million, $48.3 million and $736.1 million due in greater than one year. Interest payments are included within the future debt obligations stated in the previous sentence. Lease obligations only include real estate leases that had commenced prior to December 31, 2022. The leases embedded in certain supply agreements are included in manufacturing obligations. Additional information regarding our obligations under debt, lease, and manufacturing arrangements is provided in Note 13, Indebtedness, Note 19, Leases and Note 21, Commitments and Contingencies , respectively, to the consolidated financial statements. For products and product candidates that are currently in various research and development stages, we may be obligated to make up to $3.2 billion of future development, regulatory, up-front royalty and sales milestone payments associated with our collaboration and license agreements. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable upon achievement of certain development, regulatory or commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones is not probable and payment is not required as of December 31, 2022, such contingencies have not been recorded in our consolidated financial statements. Amounts related to contingent milestone payments are not yet considered contractual obligations as they are contingent on the successful achievement of certain development, regulatory approval and commercial milestones.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Please read Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualita tive Disclosures About Market Risk. Our current investment policy is to maintain a diversified investment portfolio consisting of money market investments, commercial paper, government and government agency bonds and high-grade corporate bonds with maturities of 36 months or less. Our cash is primarily deposited in and invested through highly rated financial institutions in the U.S. As of December 31, 2022, we had $2,008.4 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments, comprised of $1,022.6 million of short-term investments, $966.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and $19.0 million of long-term restricted cash. The Company only holds debt securities classified as available-for-sale. The fair value of cash equivalents and short-term investments is subject to change as a result of potential changes in market interest rates. The potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments has been assessed on a hypothetical 10 basis point adverse movement across all maturities. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we estimate that such hypothetical adverse 10 basis point movement would result in a hypothetical loss in fair value of approximately $0.4 million to our interest rate sensitive instruments. The Company did not hold any investments in interest rate sensitive instruments as of December 31, 2021. Our $1,150.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 2027 Notes has a fixed interest rate of 1.25% per annum, payable semi-annually in cash on each March 15 and September 15 and our $419.4 million aggregate principal amount of our 2024 Notes has a fixed interest rate of 1.5% per annum, payable semi-annually in cash on each May 15 and November 15, and therefore are not subject to fluctuations in market interest rates.

Changes in and Disagreements with Acc ountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. None. Item 9A. Control s and Procedures. Disclosure Controls and Procedures We carried out an evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to paragraph (b) of Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Based on that review, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act (1) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and (2) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control procedure, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control procedure are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. We considered these limitations during the development of our disclosure controls and procedures, and will continually reevaluate them to ensure they provide reasonable assurance that such controls and procedures are effective. Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for our Company, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that: Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in its 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on this assessment, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have not been material changes in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a–15(f) and 15d–15(f) under the Exchange Act for the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that our certifying officers concluded materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. - 83 - Item 9B.

We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for convertible debt as of January 1, 2021 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2020-06, Debt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity. Basis for Opinions The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in F- 2 accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Evaluation of lower of cost or net realizable value of raw materials inventory As described in Note 2 and Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, approximately 16%, or $59.2 million, of the Company’s total inventory balance is comprised of raw materials. As discussed in Note 2, the Company periodically analyzes its raw materials inventories, and writes down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value. We identified the evaluation of lower of cost or net realizable value of raw materials inventory as a critical audit matter. The estimate of expected future demand for raw materials inventory is difficult to assess and results in the application of greater auditor judgment. Specifically, challenging auditor judgment was required to assess the potential impact the Company’s gene therapy technologies and competitor RNA-targeted therapeutic or gene therapy products could have on existing raw materials inventory. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s inventory valuation process, including controls related to the estimate of expected future demand for raw materials. We compared the Company’s prior period forecasted demand for raw materials to actual results to assess their ability to accurately estimate expected future demand. We evaluated clinical progress associated with the Company’s gene therapy technologies by inspecting internal meeting minutes and interviewing research and development personnel of the Company and assessed the potential impact of those technologies on expected future demand for raw materials inventory. We also read publicly available information to identify information regarding other competitor entities with RNA-targeted therapeutic or gene therapy products that could impact the Company’s estimates of expected future demand. /s/ KPMG LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002.

F- 7 Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, “Sarepta” or the “Company”) is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on helping patients through the discovery and development of unique RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene therapy and other genetic therapeutic modalities for the treatment of rare diseases. Applying its proprietary, highly-differentiated and innovative technologies, and through collaborations with its strategic partners, the Company has developed multiple approved products for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (“Duchenne”) and is developing potential therapeutic candidates for a broad range of diseases and disorders, including Duchenne, Limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (“LGMDs”) and other neuromuscular and central nervous system (“CNS”) disorders. The Company's products in the U.S., EXONDYS 51 (eteplirsen) Injection (“EXONDYS 51”), VYONDYS 53 (golodirsen) Injection (“VYONDYS 53”) and AMONDYS 45 (casimersen) Injection (“AMONDYS 45”), were granted accelerated approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) on September 19, 2016, December 12, 2019 and February 25, 2021, respectively. Indicated for the treatment of Duchenne in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene that is amenable to exon 51, exon 53 and exon 45 skipping, respectively, EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53 and AMONDYS 45 use the Company’s phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (“PMO”) chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 51, exon 53 and exon 45 of the dystrophin gene. Exon skipping is intended to promote the production of an internally truncated but functional dystrophin protein. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately $ 2,008.4 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments, consisting of $ 1,022.6 million of short-term investments, $ 966.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and $ 19.0 million of long-term restricted cash. The Company believes that its balance of cash, cash equivalents and investments as of December 31, 2022 is sufficient to fund its current operational plan for at least the next twelve months, though it may pursue additional cash resources through public or private debt and equity financings, seek funded research and development arrangements and additional government contracts and establish collaborations with or license its technology to other companies. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”), reflect the accounts of Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions between and among its consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated. Management has determined that the Company operates in one segment: discovering, developing, manufacturing and delivering therapies to patients with rare diseases. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer, as the chief operating decision-maker, manages and allocates resources to the operations of the Company on a total company basis. The Company’s research and development organization is responsible for the research and discovery of new product candidates and supports development and registration efforts for potential future products. The Company’s supply chain organization manages the development of the manufacturing processes, clinical trial supply and commercial product supply. The Company’s commercial organization is responsible for commercialization of EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53 and AMONDYS 45 in the U.S. and internationally. The Company is supported by other back-office general and administration functions. Consistent with this decision-making process, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer uses consolidated, single-segment financial information for purposes of evaluating performance, forecasting future period financial results, allocating resources and setting incentive targets. In the opinion of the Company’s management, all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair presentation have been reflected. Estimates and Uncertainties The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. F- 8 Fair Value Measurements The Company has certain financial assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value which have been classified as Level 1, 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy as described in the accounting standards for fair value measurements: The fair value of the majority of the Company’s financial assets are categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. These assets include commercial paper, government and government agency bonds, corporate bonds and certificates of deposit. For additional information related to fair value measurements, please read Note 5, Fair Value Measurements to the consolidated financial statements. Cash Equivalents Only investments that are highly liquid and readily convertible to cash and have original maturities of three months or less are considered cash equivalents. Investments Available-For-Sale Debt Securities Available-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholder’s equity. Interest income and realized gains and losses are reported in other expense, net, on a specific identification basis. Equity Investments The Company’s equity investments include its investments in a publicly traded biotechnology company and several privately held biotechnology companies and are included in other non-current assets in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The equity investment in the publicly traded biotechnology company has a readily determinable fair value and is carried at fair value. The equity investments in the privately held biotechnology companies do not have readily determinable fair values and are measured at cost less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Any change in the valuation of equity investments is recorded as a gain or loss on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Accounts Receivable The Company’s accounts receivable primarily arise from product sales. They are generally stated at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Revenues from product sales are recorded at the net sales price (transaction price), which includes estimates of variable consideration for which reserves are established and which result from Medicaid rebates, governmental chargebacks including Public Health Services (“PHS”) chargebacks, prompt pay discounts, co-pay assistance and distribution fees. These reserves are based on the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if no payments are required of the Company) for PHS chargebacks, prompt pay discounts and certain distribution fees, or a current liability (if a payment is required of the Company) for Medicaid rebates, co-pay assistance and certain distribution fees. The accounts receivable from product sales represents receivables due from the Company’s specialty distributor and specialty pharmacies in the U.S. as well as certain distributors in the European Union (“EU”) , Brazil, Israel and the Middle East. The Company has had no historical write-offs of its accounts receivable and its payment terms range from 60 to 91 days for sales within the U.S. and 45 and 150 days for the majority of product sales outside the U.S. The Company monitors the financial performance and creditworthiness of its customers so that it can properly assess and respond to changes in the customers’ credit profiles or any specific issues. The Company provides reserves against trade receivables for expected credit losses that may result from a customer’s inability to pay. Amounts determined to be uncollectible are written-off against the established reserve. As of December 31, 2022 , the credit profiles for the Company’s customers are deemed to be in good standing and an allowance for credit losses is not considered necessary. F- 9 Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and accounts receivable from customers. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s cash was concentrated at three financial institutions, which potentially exposes the Company to credit risks. However, the Company does not believe that there is significant risk of non-performance by the financial institutions. Please refer to Note 7, Product Revenues, Net, Accounts Receivable and Reserves for Product Revenues for discussion of the credit risk associated with accounts receivable from customers. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. The Company capitalizes inventory costs associated with products following regulatory approval when future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized. EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53 and AMONDYS 45 inventory used in clinical development programs is charged to research and development expense when the product enters the research and development process and no longer can be used for commercial purposes. The Company periodically analyzes its inventories for excess amounts or obsolescence and writes down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value. Additionally, though the Company’s products are subject to strict quality control and monitoring which the Company performs throughout the manufacturing processes, certain batches or units of product may not meet quality specifications. Expense incurred related to excess inventory, obsolete inventory, or inventories that do not meet the Company's quality specifications are recorded as a component of cost of sales in the Company's consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. For products which are under development and have not yet been approved by regulatory authorities, purchased drug product is charged to research and development expense upon delivery. Delivery occurs when the inventory passes quality inspection and ownership transfers to the Company. Nonrefundable advance payments for research and development activities, including production of purchased drug product, are deferred and capitalized until the goods are delivered. If the Company does not expect the goods to be delivered or services to be rendered, the advanced payment capitalized will be charged to expense. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are initially recorded at cost, including the acquisition cost and all costs necessarily incurred to bring the asset to the location and working condition necessary for their intended use. The cost of normal, recurring or periodic repairs and maintenance activities related to property and equipment are expensed as incurred. The cost for planned major maintenance activities, including the related acquisition or construction of assets, is capitalized if the repair will result in future economic benefits. Interest costs incurred during the construction period of major capital projects are periodically reviewed, and if determined to be material, capitalized until the asset is ready for its intended use, at which point the interest costs are amortized as depreciation expense over the life of the underlying asset. The Company generally depreciates the cost of its property and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which are summarized as follows: Asset Category Useful lives Lab and manufacturing equipment 5 years Office equipment 5 years Software and computer equipment 3 - 5 years Furniture and fixtures 7 years Leasehold improvements Lesser of the useful life or the term of the respective lease Land improvements 25 years Land Not depreciated Building and improvements 30 years Construction in progress Not depreciated until put into service F- 10 Intangible assets The Company’s intangible assets consist of in-licensed rights, patent costs and software licenses, which are stated in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, net of accumulated amortization and impairments, if applicable. The in-licensed rights primarily relate to agreements with BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. (“BioMarin”) and the University of Western Australia (“UWA”). The in-licensed rights are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the related patents because the life of the related patents reflects the expected time period that the Company will benefit from the in-licensed rights. Patent costs consist primarily of external legal costs, filing fees incurred to file patent applications and renewal fees on proprietary technology developed or licensed by the Company. Patent costs associated with applying for a patent, being issued a patent and annual renewal fees are capitalized. Costs to defend a patent and costs to invalidate a competitor’s patent or patent application are expensed as incurred. Patent costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated economic lives or the initial term of the patents, which is generally 20 years. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets held and used by the Company, intangible assets with definite lives and right of use (“ROU”) assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. The Company evaluates recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Such reviews assess the fair value of the assets based upon estimates of future cash flows that the assets are expected to generate. Convertible Debt As a result of adopting ASU 2020-06, “ Debt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity ”, the Company accounts for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments that can be settled in cash as a single liability measured at its amortized cost, as long as no other features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). Simultaneously with the issuance of the Company's convertible senior notes due on November 15, 2024 (the ""2024 Notes"") and convertible senior notes due on September 15, 2027 (the ""2027 Notes"") in November 2017 and September 2022, respectively, the Company bought capped call options from certain counterparties to minimize the impact of potential dilution upon conversion. The premium for the capped call options was recorded as additional paid-in capital. For additional information related to the convertible debt transactions, please read Note 13, Indebtedness to the consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for the goods or services provided. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements within the scope of ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), the Company performs the following five steps: (1) identify the contract with the customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers or provides to the customer. At contract inception, the Company assesses the goods or services promised within each contract and determines those that are performance obligations, and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. The Company then recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when or as the performance obligation is satisfied. The only performance obligation in the Company’s contracts with customers is to timely deliver drug products to the customer’s designated location. Product revenues The Company distributes its products principally through its customers. The customers subsequently resell the products to patients and health care providers. The Company provides no right of return to the customers except in cases of shipping error or product defect. Product revenues are recognized when the customers take control of the products, which typically occurs upon F- 11 delivery to the customers. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the majority of the product revenues recognized were generated by the specialty distributor and specialty pharmacies in the U.S. Variable Consideration Product revenues are recorded at the net sales price (transaction price) which includes estimated reserves for variable consideration, such as Medicaid rebates, governmental chargebacks, including PHS chargebacks, prompt payment discounts, co-pay assistance and distribution fees. These reserves reflect the Company’s best estimates of the amount of consideration to which it is entitled based on the terms of the contracts. Additional details relating to variable consideration follows: Collaboration revenue The Company’s collaboration revenue is primarily generated from its collaboration arrangement with F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd. (“Roche”). For more information, please read Note 3, License and Collaboration Agreements . At the inception of a collaboration arrangement, the Company first assesses whether the contractual arrangement is within the scope of ASC Topic 808, Collaborative Arrangements (“ASC 808”) to determine whether the arrangement involves a joint operating activity and involves two (or more) parties that are both active participants in the activity and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of such activity. Then the Company determines whether the collaboration arrangement in its entirety represents a contract with a customer as defined by ASC 606. If only a portion of the collaboration arrangement is potentially with a customer, the Company applies the distinct good or service unit-of-account guidance in ASC 606 to determine whether there is a unit of account that should be accounted for under ASC 606. For the units of account in the collaboration arrangement that do not represent a vendor-customer relationship, the Company will (i) consider applying other GAAP, including by analogy, or (ii) if there is no appropriate analogy, consistently apply a reasonable and rational accounting policy election. In general, by analogy to ASC 606, the Company identifies the performance obligations within the collaboration arrangement and identifies and allocates the transaction price the Company expects to receive on a relative standalone selling price basis to each performance obligation. Variable consideration, consisting of development and regulatory milestones, will be included in the transaction price only if the Company expects to receive such consideration and if it is probable that the inclusion of the variable consideration will not result in a significant reversal in the cumulative amount of revenue recognized under the arrangement. Sales-based royalty and milestone payments are excluded from the transaction price the Company expects to receive until the underlying sales occur because the license to the Company’s intellectual property is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties or milestones relate as it is the primary driver of value in its collaboration arrangement. F- 12 For the recognition of revenue associated with each performance obligation, if the Company determines ASC 606 is not appropriate to apply by analogy, the Company will apply a reasonable, rational and consistently applied accounting policy election to faithfully depict the transfer of services to the collaboration partner over the estimated performance period. Up-front payments from a collaboration partner are recognized as deferred revenue when received and recognized as revenue over the estimated performance period. Reimbursement payments from a collaboration partner associated with cost-sharing provisions in a collaboration arrangement are recognized as the related expense is incurred and classified as an offset to operating expenses. Valuation of Product Options The Company's collaboration arrangements may contain options which provide the collaboration partner with the right to obtain additional licenses. If an arrangement contains product options, by analogy to ASC 606, the Company evaluates the product options to determine whether they represent material rights, which may include options to acquire additional goods or services for free or at a discount. If the customer options are determined to represent material rights, they are recognized as a separate performance obligation at inception of the arrangement. The Company allocates a portion of the transaction price of the collaboration arrangement to material rights based on the relative standalone selling price. Amounts allocated to material rights are not recognized as revenue until related options are exercised or expire. Key assumptions to determine the standalone selling price of product options in a collaboration arrangement include, but are not limited to, forecasted revenues, development timelines, incremental costs related to the arrangement, discount rates and likelihood of technical and regulatory success. Research and Development Research and development expenses consist of costs associated with research activities as well as those with the Company’s product development efforts, conducting pre-clinical trials, clinical trials and manufacturing activities. Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred. Up-front fees and milestones paid to third parties in connection with technologies which have not reached technological feasibility and do not have an alternative future use are expensed when incurred. Direct research and development expenses associated with the Company’s programs include clinical trial site costs, clinical manufacturing costs, costs incurred for consultants and other external services, such as data management and statistical analysis support and materials and supplies used in support of clinical programs. Indirect costs of the Company’s clinical programs include salaries, stock-based compensation and an allocation of its facility and technology costs. When third-party service providers’ billing terms do not coincide with the Company’s period-end, the Company is required to make estimates of its obligations to those third parties, including clinical trial and pharmaceutical development costs, contractual services costs and costs for supply of its drug candidates, incurred in a given accounting period and record accruals at the end of the period. The Company bases its estimates on its knowledge of the research and development programs, services performed for the period, past history for related activities and the expected duration of the third-party service contract, where applicable. Stock-Based Compensatio n The Company’s stock-based compensation programs include stock options, restricted stock awards (“RSAs”), restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and an employee stock purchase program (“ESPP”). The Company accounts for stock-based compensation using the fair value method. The fair value of stock options are estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The fair values of RSAs and RSUs are based on the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant. The fair value of stock awards, with consideration given to estimated forfeitures, is recognized as stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the grants. For stock awards with performance-vesting conditions, the Company does not recognize compensation expense until it is probable that the performance-vesting condition will be achieved. Additionally, the Company granted its Chief Executive Officer options with service and market conditions. A market condition relates to the achievement of a specified price of the Company’s common stock, a specified amount of intrinsic value indexed to the Company’s common stock or a specified price of the Company’s common stock in terms of other similar equity shares. The grant date fair value for the options with service and market conditions is determined by a lattice model with Monte Carlo simulations and is recognized as stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period. Under the Company’s ESPP, participating employees purchase common stock through payroll deductions. The purchase price is equal to 85 % of the lower of the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the first business day and the last business day of the relevant purchase period. The fair value of stock purchase rights is estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The fair value of the look-back provision with the 15 % discount is recognized on a graded-vesting basis as stock-based compensation expense over the purchase period. F- 13 Income Taxes The Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the net deferred tax asset to zero when it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon an examination. The amount of the benefit that may be recognized in the financial statements is the largest amount that has a greater than 50 % likelihood of being realized. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions within income tax expense. It is the intention of the Company to reinvest the earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries in those operations and not to repatriate the earnings to the U.S. Accordingly, the Company does not provide for deferred taxes on the excess of the financial reporting over the tax basis in its investments in foreign subsidiaries as they are considered permanent in duration. Leases At the inception of an arrangement, the Company determines whether the arrangement is or contains a lease based on the unique facts and circumstances present in the arrangement. Leases with a term greater than 12 months are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and short-term and long-term lease liabilities, as applicable. The Company has elected not to recognize leases with terms of 12 months or less on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company typically only includes an initial lease term in its assessment of a lease arrangement. Options to renew a lease are not included in the Company’s assessment unless there is reasonable certainty that the Company will renew. The Company monitors its plans to renew its leases no less than on a quarterly basis. In addition, the Company’s lease agreements generally do not contain any residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants. Operating lease liabilities and their corresponding ROU assets are recorded based on the present value of future lease payments over the expected remaining lease term at lease commencement. The initial measurement of the lease liability is determined based on the future lease payments, which may include lease payments that depend on an index or a rate (such as the consumer price index or other market index). The Company initially measures payments based on an index or rate by using the applicable rate at lease commencement and subsequent changes in such rates are recognized as variable lease costs. Variable payments that do not depend on a rate or index are not included in the lease liability and are recognized as they are incurred. Lease costs for operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as an operating expense with unrecognized variable lease payments recognized as incurred. Certain adjustments to the ROU asset may be required for items such as lease prepayments or incentives received. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable. As a result, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate, which reflects the fixed rate at which the Company could borrow on a collateralized basis the amount of the lease payments in the same currency, for a similar term, in a similar economic environment. Components of a lease are bifurcated between lease components and non-lease components. The fixed and in-substance fixed contract consideration identified is then allocated based on the relative standalone price to the lease and non-lease components. However, ASC Topic 842, Leases, provides entities with a practical expedient that allows an accounting policy election to not separate lease and non-lease components by class of underlying asset. In using this expedient, entities would account for each lease component and the related non-lease component together as a single component. For new and amended real estate leases beginning after January 1, 2019, the Company elected to account for the lease and non-lease components together for existing classes of underlying assets and allocates the contract consideration to the lease component only. In contrast, the Company does not apply the practical expedient for leases embedded in manufacturing and supply agreements with certain of its contract manufacturing organizations and has instead allocated contract consideration between the lease and non-lease components based on their relative standalone price. Embedded Derivatives The Company evaluates certain of its financial and business development transactions to determine if embedded components of these contracts meet the definition of derivative under ASC 815. In general, embedded derivatives are required to be bifurcated from the host instrument if (i) the embedded feature is not clearly and closely related to the host contract and (ii) the embedded feature, if considered a freestanding instrument, meets the definition of a derivative. The embedded derivative is reported on the consolidated balance sheets at its fair value. Any change in fair value, as determined at each measurement period, is recorded as a component of the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. F- 14 Contingent Consideration Certain of the Company’s license and collaboration agreements include future payments that are contingent upon the receipt, or receipt and subsequent sale, of a Priority Review Voucher (“PRV”) . The Company has concluded that these contingent payments represent embedded derivatives. The Company records a liability for such contingent payments at fair value on the date the agreements are effective. The Company estimates the fair value of contingent consideration derivatives through a valuation model that includes an income approach based on the probability-weighted expected cash flows that incorporated industry-based probability adjusted assumptions relating to the achievement of the milestone and thus the likelihood of making the payments. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration derivatives can result from changes to one or multiple assumptions, including adjustments to the discount rates, the assumed development timeline and the probability of achievement of certain regulatory milestones. The Company revalues its contingent consideration derivatives upon a material change to one or more of the assumptions discussed above. Changes in the fair value of the Company’s contingent consideration derivatives are recognized in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Such changes are classified as other income (loss), which corresponds to the classification of any gain recognized upon the actual sale of a PRV. Commitments and Contingencies The Company records liabilities for legal and other contingencies when information available to the Company indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Legal costs in connection with legal and other contingencies are expensed as costs are incurred. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Recently adopted In August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2020-06, “ Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity .” This ASU simplifies the complexity associated with applying U.S. GAAP for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity. More specifically, the amendments focus on the guidance for convertible instruments and derivative scope exceptions for contracts in an entity’s own equity. Under ASU 2020-06, the embedded conversion features are no longer separated from the host contract for convertible instruments with conversion features that are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under ASC 815, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital. Consequently, a convertible debt instrument, such as the 2024 Notes or the 2027 Notes, will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost, as long as no other features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives. The new guidance also requires the if-converted method to be applied for all convertible instruments and requires additional disclosures. The Company elected to early adopt this guidance on January 1, 2021, using the modified retrospective method. U nder this transition method, the cumulative effect of the accounting change removed the impact of recognizing the equity component of the Company’s convertible notes (at issuance and the subsequent accounting impact of additional interest expense from debt discount amortization). The cumulative effect of the accounting change as of January 1, 2021 increased the carrying amount of the convertible notes by $ 96.8 million, reduced accumulated deficit by $ 60.2 million and reduced additional paid-in capital by $ 157.0 million. Interest expense of the 2024 Notes will be lower as a result of adoption of this guidance. The if-converted method for such instruments will be used to compute diluted net earnings per share if and when profitability is achieved. 3. LICENSE AND COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd. On December 21, 2019, the Company entered into a license, collaboration and option agreement with Roche and a stock purchase agreement (the “Roche Agreement”) with Roche, providing Roche with exclusive commercial rights to SRP-9001, the Company’s investigational gene therapy for Duchenne, outside the U.S. The Company retains all rights to SRP-9001 in the U.S. and will perform all development activities within the joint global development plan necessary to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for SRP-9001 in the U.S. and the EU, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. Further: (i) research and development expenses incurred under the joint global development plan will be equally shared between the Company and Roche, (ii) Roche is solely responsible for all costs incurred in connection with any development activities (other than those within the joint global development plan) that are necessary to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals outside the U.S, and (iii) the Company will continue to be responsible for the manufacturing of clinical and commercial supplies of SRP-9001. The Company has also granted Roche options to acquire ex-U.S. rights to certain future Duchenne-specific programs (the “Options”) in exchange for separate option exercise payments, milestone and royalty considerations, and cost-sharing provisions. The agreement became effective on February 4, 2020. The Roche Agreement is governed by a joint steering committee (“JSC”) formed by representatives from Roche and the Company. F- 15 The JSC, among other activities, manages the overall strategic alignment between the parties, approves any material update to the joint global development plan and budget and oversees the operations of the subcommittees. The Company received an aggregate of approximately $ 1.2 billion in cash consideration from Roche, consisting of an up-front payment and an equity investment in the Company. The Company may receive up to $ 1.7 billion in development, regulatory and sales milestones related to SRP-9001. Upon commercialization, the Company is also eligible to receive tiered royalty payments on net sales based on the average cost to manufacture SRP-9001 . Of the $1.2 billion cash received from Roche, (i) $ 312.1 million, net of issuance costs, was allocated to the approximately 2.5 million shares of the Company’s common stock issued to Roche based on the closing price when the shares were issued, (ii) $ 485.0 million was allocated to the Options, and (iii) $ 348.7 million was allocated to a single, combined performance obligation (“Combined Performance Obligation”) comprised of: (i) the license of IP relating to SRP-9001 transferred to Roche, (ii) the related research and development services provided under the joint global development plan, (iii) the services provided to manufacture clinical supplies of SRP-9001, and (iv) the Company’s participation in the JSC, because the Company determined that the license of IP and related activities were not capable of being distinct from one another. The value assigned to the Options is reflected as deferred revenue and will not be recognized until an option is either: (i) exercised by Roche, or (ii) expires. If exercised, the value will be aggregated with the option exercise price and recognized over the applicable performance period. If expired, the value will be recognized immediately. The Company recognizes revenue related to the Combined Performance Obligation on a straight-line basis over the expected performance period of the joint global development plan, which is expected to extend through the fourth quarter of 2023. Revenue relating to future development, regulatory and sales milestones will be recognized when the milestone is probable of achievement (which is typically when the milestone has occurred). Any royalties payable by Roche in the future will be recognized in the period earned. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized $ 89.2 million, $ 89.5 million and $ 84.2 million of collaboration and other revenues, respectively, the majority of which relates to the Combined Performance Obligation. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has total deferred revenue of $ 574.2 million associated with the Roche Agreement, of which $ 89.2 million is classified as current. Through 2022, no Options were exercised or expired. As such, deferred revenue related to the separate material rights for the Options remained unchanged at $ 485.0 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. The costs associated with co-development activities performed under the Roche Agreement are included in operating expenses, with any reimbursement of costs by Roche reflected as a reduction of such expenses when the related expense is incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, costs reimbursable by Roche and reflected as a reduction to operating expenses were $ 117.8 million, $ 90.5 million and $ 66.5 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, there was $ 41.8 million of collaboration receivable included in other current assets. Genethon The Company entered into a sponsored research agreement in May 2017 and subsequently entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Genethon in November 2019 (the “Genethon Collaboration Agreement”) for Genethon’s micro-dystrophin gene therapy program for the treatment of Duchenne. The Genethon Collaboration Agreement grants the Company with exclusive rights in the majority of the world (primarily excluding the EU) to Genethon’s micro-dystrophin gene therapy products (“Genethon Products”) and other micro-dystrophin gene therapy products (“Other Licensed Products”). The Company may be liable for up to $ 157.5 million and $ 78.8 million in development, regulatory and sales milestones for the Genethon Products and Other Licensed Products, respectively. Furthermore, upon commercialization, the Company will be required to make tiered royalty payments based on net sales of the Genethon Products and the Other Licensed Products. Under the Genethon Collaboration Agreement, a joint steering committee was established to plan, monitor and coordinate development activities for Genethon Products and Other Licensed Products. The Company and Genethon are responsible for 75 % and 25 %, respectively, of development costs related to both the Genethon Products and the Other Licensed Products. Upon signing the Genethon Collaboration Agreement, the Company made an up-front payment of $ 28.0 million, which was recorded as research and development expense in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2019. Additionally, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded $ 3.5 million , $ 11.7 million and $ 10.1 million, respectively, of research and development expense related to reimbursable development costs incurred by Genethon for Genethon Products.

In November 2019, the Company entered into a collaboration and license agreement and a stock purchase agreement (collectively, the “StrideBio Agreements”) with StrideBio, Inc. (“StrideBio”). The StrideBio Agreements grant the Company F- 16 exclusive worldwide licenses to develop, collaborate and commercialize StrideBio’s adeno-associated viral capsids for gene therapies with respect to multiple development targets, to which the Company will have the exclusive right to perform development activities (“Sarepta Development Targets”) and targets that the two parties will jointly develop through completion of Phase 1/2 clinical trials (“Joint Development Targets”). For Sarepta Development Targets and Joint Development Targets, respectively, the Company may be liable for up to $ 450.0 million and $ 835.0 million in development, regulatory and sales milestone payments per target. Additionally, upon commercialization, the Company may be required to make tiered royalty payments based on net sales of each target. Upon signing the StrideBio Agreements, the Company made an up-front payment of $ 46.9 million, consisting of a cash payment of $ 17.5 million and 301,980 shares of the Company’s common stock delivered to StrideBio with a fair value of $ 29.4 million. The up-front payment was recorded as research and development expense in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2019. In November 2022, the Company amended the collaboration and license agreement with StrideBio (the ""StrideBio Amendment"") such that all research activities with respect to the Joint Development Targets were assumed by the Company. This amendment resulted in the elimination of all future development, regulatory and sales milestone obligations. For the year ended December 31, 2022, no develop ment or regulatory milestones were deemed probable of being achieved and, accordingly, no additional expense has been recognized. In March 2021, the Company participated in StrideBio’s Series B round of financing and purchased approximately 0.2 million shares of preferred stock, for cash consideration of $ 1.8 million. In August 2022, the Company purchased unsecured convertible promissory notes and warrants through a rights offering with StrideBio for cash consideration of $ 0.2 million. As a result of the StrideBio Amendment and the Company’s assessment of the fair value of the securities it held in StrideBio, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $ 2.0 million related to the equity investment in StrideBio’s Series B preferred stock and convertible promissory notes and warrants during the year ended December 31, 2022. Please read Note 5, Fair Value Measurements for further information. Myonexus Therapeutics Inc. In April 2019, the Company completed its acquisition of Myonexus Therapeutics, Inc. (“Myonexus”), a clinical-stage gene therapy biotechnology company that was developing gene therapies for LGMD for $ 178.3 million. The Company may also be required to make up to $ 200.0 million in additional payments to selling shareholders of Myonexus based on the achievement of certain sales-and regulatory- related milestones. The acquisition was accounted for as an asset acquisition as substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a group of similar identifiable assets (the five LGMD gene therapy programs). The Company determined that one regulatory-related milestone (not solely based on drug approval by the FDA) met the definition of a derivative and recorded a contingent consideration liability. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the contingent consideration liability was $ 35.5 million and $ 42.0 million, respectively. The changes in fair value are recorded within other (loss) income, net, in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Please read Note 5, Fair Value Measurements for further information on the change in fair value of the contingent consideration liability. Lysogene S.A. and Henogen S.A. In October 2018, the Company entered into a license and collaboration agreement to develop and commercialize LYS-SAF302, a gene therapy to treat Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA (“MPS IIIA”) as well as an equity investment agreement with Lysogene S.A. (“Lysogene”). Under the license and collaboration agreement, in addition to the payment of up-front fees, the Company was potentially liable for a total of $ 102.8 million in development, regulatory and sales milestones. Furthermore, the Company was potentially required to make tiered royalty payments based on net sales of the LYS-SAF302 product subsequent to its commercialization. Beginning January 1, 2020, the Company began to reimburse Lysogene for expenses incurred in connection with development activities of the MPS IIIA product candidate. The Company sent a termination notice to Lysogene on January 11, 2022 to notify them of the Company's intent to terminate the license and collaboration agreement. The termination became effective July 11, 2022. The Company is not obligated to pay early termination penalties to Lysogene, but incurred research and development reimbursements in the six months following termination totaling $ 0.8 million. The Company entered into a development, manufacturing and supply agreement with Henogen S.A. (“Henogen”) in December 2019. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Henogen agreed to reserve manufacturing capacity within their facility to develop, manufacture and supply the Company with LYS-SAF302. On June 9, 2022, the Company and Henogen entered into an agreement to terminate the development, manufacturing and supply agreement. As a result, the Company recorded a charge of $ 17.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, which was recorded in research and development expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. F- 17 Lacerta Therapeutics In August 2018, the Company entered into a license, development and option agreement (the “Lacerta License Agreement”) and a Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Lacerta Stock Purchase Agreement”) with Lacerta Therapeutics, Inc.

Pursuant to the Lacerta License Agreement, the Company licensed exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize a pre-clinical Pompe product candidate (the “Pompe License”). Lacerta also granted the Company exclusive options to enter into exclusive license agreements to develop, manufacture and commercialize other gene therapy product candidates for Sanfilipo syndrome and L-Amino Acid Decarboxylase Deficiency for additional consideration of $ 42.0 million (collectively, the “Options”) when (and if) the Options are exercised. In November 2022, the Company provided written notice of its intent to terminate the Lacerta License Agreement. The termination will become effective May 8, 2023. Once effective, the Company will no longer be liable for any remaining development, regulatory and sales milestones associated with the Pompe License and will no longer be required to make tiered royalty payments based on net sales of the Pompe product subsequent to its commercialization. Under the Lacerta Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company purchased approximately 4.5 million shares of Series A preferred stock issued by Lacerta. Under the agreements, the Company made an up-front payment of $ 38.0 million to Lacerta, of which $ 30.0 million was allocated to the Series A preferred stock investment and recorded as an other non-current asset in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the carrying value of the investment are reported as a component of earnings whenever there are triggering events that warrant impairment or observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of Lacerta in the futur e. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 , the Company did no t record any changes in carrying value of the investment as Lacerta did not issue identical or similar shares during the corresponding periods nor were there any triggering events that resulted in the impairment of the investment. For the year ended December 31, 2022 , no development or regulatory milestones were deemed probable of being achieved and, accordingly, no additional expense has been recognized. Nationwide Children’s Hospital In December 2016, the Company entered into an exclusive option agreement with Nationwide Children’s Hospital (“Nationwide”) from which the Company obtained an exclusive right to acquire a worldwide license of the micro-dystrophin gene therapy technology for Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy. In October 2018, the Company exercised the option and entered into a license agreement with Nationwide, which granted the Company exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize a micro-dystrophin gene therapy product candidate. In July 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with Nationwide to settle a dispute relating to a sublicense payment owed by the Company resulting from the up-front payment received from Roche under the Roche Agreement. The total sublicense payment payable to Nationwide under the agreement is $ 38.0 million, which was paid in July 2021. Approximately $ 9.3 million of this amount was expensed during the year ended December 31, 2020 with the rema ining $ 28.7 million expensed during the year ended December 31, 2021. The expense relating to this payment was recognized to research and development expense. As a result of this payment, the Company has no further financial obligations to Nationwide resulting from the up-front payment received under the Roche Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2022 , no development or regulatory milestones were deemed probable of being achieved and, accordingly, no additional in-licensed rights or expenses have been recognized. BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. In July 2017, the Company and UWA entered into a settlement agreement with BioMarin. On the same day, the Company entered into a license agreement, which was subsequently amended in April 2019, with BioMarin and Academisch Ziekenhuis Leiden (“AZL”) (collectively with the Company, UWA and BioMarin, the “Settlement Parties”). Under these agreements and amendment, BioMarin agreed to provide the Company with an exclusive license to certain intellectual property with an option to convert the exclusive license into a co-exclusive license and the Settlement Parties agreed to stop most existing efforts to continue with ongoing litigation and opposition and other administrative proceedings concerning BioMarin’s intellectual property.

The tables below present information about the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that are measured and carried at fair value and indicate the level within the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques it utilizes to determine such fair value: Fair Value Measurement as of December 31, 2022 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 (in thousands) Assets Money market funds $ 467,553 $ 467,553 $ — $ — Commercial paper 211,369 — 211,369 — Government and government agency bonds 807,540 — 807,540 — Corporate bonds 125,741 — 125,741 — Strategic investments 31,321 321 — 31,000 Certificates of deposit 42,745 — 42,745 — Total assets $ 1,686,269 $ 467,874 $ 1,187,395 $ 31,000 Liabilities Contingent consideration $ 36,900 $ — $ — $ 36,900 Total liabilities $ 36,900 $ — $ — $ 36,900 Fair Value Measurement as of December 31, 2021 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 (in thousands) Assets Money market funds $ 1,562,358 $ 1,562,358 $ — $ — Strategic investments 34,892 2,480 — 32,412 Certificates of deposit 250 250 — — Total assets $ 1,597,500 $ 1,565,088 $ — $ 32,412 Liabilities Contingent consideration $ 43,600 $ — $ — $ 43,600 Total liabilities $ 43,600 $ — $ — $ 43,600 The Company’s assets with a fair value categorized as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy include money market funds and the Company’s strategic investment in Lysogene, a publicly traded company in France, as more fully described in Note 3, License and Collaboration Agreements . The Company's assets with a fair value categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy consist of commercial paper, government and government agency bonds, corporate bonds and certificates of deposit. These assets have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued at the end of each reporting period utilizing third-party pricing services. The Company uses observable market inputs to determine value, which primarily consist of reportable trades. Certain of the short-term investments with original maturities of less than three months are presented as cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022. The Company did not hold any short-term investments as of December 31, 2021. The Company’s assets with a fair value categorized as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy consist of a strategic investment in Series A preferred stock of Lacerta as more fully described in Note 3, License and Collaboration Agreements and strategic investments in two other private companies. At the end of each reporting period, the fair value of the Company's strategic investments will be adjusted if the issuers were to issue similar or identical securities or when there is a triggering event for impairment. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the company recorded impairment losses of $ 2.6 million and $ 4.5 million, respectively, related to its investments in the private companies. F- 20 The following table represents a roll-forward of the fair value of Level 3 financial assets for each of the periods indicated: As of December 31, 2022 2021 (in thousands) Fair value, beginning of year $ 32,412 $ 35,100 Additions 1,163 1,800 Changes in estimated fair value ( 2,575 ) ( 4,488 ) Fair value, end of year $ 31,000 $ 32,412 The Company’s contingent consideration liability with a fair value categorized as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy relates to the regulatory-related contingent payments to Myonexus selling shareholders as well as to two academic institutions under separate license agreements that meet the definition of a derivative. For more information related to Myonexus, please read Note 3, License and Collaboration Agreements . The contingent consideration liability was estimated using an income approach based on the probability-weighted expected cash flows that incorporated industry-based probability adjusted assumptions relating to the achievement of the milestone and thus the likelihood of making the payments. This fair value measurement was based upon significant inputs not observable in the market and therefore represented a Level 3 measurement. Significant changes which increase or decrease the probabilities of achieving the milestone, or shorten or lengthen the time required to achieve the milestone, would result in a corresponding increase or decrease in the fair value of the liability. At the end of each reporting period, the fair value is adjusted to reflect the most current assumptions through earnings. The following table represents a roll-forward of the fair value of Level 3 financial liabilities for each of the periods indicated: As of December 31, 2022 2021 (in thousands) Fair value, beginning of year $ 43,600 $ 50,800 Additions — — Changes in estimated fair value, net ( 6,700 ) ( 7,200 ) Fair value, end of year $ 36,900 $ 43,600 N et decreases of $ 6.7 million and $ 7.2 million were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, to account for the change in fair value of existing contingent consideration liabilities. These changes, which are recorded through earnings, were a result of updates made to certain inputs and assumptions impacting the probability-weighted expected cash flows, principally the probability of success of the underlying programs, the approval date of the underlying programs and the estimate of the amount of payments to be ultimately made. As of December 31, 2022, the contingent consideration was recorded as a non-current liability on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximated fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments. For fair value information related to the Company’s debt facilities, please read Note 13, Indebtedness . 6.

INDEBTEDNESS 2027 Convertible Notes Issuance On September 16, 2022, the Company issued $ 1,150.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due on September 15, 2027 . The 2027 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and bear interest at a rate of 1.25 % per annum, payable semi-annually in cash on each March 15 and September 15, commencing on March 15, 2023. The net proceeds were $ 1,126.7 million after deducting the discounts and offering expenses of $ 23.3 million. The debt discount is amortized under the effective interest method and recorded as additional interest expense over the life of the 2027 Notes. The effective interest rate on the 2027 Notes is 1.67 %. The aggregate issuance of the 2027 Notes includes the issuance of $ 20.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 2027 Notes to the Michael A. Chambers Living Trust, an entity affiliated with Michael Chambers, a member of the Company’s board of directors. The 2027 Notes may be convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock under certain circumstances prior to maturity at a conversion rate of 7.0439 shares per $ 1,000 principal amount of the 2027 Notes ( 8,100,485 shares of the Company’s common stock in the aggregate), which represents a conversion price of $ 141.97 per share, subject to adjustment under certain conditions. Upon conversion, the Company may pay cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and stock, as determined by the Company at its discretion. The holders of the 2027 Notes may convert their 2027 Notes at their option only in the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on December 31, 2022, if the last reported sale price per share of common stock exceeds 130 % of the conversion price for each of at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter; (2) during the five consecutive business days immediately after any five consecutive trading day period (the “measurement period”) in which the trading price per $ 1,000 principal amount of 2027 Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price per share of our common stock on such trading day and the conversion rate on such trading day; (3) upon the occurrence of F- 26 certain corporate events or distributions on the Company's common stock, as described in the indenture agreement; (4) if the Company calls such notes for redemption; and (5) at any time from, and including, March 15, 2027 until the close of business on the second trading day immediately before the maturity date. The 2027 Notes are not redeemable by the Company prior to September 20, 2025. On or after September 20, 2025, the Company may redeem for cash all or any portion of the 2027 Notes at a redemption price equal to the principal amount of the 2027 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if the last reported sale price of the Company’s common stock exceeds 130 % of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period. Holders of the 2027 Notes have the right to require the Company to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their notes at 100 % of its respective principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, upon the occurrence of a fundamental change as defined in the indenture agreement for the 2027 Notes. The 2027 Notes contain customary covenants and events of default, occurrence of which permits the holders to accelerate all outstanding obligations, including principal and interest. 2022 Capped Call Transactions In connection with the issuance of the 2027 Notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with counterparties intended to minimize the impact of potential dilution upon conversion of the 2027 Notes (the “2022 Capped Calls”). The 2022 Capped Calls have an initial strike price of approximately $ 141.97 per share, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the 2027 Notes and is subject to anti-dilution adjustments generally similar to those applicable to the 2027 Notes and have a cap price of approximately $ 210.32 per share. The 2022 Capped Calls cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, 8,100,485 shares of the Company’s common stock, which is the same number of shares of the Company’s common stock initially underlying the 2027 Notes. If, upon conversion of the 2027 Notes, the price of the Company’s common stock is between the strike price and the cap price of the capped calls, the counterparties will deliver shares of the Company’s common stock and/or cash with an aggregate value equal to the difference between the price of the Company’s common stock at the conversion date and the strike price, multiplied by the number of shares of the Company’s common stock related to the capped calls being exercised. The Company paid $ 127.3 million for the 2022 Capped Calls, which was recorded within additional paid-in capital. 2024 Convertible Notes Issuance On November 14, 2017, the Company issued $ 570.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior convertible notes due on November 15, 2024 . The 2024 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and bear interest at a rate of 1.50 % per annum, payable semi-annually in cash on each May 15 and November 15, commencing on May 15, 2018. The net proceeds were $ 559.4 million after deducting the discounts and offering expenses of $ 10.6 million. The debt discount is amortized under the effective interest method and recorded as additional interest expense over the life of the 2024 Notes. The effective interest rate on the 2024 Notes is 1.9 %. The 2024 Notes may be convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock under certain circumstances prior to maturity at a conversion rate of 13.621 shares per $ 1,000 principal amount of the 2024 Notes ( 7,763,970 shares of the Company's common stock in the aggregate), which represents a conversion price of $ 73.42 per share, subject to adjustment under certain conditions. Upon conversion, the Company may pay cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and stock, as determined by the Company at its discretion. The holders of the 2024 Notes may convert their 2024 Notes at their option only in the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on December 31, 2017, if the last reported sale price per share of common stock exceeds 130 % of the conversion price for each of at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter; (2) during the five consecutive business days immediately after any five consecutive trading day period (the “measurement period”) in which the trading price per $ 1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price per share of our common stock on such trading day and the conversion rate on such trading day; (3) upon the occurrence of certain corporate events or distributions on the Company's common stock, as described in the indenture agreement; and (4) at any time from, and including, May 15, 2024 until the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. The 2024 Notes are not redeemable by the Company prior to the maturity date. Holders of the 2024 Notes have the right to require the Company to repurchase for cash all or a portion of their notes at 100 % of its respective principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, upon the occurrence of a fundamental change as defined in the indenture agreement for the 2024 Notes. The 2024 Notes contain customary covenants and events of default, occurrence of which permits the holders to accelerate all outstanding obligations, including principal and interest. 2017 Capped Call Transactions In connection with the issuance of the 2024 Notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with counterparties intended to minimize the impact of potential dilution upon conversion of the 2024 Notes (the “2017 Capped Calls”). The 2017 Capped Calls have an initial strike price of approximately $ 73.42 per share, which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the 2024 Notes and is subject to anti-dilution adjustments generally similar to those applicable to the 2024 Notes, F- 27 and have a cap price of approximately $ 104.88 per share. The 2017 Capped Calls initially covered, subject to anti-dilution adjustments , 7,763,970 sh ares of the Company’s common stock, which is the same number of shares of the Company’s common stock initially underlying the 2024 Notes. If, upon conversion of the 2024 Notes, the price of the Company’s common stock is between the strike price and the cap price of the capped calls, the counterparties will deliver shares of the Company’s common stock and/or cash with an aggregate value equal to the difference between the price of the Company’s common stock at the conversion date and the strike price, multiplied by the number of shares of the Company’s common stock related to the capped calls being exercised. The Company paid $ 50.9 million for the 2017 Capped Calls, which was recorded within additional paid-in capital. 2024 Notes Repurchase In connection with the issuance of the 2027 Notes, on September 14, 2022, the Company entered into separate, privately negotiated transactions to repurchase a portion of the outstanding 2024 Notes. The holders exchanged $ 150.6 million in aggregate principal value of 2024 Notes held by them for an aggregate payment of $ 248.6 million for full settlement of the principal value and accrued interest on such date. The repurchase was not pursuant to the conversion privileges included in the terms of the debt at issuance and therefore was accounted for as a debt extinguishment. The Company accounted for the debt extinguishment by recognizing the difference between the reacquisition price of the debt and the net carrying amount of the extinguished debt as loss on debt extinguishment. Accordingly, on the repurchase date, the Company: (i) reduced the carrying value of repurchased 2024 Notes by $ 149.3 million, (ii) eliminated accrued interest of $ 0.8 million, and (iii) recorded $ 98.5 million of debt extinguishment expense which is included in the loss on debt extinguishment in consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The outstanding principal balance of the 2024 Notes as of December 31, 2022, after considering the repurchase discussed above, i s $ 419.4 million, which is convertible into 5,712,253 shares of Company common stock. 2017 Capped Calls Partial Settlement As a result of the repurchase of a portion of the 2024 Notes discussed above, on September 19, 2022, the Company entered into agreements with the 2017 Capped Calls counterparties to terminate a portion of the 2017 Capped Calls in a notional amount corresponding to the principal amount of the 2024 Notes repurchased. In connection with the termination, the Company received $ 26.3 million in cash from the counterparties, which was included within additional paid-in capital. Termination of 2019 Term Loan On September 16, 2022, using proceeds received from the issuance of the 2027 Notes described above, the Company prepaid in full all of its amounts outstanding with respect to the December 2019 term loan with Biopharma Credit PLC and Biopharma Credit Investments V (Master) LP (the ""December 2019 Term Loan"") and repaid in full all obligations due. The aggregate payoff amount was approximately $ 585.5 million, which includes $ 550.0 million of principal, additional loan consideration and premiums of $ 25.4 million, and accrued interest of $ 10.1 million through the repayment date. The loss on debt extinguishment was $ 26.9 million, and is included in the loss on debt extinguishment in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Derivatives Embedded derivatives are required to be separated from the host contract and accounted for as a derivative instrument if the economic characteristics and risk of the embedded derivative are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract and if a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would be a derivative instrument subject to the scope of ASC 815. ASC 815 includes a scope exception for instruments issued by a reporting entity that are both (1) indexed to the reporting entity’s own stock and (2) classified in stockholders’ equity in the reporting entity’s statement of financial position. All of the features of the 2027 Notes were evaluated to determine if separate accounting as a derivative instrument was required. The conversion feature in the 2027 Notes is indexed solely in the Company's common stock and since the Company retains the option to settle these notes in shares, the conversion feature qualified for a “scope exception” from treatment as a derivative since the conversion feature qualifies as “fixed for fixed”, meaning the settlement is equal to the difference between a fixed monetary amount of convertible notes and the fair value of a fixed number of the Company’s shares, and therefore, the Company did not separately account for it as a derivative. Other features of the notes, such as rights under certain default events, were not considered clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the underlying debt host instrument, however, the fair value of these features were determined to be immaterial. The capped calls are indexed solely to the Company’s common stock and classified in stockholders’ equity since Sarepta retains the right to receive shares if there is an exercise of the capped call options. The premiums paid for the capped call options, equal to their fair value at inception, were recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital. Total Debt Obligations As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded approximately $ 1,544.3 million and $ 1,096.9 million as long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheets. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded $ 53.2 million, $ 63.5 million and $ 59.9 million of contractual interest expense, respectively. Contractual interest expense for the years ended F- 28 December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 is inclusive of $ 7.5 million, $ 7.6 million and $ 25.5 million of amortization of debt discounts, respectively. The following table summarizes the Company’s debt facilities for the periods indicated: As of December 31, 2022 2021 (in thousands) Principal amount of the 2024 Notes $ 419,371 $ 569,993 Principal amount of the 2027 Notes 1,150,000 — Unamortized discount - debt issuance costs of 2024 Notes ( 3,059 ) ( 6,320 ) Unamortized discount - debt issuance costs of 2027 Notes ( 22,020 ) — Net carrying value of the convertible notes 1,544,292 563,673 Principal amount of the 2019 Term Loan — 550,000 Unamortized discounts — ( 16,797 ) Net carrying value of 2019 Term Loan — 533,203 Total carrying value of debt facilities $ 1,544,292 $ 1,096,876 Fair value of 2024 Notes $ 765,046 $ 846,138 Fair value of 2027 Notes 1,308,482 — Fair value of 2019 Term Loan — 576,085 Total fair value of debt facilities $ 2,073,528 $ 1,422,223 The fair values of the 2027 Notes and 2024 Notes are based on open market trades and is classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the December 2019 Term Loan is classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy and is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis with market interest rates adjusted for credit risk as a significant input. The following table summarizes the total principal payments due under the Company’s debt arrangements: As of December 31, 2022 (in thousands) 2023 $ — 2024 419,371 2025 — 2026 — 2027 1,150,000 Thereafter — Total payments $ 1,569,371 The aggregate annual maturities of long-term debt principal and contractual interest during the years ending December 31, 2023, 2024, 2025, 2026 and 2027 are $ 20.6 million, $ 440.0 million, $ 14.4 million, $ 14.4 million and $ 1,164.4 million, respectively. 14.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION In June 2013, the Company’s stockholders approved the 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “2013 ESPP”) which authorized 0.3 million shares of common stock available to be issued. In June 2016 and 2019, the Company’s stockholders approved an additional 0.3 million and 0.5 million shares, respectively, of common stock available for issuance under the 2013 ESPP. As of December 31, 2022, 0.2 million shares of common stock remain available for future grant under the 2013 ESPP. In September 2014, the Company initiated the 2014 Employment Commencement Incentive Plan (the “2014 Plan”). The 2014 Plan, which authorized 0.6 million shares of common stock to be issued and allows for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights (""SARs""), RSAs, RSUs, performance shares and performance units. As of December 31, 2022, 7.0 million shares ha ve been added to the Company's 2014 Plan. As of December 31, 2022, 0.8 million shares of common stock remain available for future grant under the 2014 Plan. In June 2018, the Company’s stockholders approved the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2018 Plan”). The 2018 Plan, which authorized 2.9 million shares of common stock to be issued, allows for the grant of stock options, SARs, RSAs, RSUs, performance shares and performan ce units. In June 2020, an additional 3.8 million shares of common stock were approved by the Company’s stockholders and added to the 2018 Plan.

Stock Options In general, stock options have a ten-year term and vest over a four-year period, with one-fourth of the underlying shares vesting on the first anniversary of the grant and 1/48th of the underlying shares vesting monthly thereafter, such that the underlying shares will be fully vested on the fourth anniversary of the grant, subject to the terms of the applicable plan under which they were granted. The fair values of stock options granted during the periods presented are measured on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, with the following assumptions: For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Risk-free interest rate (1) 1.6 - 4.2 % 0.4 - 1.3 % 0.1 - 1.3 % Expected dividend yield (2) — — — Expected term (3) 5.09 years 4.99 years 5.00 years Expected volatility (4) 52.4 - 72.9 % 60.1 - 70.8 % 57.3 - 68.2 % The amounts estimated according to the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model may not be indicative of the actual values realized upon the exercise of these options by the holders. F- 30 The following table summarizes the Company’s stock option activity for the period indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 Weighted Average Shares Exercise Price Grants outstanding at beginning of the period 8,196,921 $ 69.39 Granted 1,777,370 84.70 Exercised ( 318,258 ) 70.25 Cancelled and forfeited ( 525,893 ) 109.31 Grants outstanding at end of the period 9,130,140 $ 70.04 Grants exercisable at end of the period 4,692,578 $ 70.27 Grants vested and expected to vest at end of the period 8,696,519 $ 69.05 The weighted-average grant date fair value per share of stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 48.82 , $ 48.16 and $ 61.38 , respectively. Weighted Average Aggregate Remaining Intrinsic Value Contractual (in thousands) Life (Years) Options outstanding at December 31, 2022 $ 557,927 6.1 Options exercisable at December 31, 2022 $ 289,473 5.2 Options vested and expected to vest at December 31, 2022 $ 540,503 6.0 The following table summarizes the Company’s shares vested and stock options exercised for each of the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (in thousands) Aggregate grant date fair value of shares vested $ 140,889 $ 79,068 $ 80,355 Aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised $ 12,150 $ 10,622 $ 144,750 Grant Modification In June 2017, the Company granted its Chief Executive Officer 3,300,000 options with service and market conditions which were subject to a five-year cliff vesting schedule. On April 19, 2022 (the “Effective Date”), the Company entered into an agreement with its Chief Executive Officer to modify the vesting conditions of the options. Under the agreement, one-third of the options vested (the “Vested Tranche”) on the Effective Date with no required service or market conditions. Subject to the Chief Executive Officer's continued service through each applicable vesting date and the compound annual growth rate of the Company's common stock exceeding that of the Nasdaq Biotech Index in varying percentages, the remaining two-thirds of the options (the “Unvested Tranche”) shall vest in varying increments at any time between the Effective Date and June 26, 2025 (the “Measurement Period”) when (and if) the average of the closing price of the Company’s common stock during any consecutive 20 trading day period during the Measurement Period reaches certain pre-determined target stock prices. Additionally, the Chief Executive Officer is subject to a one-year post-exercise restriction to sell, transfer or dispose shares acquired upon the exercise of any options that vest after deduction of any shares withheld or sold to pay the applicable aggregate exercise price and/or withholding taxes. To determine the incremental compensation cost of the modification, the fair value of the modified awards was compared to the fair value of the original awards measured immediately before its terms or conditions were modified. As the Vested Tranche became immediately vested on the Effective Date, the Vested Tranche does not have service or market conditions. As such, the post-modification fair value for the Vested Tranche is based on the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, while the pre-modification fair value is based on a lattice model with Monte Carlo simulations. The Unvested Tranche represents awards with market conditions only. Both the pre- and post-modification fair values for the Unvested Tranche are determined by a lattice model with Monte Carlo simulations. The incremental compensation costs related to varying increments of the Unvested Tranche will be recognized as stock-based compensation expense over their respective derived service periods, an output from the Monte Carlo simulation, and will be fully recognized over a 1.3 year period from the date of modification. F- 31 During the year ended December 31, 2022 , 550,110 options relating to the Unvested Tranche met the conditions for vesting in that the average closing price of the Company's common stock exceeded $ 105.74 during 20 consecutive trading days in August 2022 and the compound annual growth rate of the Company's common stock exceeded that of the Nasdaq Biotech Index by greater than 5 % . Accordingly, all previously unrecognized expense associated with these options was immediately recognized. The aggregate incremental cost of the modification of the Chief Executive Officer's awards was $ 123.3 million. Of this amount, $ 109.9 million was recognized as stock-based compensation expense during the year ended December 31, 2022. The remaining amount, or $ 13.4 million, will be recognized during the year ended December 31, 2023. Restricted Stock Units The Company grants RSUs to members of its board of directors and employees. The following table summarizes the Company’s RSU activity for the period indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 Weighted Average Grant Date Shares Fair Value Grants outstanding at beginning of the period 1,320,206 $ 98.69 Granted * 1,044,826 85.39 Vested ( 389,761 ) 103.05 Forfeited ( 145,639 ) 93.36 Grants outstanding at end of the period 1,829,632 $ 90.59 * Included in this amount are 38,500 RSUs with performance conditions relating to regulatory approval of certain of the Company's product candidates. As of December 31, 2022, none of the performance conditions were probable of being achieved. Accordingly, no stock-based compensation relating to these grants has been recognized. If t he performance milestones are achieved within the required time frame, the Company may recognize up to $ 3.1 million of stock-based compensation related to these grants , which represents the aggregate grant date fair value of these awards. All other s tock options and the remaining RSUs granted during the periods presented in the tables above have only service-based vesting conditions and the majority vest over four years . 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan Under the Company’s 2013 ESPP, participating employees purchase common stock through payroll deductions. The purchase price is equal to 85 % of the lower of the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the first business day and the last business day of the relevant purchase period. The 24 -month offering period will end between February 29, 2024 and August 31, 2024 . The following table summarizes the Company’s ESPP activity for each of the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Number of shares purchased 115,124 111,171 102,031 Proceeds received (in millions) $ 7.5 $ 7.8 $ 7.5 Stock-based Compensation Expense The following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense by function included within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss: For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (in thousands) Research and development $ 61,293 $ 50,526 $ 41,671 Selling, general and administrative 171,725 63,417 66,399 Total stock-based compensation $ 233,018 $ 113,943 $ 108,070 F- 32 The following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense by grant type included within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss: For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (in thousands) Stock options $ 174,868 $ 68,995 $ 68,832 Restricted stock awards/units 52,601 40,055 33,457 Employee stock purchase plan 5,549 4,893 5,781 Total stock-based compensation $ 233,018 $ 113,943 $ 108,070 As of December 31, 2022, there was $ 206.6 million of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to the Company’s stock-based compensation plans. The expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately three years. Of this amount, $ 98.9 million relates to options with service conditions only, $ 13.4 million relates to awards with service and market conditions, and the remaining $ 94.3 million related to restricted st ock units with service conditions only. 16. 401 (K) PLAN The Company sponsors a 401(k) Plan (“the Plan”) in the U.S. and other retirement plans in the rest of the world, all of which are defined contribution plans. The Plan is available to all employees who are age 21 or older. Participants may make voluntary contributions and the Company makes matching contributions according to the Plan’s matching formula. Matching contributions fully vest after one year of service for all employees. The expense related to the Plan primarily consists of the Company’s matching contributions. Expense related to the Plan totaled $ 6.5 million, $ 5.3 million and $ 5.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 , respectively. 17.

INCOME TAXES The following table summarizes the loss before the provision (benefit) for income taxes by jurisdiction for the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (in thousands) Domestic $ ( 251,384 ) $ ( 47,633 ) $ ( 204,956 ) Foreign ( 438,579 ) ( 371,315 ) ( 348,109 ) Total $ ( 689,963 ) $ ( 418,948 ) $ ( 553,065 ) The following table summarizes provision (benefit) for income taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (in thousands) Current provision: Federal $ — $ — $ 4 State 13,193 ( 40 ) 624 Foreign 944 181 680 Total current provision 14,137 141 1,308 Deferred benefit: Federal — — — State — — — Foreign ( 612 ) ( 309 ) ( 245 ) Total deferred benefit ( 612 ) ( 309 ) ( 245 ) Total income tax expense (benefit) $ 13,525 $ ( 168 ) $ 1,063 The following table summarizes the reconciliation between the Company’s effective tax rate and the statutory income tax rate for each of the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Federal income tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 % State taxes 4.1 0.4 0.6 Research and development and other tax credits 6.9 10.0 10.1 Valuation allowance ( 14.7 ) ( 9.8 ) ( 21.3 ) Permanent differences ( 3.3 ) ( 0.3 ) ( 1.6 ) Stock-based compensation ( 1.2 ) ( 3.0 ) 3.5 Foreign rate differential ( 13.2 ) ( 18.4 ) ( 12.9 ) Other ( 1.6 ) 0.1 0.4 Effective tax rate ( 2.0 ) % ( 0.0 ) % ( 0.2 ) % Permanent differences affecting the Company’s effective tax rate primarily include the premium paid to repurchase a portion of the 2024 Notes, excess stock-based compensation tax deductions, net of non-deductible stock-based compensation and limitation on deductibility of officer compensations. F- 34 The following table summarizes the analysis of the deferred tax assets and liabilities for each of the periods indicated: As of December 31, 2022 2021 (in thousands) Deferred tax assets: Net operating loss carryforwards $ 241,826 $ 330,392 Difference in depreciation and amortization 39,725 31,563 Research and development tax credits 261,067 201,512 Stock-based compensation 80,193 38,132 Lease liabilities 11,782 10,890 Capitalized inventory 33,366 24,172 Debt discount 35,975 5,875 Capitalized research and development costs 74,886 — Other 44,022 38,315 Total deferred tax assets 822,842 680,851 Deferred tax liabilities: Right of use asset ( 9,174 ) ( 7,405 ) Debt discount — — Total deferred tax liabilities ( 9,174 ) ( 7,405 ) Valuation allowance ( 811,908 ) ( 672,319 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 1,760 $ 1,127 For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminates the option to currently deduct research and development expenses and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize the costs over five years for research activities performed in the United States and 15 years for research activities performed outside the United States. The provision required the Company to record a current state tax expense of $ 13.2 million primarily due to the temporary suspension of utilizing net operating loss carryforwards in certain states the Company operates in. The Company has evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of its U.S. net deferred tax assets, which are comprised principally of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, research and development tax credit carryforwards, capitalized research and development costs, stock-based compensation expense, capitalized inventory, and intangibles. Under the applicable accounting standards, management has considered the Company’s history of losses and concluded that it is more likely than not that the Company will not recognize the benefits of net federal and state deferred tax assets. Accordingly, a full valuation allowance against the U.S. net deferred tax asset is maintained at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The net change in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was an increase of $ 139.6 million and $ 66.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. This increase for the year ended December 31, 2022 was primarily due to the generation of federal and state income tax credits, an increase in equity compensation, capitalized research and development costs and an increase in the debt discount deferred tax asset as a result of the integration of the 2022 Capped Calls associated with the 2027 Notes, which from a tax perspective resulted in an increase to the valuation allowance which was recorded through equity. The Company generated foreign deferred tax assets mainly consisting of net operating loss carryforwards, stock-based compensation and unrealized gain/losses. Based upon the income projections in the majority of the foreign jurisdictions, the Company believes it will realize the benefit of its future deductible differences in these jurisdictions. As such, the Company has not recorded a valuation allowance against these foreign jurisdictions. Brazil and the Netherlands have generated deferred tax assets, which consist primarily of net operating loss carryforwards. The Company has concluded that it is more likely than not that we will not recognize the future benefits of the deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions, and accordingly, a full valuation allowance has been recorded against these foreign deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2022 , the Company had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $ 925.7 million and $ 616.2 million, respectively, available to reduce future taxable income. Federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of $ 229.8 million and $ 572.0 million will expire at various dates between 2023 and 2041 . Federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $ 695.9 million and $ 44.2 million, respectively, can be carried forward indefinitely. Utilization of these net operating losses could be limited under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and similar state laws based on historical or future ownership changes and the value of the Company’s stock. Additionally, the Company has $ 180.1 million and $ 102.4 million of federal and state research and development credits, respectively, available to offset future taxable income. These federal and state research and development credits begin to expire between 2023 and 2042 and between 2023 and 2037, respectively. The Company also has foreign net operating loss F- 35 carryforwards of $ 15.3 million, mainly derived from the net operating loss gene rated by its subsidiary in Brazil, which may be carried forward indefinitely. The Company, or one of its subsidiaries, files income tax returns in the U.S., and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The federal, state and foreign income tax returns are generally subject to tax examinations for the tax years ended December 31, 2019 through December 31, 2022. To the extent the Company has tax attribute carryforwards, the tax years in which the attribute was generated may still be adjusted upon examination by the Internal Revenue Service, state or foreign tax authorities to the extent utilized in a future period. The follow table summarizes the reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of total unrecognized tax benefits for each of the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (in thousands) Balance at beginning of the period $ 53,815 $ 48,475 $ 41,753 Increase related to current year tax positions 8,079 5,503 6,722 Increase related to prior year tax positions — — — Decrease related to prior year tax positions ( 190 ) ( 163 ) — Balance at end of the period $ 61,704 $ 53,815 $ 48,475 The balance of total unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2022 , if recognized, would not affect the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations, due to a full valuation allowance against the Company’s U.S. deferred tax assets. The Company does not expect that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly in the next twelve months. The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. It had no accrual for interest or penalties on its consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2022 or 2021. No interest and/or penalties were recognized in 2022 or 2021. The Company’s intent is to only make distributions from non-U.S. subsidiaries in the future when they can be made at no net tax cost. Otherwise, the Company considers all of its foreign earnings to be permanently reinvested outside of the U.S. and has no plans to repatriate these foreign earnings to the U.S. The Company has no material unremitted earnings from its non-U.S. subsidiaries. Effective December 31, 2021, the Company adopted a policy to account for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (""GILTI"") as a period cost under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 19. LEASES The Company has real estate operating leases in Cambridge, Andover, Burlington and Bedford, Massachusetts, Dublin and Columbus, Ohio, and Durham, North Carolina that provide for scheduled annual rent increases throughout each lease’s term. The Company has also identified leases embedded in certain of its manufacturing and supply agreements as the Company determined that it controls the use of the facilities and related equipment therein. For more information related to manufacturing and supply agreements with Catalent, Inc. (“Catalent”), please refer to Note 21, Commitments and Contingencies . Bedford, Massachusetts On April 22, 2022, the Company entered into a lease agreement (the “Bedford Lease”) for 288,000 square feet of to-be-constructed research and development and manufacturing space in Bedford, Massachusetts. The term of the Bedford Lease commences upon the landlord’s completion of the initial construction of the core and shell of the building, at which time the Company will obtain control of the premises and commence internal construction activities. The Company is not involved in the initial construction of the core and shell of the building and will record the lease liability and ROU asset on its consolidated balance sheets when it obtains control of the premises, which is currently expected to be during the first quarter of 2023. The initial term of the Bedford Lease is anticipated to be 15 years commencing at the earlier of (i) date the certificate of occupancy is issued; or (ii) January 1, 2024, representing the establishment of the Company’s obligation to pay rent for the premises. The Company has two options to extend the lease for a period of ten years each, exercisable under certain conditions and at a market rate determined in accordance with the lease agreement. Undiscounted minimum rent payments due over the 15 -year term of the lease aggregate to $ 307.4 million. Additionally, the Company is responsible for reimbursing the landlord for the Company’s share of the property’s operating expenses and property taxes. F- 36 The Bedford lease also provides for a tenant improvement allowance of $ 72.0 million to be used towards costs incurred by the Company in the design and construction of the premises. In May 2022, in connection with the execution of the Bedford Lease, the Company issued a letter of credit collateralized by cash deposits of approximately $ 8.4 million, which was included as restricted cash in the other non-current assets of the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Such letter of credit shall be reduced to approximately $ 5.6 million at the commencement of the fourth rent year, provided certain conditions set forth in the Bedford Lease are satisfied. Columbus, Ohio On December 22, 2018, the Company entered into a lease agreement for a research and development facility in Columbus, Ohio (the “Columbus Lease”). On May 19, 2022 (the ""Columbus Lease Amendment Date""), the Company entered into an amendment to the Columbus Lease to expand the footprint and extend the lease term from June 2026 to December 2036 (the “Columbus Amendment”). The Columbus Amendment will expand from its current form of approximately 78,000 square feet to 167,000 square feet through a series of expansion spaces commencing at various periods through January 1, 2025. Each expansion space commences on the date which approximates when the landlord will deliver control of that space for the Company to carry out design and construction activities (the “Columbus Commencement Date”). The Company is obligated to pay rent on each expansion space nine months after the Columbus Commencement Date. The Columbus Lease and Columbus Amendment expire on December 31, 2036, and the Company has options to extend the lease by five years in both 2036 and 2041. Each option is exercisable under certain conditions and at a market rate determined in accordance with the lease agreement. As a result of the Columbus Amendment, total undiscounted rent payments due over the 15 -year term from the Columbus Lease Amendment Date aggregate to $ 38.9 million. On June 1, 2022, the Company commenced design and construction activities on an area of the premises of approximately 18,000 square feet (the “Second Expansion Space”) and, therefore, it was determined that the lease related to the Second Expansion Space had commenced on that date. On October 1, 2022, the Company commenced design and construction activities on an area of the premises of approximately 36,000 (the ""Initial Expansion Space"") and, therefore, it was determined that the lease related to the Initial Expansion space had commenced on that date. The total ROU asset and lease liability associated with the Columbus Lease, inclusive of the Second Expansion Space and the Initial Expansion Space, was $ 10.7 million and $ 16.4 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, ROU assets for operating leases were $ 65.0 million and operating lease liabilities were $ 73.1 million. The following table contains a summary of the lease costs recognized and other information pertaining to the Company’s operating leases for the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 (in thousands) Lease cost Operating lease cost $ 18,184 $ 28,737 Variable lease cost 35,505 18,742 Total lease cost $ 53,689 $ 47,479 Other information Operating lease payments $ 20,778 $ 24,449 Operating lease liabilities arising from obtaining ROU assets $ 40,006 $ 13,225 Weighted average remaining lease term 6.4 years 3.5 years Weighted average discount rate 8.3 % 7.6 % F- 37 The following table summarizes maturities of lease liabilities and the reconciliation of lease liabilities as of December 31, 2022: For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 (in thousands) 2023 $ 21,046 2024 20,754 2025 15,324 2026 8,423 2027 8,518 Thereafter 27,633 Total minimum lease payments 101,698 Less: imputed interest ( 28,631 ) Total operating lease liabilities $ 73,067 Included in the consolidated balance sheet: Current portion of lease liabilities within other current liabilities $ 15,489 Lease liabilities, non-current 57,578 Total operating lease liabilities $ 73,067 20. NET LOSS PER SHARE Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding. Given that the Company recorded a net loss for each of the periods presented, there is no difference between basic and diluted net loss per share since the effect of common stock equivalents would be anti-dilutive and are, therefore, excluded from the diluted net loss per share calculation. For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (in thousands, except per share amounts) Net loss $ ( 703,488 ) $ ( 418,780 ) $ ( 554,128 ) Weighted-average common shares outstanding - basic 87,559 81,262 77,956 Effect of dilutive securities* — — — Weighted-average common shares outstanding - diluted 87,559 81,262 77,956 Net loss per share — basic and diluted $ ( 8.03 ) $ ( 5.15 ) $ ( 7.11 ) * For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, stock options, RSAs, RSUs and ESPP to purchase of approximately 11.2 million, 9.7 million and 9.0 million shares of common stock, respectively, were excluded from the net loss per share calculation as their effect would have been anti-dilutive. The Company accounts for the effect of its 2027 Notes and 2024 Notes on diluted net earnings per share (“EPS”) using the if-converted method as this obligation may be settled in cash or shares at the Company’s option. The effect of potential share settlement is included in the diluted EPS calculation if the effect is more dilutive. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the inclusion of the potential share settlement of the 2027 Notes was anti-dilutive. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the inclusion of the potential share settlement of the 2024 Notes was anti-dilutive. Accordingly, the potential conversion o f 5,712,253 , 7,763,970 and 7,763,970 shares related to the 2024 Notes has been excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and the potential conversion of 8,100,485 shares related to the 2027 Notes has been excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share for the year ended December 31, 2022 . 21. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Manufacturing Obligations The Company has entered into long-term contractual arrangements from time to time for the provision of goods and services. Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. The Company entered into a development, commercial manufacturing, and supply agreement in June 2018 and, subsequently, entered into the first and second amendments in May 2019 and July 2020, respectively, with Thermo, formerly F- 38 Brammer Bio MA, LLC (collectively, the “Thermo Agreements”). Pursuant to the terms of the Thermo Agreements, the Company had access to substantially all of the facility’s eight clean room suites for the Company’s gene therapy programs, subject to certain minimum and maximum volume limitations. The Company determined that the Thermo Agreements contained a lease because the Company had the right to direct the use of the facility and related equipment therein. The lease on four of the eight dedicated clean room suites at Thermo commenced during 2020 and the remaining four commenced during 2021, which is when the dedicated clean room suites became available for use by the Company. In October 2021, the Company executed a third amendment (the “Amendment”) that modified the terms of the Thermo Agreements. The modification significantly decreased the Company’s right of use of the facility’s capacity and significantly reduced the fixed and in-substance fixed payments due over the remaining term of the agreement. The modification was accounted for as a lease termination, resulting in: (i) the derecognition of right of use assets of $ 23.4 million, (ii) the derecognition of lease liabilities of $ 20.1 million, and (iii) the recognition of a loss of $ 3.3 million, which is included in research and development expense. In addition, as a result of the capacity changes associated with the Amendment, $ 21.1 million of accelerated amortization of nonrefundable advance payments made to Thermo that were previously recorded as other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets were charged to research and development expense for the year ended December 31, 2021. Under the Amendment, the Thermo Agreements will expire on December 31, 2028 , or earlier if certain conditions are met. The Company has the ability to extend the term with an 18-months’ notice and an agreement between the two parties. The Company also has the ability to terminate the Thermo Agreements prior to expiration, subject to the payment of additional financial consideration. Further, the Company has committed to guaranteed purchases under the Amendment on a take-or-pay basis regardless of whether services or goods are ordered. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company did not satisfy the total guaranteed purchase requirements in the fiscal year 2022. As such, the Company recognized a loss of approximatel y $ 54.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2022, reflecting the estimated shortfall related to the annual guaranteed purchase requirement for the manufacturing and supply of gene therapy materials. The loss has been classified as research and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2022, with the outstanding liability reflected as accrued contract manufacturing costs within accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 . No similar losses were incurred in 2021 or 2020. Catalent, Inc. The Company entered into a manufacturing collaboration agreement and, subsequently, entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement with Catalent, formerly Paragon Biosciences, Inc. in October 2018 and February 2019, respectively (collectively, the “Catalent Agreements”). Pursuant to the terms of the Catalent Agreements, Catalent agreed to provide the Company with two dedicated clean room suites and an option to reserve two additional clean room suites for its gene therapy programs, subject to certain minimum and maximum volume limitations. In September 2019, the Company exercised the option to gain access to the two additional clean room suites. The Catalent Agreements will expire on December 31, 2024 . The Company has the ability to terminate the Catalent Agreements prior to expiration, subject to the payment of additional financial consideration. The Company determined that the Catalent Agreements contained a lease because the Company had the right to direct the use of the facility and related equipment therein. The lease on all four dedicated clean room suites at Catalent commenced during 2020, which is when the dedicated clean room suites became available for use by the Company. In March 2021, the Company modified the terms of the Catalent Agreements. The modification decreased the Company’s right of use of certain dedicated clean room suites and reduced the fixed and in-substance fixed payments due over the remaining term of the agreement. The modification was accounted for as a partial lease termination, resulting in: (i) the derecognition of right of use assets of $ 22.8 million, (ii) the derecognition of lease liabilities of $ 20.0 million, and (iii) the recognition of a loss of $ 2.8 million, which is included in research and development expense. In November 2022, the Company further modified certain terms of the Catalent Agreements which extended the term of the agreement through December 31, 2028. The extension of the term of the agreement resulted in no change to the Company’s right of use of certain dedicated clean room suites other than the length of the term and extended no additional control over other suites at the date of modification. The change in the term of the Catalent Agreements represents a modification of the existing embedded lease over certain clean room suites. The modification resulted in the following: (i) the recognition of additional right of use assets of $ 19.2 million, (ii) the recognition of additional lease liabilities of $ 19.2 million, and (iii) a $ 3.9 million increase to long-term deposits manufacturing and a corresponding $ 3.9 million decrease to short-term deposits manufacturing, which are included in other current assets and other non-current assets, respectively, within the consolidated balance sheets. The modification also removed certain fixed payments due over the remaining term of the agreement. Further, in order to maintain the Company's dedicated clean room suites, it has committed to guaranteed purchases under the Amendment on a take-or-pay basis regardless of whether services or goods are ordered. As of December 31, 2022, the Company believes it is probable that the guaranteed purchase requirements will be met in the normal course of business throughout the term of the Catalent Agreements. F- 39 Aldevron, LLC The Company entered into a clinical and commercial supply agreement in December 2018, as subsequently amended in June 2020, with Aldevron LLC (“Aldevron”) for the supply of plasmid DNA to fulfill its needs for gene therapy clinical trials and commercial supply (collectively, the “Aldevron Agreements”). Pursuant to the terms of the Aldevron Agreements, Aldevron agreed to reserve a certain amount of manufacturing capacity on a quarterly basis. In return, the Company is required to make advance payments to Aldevron related to the manufacturing capacity. The term of the Aldevron Agreements will expire on December 31, 2026 . The Company has the option to extend the term of the Aldevron Agreements by one year if the Company delivers a written notice of its intention to extend to Aldevron no later than June 1, 2025. Both parties have the right to early terminate without additional penalty. The Company has determined that the Aldevron Agreements do not contain an embedded lease because it does not convey the right to control the use of Aldevron’s facility or related equipment therein. The following table presents non-cancelable contractual obligations arising from long-term contractual arrangements, including obligations related to leases embedded in certain supply agreements: As of December 31, 2022 (in thousands) 2023 $ 649,644 2024 221,774 2025 162,698 2026 117,220 2027 117,220 Thereafter 117,220 Total manufacturing commitments $ 1,385,776 Additionally, should the Company obtain regulatory approval for any drug product candidate produced as a part of the Company’s manufacturing obligations above, additional minimum batch requirements with the respective manufacturing parties would be required. Other Funding Commitments The Company has several on-going clinical trials in various clinical trial stages. Its most significant clinical trial expenditures are to contract research organizations (“CROs”). The CRO contracts are generally cancellable at the Company’s option. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has approximately $ 480.8 million in cancellable future commitments based on existing CRO contracts. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized approximately $ 78.7 million, $ 47.9 million and $ 40.4 million, respectively, for expenditures incurred by CROs. Litigation In the normal course of business, the Company from time to time is named as a party to various legal claims, actions and complaints, which have included and may include matters involving securities, employment, intellectual property, arising from the use of therapeutics utilizing its technology, or others. We record a loss contingency reserve for a legal proceeding when we consider the potential loss probable and we can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss or determine a probable range of loss. We provide disclosure when we consider a loss reasonably possible or when we determine that a loss in excess of a reserve is reasonably possible. We provide an estimate of such reasonably possible losses or an aggregate range of such reasonably possible losses, unless we believe that such an estimate cannot be made. The Company has not recorded any material accruals for loss contingencies and in management's opinion no material range of loss is estimable for the matters described below as of December 31, 2022. On September 15, 2020, REGENXBIO INC. (“RegenX”) and the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania filed a lawsuit against the Company and Sarepta Therapeutics Three, LLC (together, “Sarepta”), in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. The plaintiffs assert patent infringement of U.S. Patent No. 10,526,617 (“the ‘617 Patent”) under 35 U.S.C.§§ 271(a)-(c) based on Sarepta’s alleged direct or indirect manufacture and use of the patented cultured host cell technology allegedly used to make adeno-associated virus (“AAV”) gene therapy products, including SRP-9001. Specifically, the Complaint essentially includes the allegation that Sarepta’s use, and the use by its contract manufacturers on its behalf, of a host cell containing a recombinant acid molecule that encodes a capsid protein having at least 95% amino acid identity to AAVrh10 infringes upon the ‘617 Patent asserted by RegenX. Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief, a judgment of infringement and willful infringement, an unspecified amount of damages that is no less than a reasonable royalty (treble damages), attorneys’ fees and costs, and such other relief as the court deems just and proper. On January 4, 2022, the Court denied Sarepta’s motion to dismiss the case pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) based on the Safe Harbor provision of non-infringement contained in 35 U.S.C. § 271(e)(1). Sarepta answered the Complaint on January 18, 2022, and a case schedule has been set with a trial commencing on January 29, 2024. On July 13, 2021, Nippon Shinyaku Co., Ltd. (“Nippon Shinyaku” or “NS”) filed a lawsuit against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. NS asserts a claim for breach of contract arising from Sarepta filing seven petitions for F- 40 Inter Partes Review (“IPR Petitions”) with the Patent Trial and Appeal Board at the USPTO (PTAB Case Nos. IPR2021-01134, IPR2021-01135, IPR2021-01136, IPR2021-01137, IPR2021-01138, IPR2021-01139, IPR2021-01140) in which Sarepta sought to invalidate certain NS patents concerning exon 53 skipping technology (U.S. Patent Nos. 9,708,361, 10,385,092, 10,407,461, 10,487,106, 10,647,741, 10,662,217, and 10,683,322, respectively, and collectively the “NS Patents”). In addition, NS asserts claims for patent infringement and willful infringement of each of the NS Patents allegedly arising from Sarepta’s activities, including the sale of, its exon 53 skipping product, VYONDYS 53 (golodirsen). NS further seeks a determination of non-infringement by NS alleged to arise from NS’s activities, including the sale of, its exon 53 skipping product, Viltepso (viltolarsen) and invalidity of certain patents licensed to the Company from University of Western Australia (“UWA”) (U.S. Patent Nos. 9,994,851, 10,227,590, and 10,266,827, collectively the “UWA Patents”). NS is seeking legal fees and costs, an unspecified amount of monetary relief (treble damages) attributed to Sarepta’s alleged infringement, and such other relief as the court deems just and proper. In January 2022, the PTAB granted institution of all claims of all NS Patents in response to Sarepta’s IPR Petitions and determined that Sarepta has demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of success in proving that the NS Patents are unpatentable. NS filed a motion for preliminary injunction solely seeking Sarepta’s withdrawal of the IPR Petitions, which was ultimately granted after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed and remanded to the district court on February 8, 2022. Sarepta subsequently withdrew the IPRs, which were terminated on June 14, 2022. On December 27, 2021, the district court partially granted and denied the motion to dismiss by Sarepta and ordered NS to file a Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”), which it did on January 14, 2022. In the SAC, NS maintains all claims of the original complaint of July 13, 2021, except a determination of non-infringement of the UWA Patents. On January 28, 2022, Sarepta filed its answer to the SAC, with defenses and counterclaims against NS and NS Pharma Inc. that include infringement of the UWA Patents allegedly arising from their activities concerning, including the sale of, its exon 53 skipping product, Viltepso (viltolarsen) and breach of contract. Sarepta is also seeking a determination of invalidity of the NS Patents. Sarepta is seeking an award of relief in its defenses to NS’ allegations, a judgment of breach of contract, a determination of invalidity of the NS Patents, a judgment of infringement and willful infringement of the UWA Patents, legal fees and costs, an unspecified amount of monetary relief (treble damages) attributable to NS’ alleged infringement, and such other relief as the court deems just and proper. The Court entered a scheduling order with a trial scheduled to commence on May 13, 2024. F- 41",0000873303,SRPT

Risk Factors Summary Our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those described in Item 1A “Risk Factors”. These risks include, but are not limited to the following: - 3 - - 4 - PART I Item 1. Business. Overview We are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on helping patients through the discovery and development of unique RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene therapy and other genetic therapeutic modalities for the treatment of rare diseases. Applying our proprietary, highly-differentiated and innovative technologies, and through collaborations with our strategic partners, we are developing potential therapeutic candidates for a broad range of diseases and disorders, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy (“Duchenne”), Limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (“LGMDs”) and other neuromuscular and central nervous system (“CNS”) related disorders. We commercialize three products, all of which were granted accelerated approval by the FDA: Exon skipping is intended to promote the production of an internally truncated but functional dystrophin protein. The original PMO structure and variations of this structure that are so-called PMO-based (collectively “PMO-based”) are central to our proprietary chemistry platform. PMO technologies can be used to selectively up-regulate or down-regulate the production of a target protein through pre-mRNA splice alteration. PMO-based compounds have the potential to be designed to create more, less, or none of certain proteins, or produce analogues of endogenous proteins. This technology can be used to correct disease-causing genetic errors by inducing the targeted expression of novel proteins. The PMO chemistry platform is highly adaptable, and we have developed next-generation PMO-based chemistries for advancing RNA-targeted therapeutics. These next-generation chemistries are specifically designed to enhance tissue targeting, intracellular delivery, target selectivity and drug potency. One of these novel technologies is based on cell-penetrating peptide-conjugated PMO (“PPMO”). The PPMO features covalent attachment of a cell-penetrating peptide to a PMO with the goal of enhanced delivery into the cell. Our most advanced PPMO product candidate is SRP-5051, which is designed to treat Duchenne in patients with genetic mutations amenable to exon 51 skipping. As part of our multifaceted approach to Duchenne, we are also developing gene therapy technologies to treat Duchenne. We are clinically developing a product candidate, SRP-9001, that aims to express a smaller but still functional version of dystrophin (“micro-dystrophin”). We use a unique adeno-associated virus (“AAV”) vector called AAVrh.74 to transport the transgene – the genetic material that will make the protein of interest – to the target cells. Micro-dystrophin is used because naturally-occurring dystrophin is too large to fit in an AAV. We are also developing gene therapy programs for various forms of LGMDs. Our most advanced LGMD product candidate, SRP-9003, is designed to transfer a gene that codes for and restores beta-sarcoglycan protein with the goal of restoring the dystrophin associated protein complex. SRP-9003 utilizes the AAVrh.74 vector, the same vector used in SRP-9001. Our pipeline includes more than 40 programs at various stages of discovery, pre-clinical and clinical development, reflecting our aspiration to apply our multifaceted approach and expertise in precision genetic medicine to make a profound difference in the lives of patients suffering from rare diseases. - 5 - Objectives and Business Strategy We believe that our proprietary technology platforms and collaborations can be used to develop novel pharmaceutical products to treat a broad range of diseases and address key currently-unmet medical needs. We intend to leverage our technology platforms, organizational capabilities, collaborations and resources to lead the field of precision genetic medicines, including the treatment of rare, neuromuscular and other diseases, with a diversified portfolio of product candidates. In pursuit of this objective, we intend to focus on the following activities: Core Therapeutic Areas Duchenne : We primarily focus on rapidly advancing the development of our potentially disease-modifying pipeline of exon-skipping, gene therapy and gene editing product candidates targeting Duchenne. Duchenne is a rare X-linked recessive genetic disorder affecting children (primarily males) that is characterized by progressive muscle deterioration and weakness. It is the most common type of muscular dystrophy . Duchenne is caused by an absence of dystrophin, a protein that protects muscle cells. The absence of dystrophin in muscle cells leads to significant cell damage and ultimately causes muscle cell death and fibrotic replacement. In the absence of dystrophin protein, affected individuals generally experience the following symptoms, although disease severity and life expectancy vary: LGMDs are autosomal recessive, monogenic, rare neuromuscular diseases caused by missense and deletion mutations. These diseases affect males and females equally. Some types of LGMDs affect skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle. More severe forms of LGMDs mimic Duchenne. LGMDs as a class affect an estimated range of approximately 1 in every 14,500 to 1 in every 123,000 individuals. Currently, there are no available treatment options for LGMDs. Charcot-Marie-Tooth (“CMT”) Disease is a g roup of hereditary, degenerative nerve diseases that are caused by mutations in genes that produce proteins involved in the structure and function of either the peripheral nerve axon or the myelin sheath. CMT can cause degeneration of motor skills, resulting in muscle weakness, and limiting patients’ ability to walk or use their hands, and in some cases, can cause degeneration of sensory nerves, resulting in a reduced ability to feel heat, cold, and pain. CMT affects approximately 1 in every 2,500 individuals, while CMT type 1A, which is most often caused by an extra copy of the PMP22 gene, affects approximately 50,000 patients in the U.S. Most patients are diagnosed at infancy, while other patients develop symptoms at adolescence. Currently, there are no available treatment options. - 6 - Our Commercial Products EXONDYS 51 , our first commercial product, approved by the FDA on September 19, 2016, is indicated for the treatment of Duchenne in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene that is amenable to exon 51 skipping. EXONDYS 51 uses our PMO chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 51 of the dystrophin gene. PMO-based compounds are synthetic compounds that bind to complementary sequences of RNA by standard Watson-Crick nucleobase pairing. The two key structural differences between PMO-based compounds and naturally occurring RNA are that the PMO nucleobases are bound to synthetic morpholino rings instead of ribose rings, and the morpholino rings are linked by phosphorodiamidate groups instead of phosphodiester groups. Replacement of the negatively charged phosphodiester in RNA with the uncharged phosphorodiamidate group in PMO eliminates linkage ionization at physiological pH. Due to these modifications, PMO-based compounds are resistant to degradation by plasma and intracellular enzymes. Unlike the RNA-targeted technologies such as siRNAs and DNA gapmers, PMO-based compounds operate by steric blockade rather than by cellular enzymatic degradation to achieve their biological effects. Thus, PMOs use a fundamentally different mechanism from other RNA-targeted technologies. EXONDYS 51 targets the most frequent series of mutations that cause Duchenne. Approximately 13% of Duchenne patients are amenable to exon 51 skipping. We are in the process of conducting various EXONDYS 51 clinical trials, including studies that are required to comply with our post-marketing FDA requirements and commitments to verify and describe the clinical benefit of EXONDYS 51. VYONDYS 53 , our second commercial product, approved by the FDA on December 12, 2019, is indicated for the treatment of Duchenne in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene that is amenable to exon 53 skipping. VYONDYS 53 uses our PMO chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 53 of the dystrophin gene. VYONDYS 53 has the potential to offer treatment to up to 8% of Duchenne patients who are amenable to exon 53 skipping. We are in the process of conducting various VYONDYS 53 clinical trials, including studies that are required to comply with our post-marketing FDA requirements and commitments to verify and describe the clinical benefit of VYONDYS 53. AMONDYS 45 , our third commercial product, approved by the FDA on February 25, 2021, is indicated for the treatment of Duchenne in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene that is amenable to exon 45 skipping. AMONDYS 45 uses our PMO chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 45 of the dystrophin gene. AMONDYS 45 has the potential to offer treatment to up to 8% of Duchenne patients who are amenable to exon 45 skipping. We are in the process of conducting various AMONDYS 45 clinical trials, including studies that are required to comply with our post-marketing FDA requirements and commitments to verify and describe the clinical benefit of AMONDYS 45. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded net revenues of $612.4 million, $455.9 million and $380.8 million, respectively, related to the sale of our products. Our Pipeline – Key Programs SRP-5051 uses our next-generation chemistry platform, PPMO, and our exon-skipping technology to skip exon 51 of the dystrophin gene. The PPMO technology features covalent attachment of a cell-penetrating peptide to a PMO with the goal of enhanced delivery into the cell. In pre-clinical research, our proprietary class of PPMO compounds demonstrated an increase in dystrophin production and a more durable response compared to PMO. In addition, PPMO treatment in non-human primates results in high levels of exon-skipping in skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle tissues. Pre-clinical trials also indicate that PPMOs may require less frequent dosing than PMOs, and that PPMOs could potentially be tailored to reach other organs beyond muscle. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we commenced a first-in-human, single ascending dose, trial for the treatment of Duchenne using SRP-5051 in patients who are amenable to exon 51 skipping. In 2019, we commenced a multiple ascending dose study for the treatment of Duchenne with SRP-5051 in patients who are amenable to exon 51 skipping (“Study 5051-201”). In December 2020, we announced an interim analysis on clinical results from the 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg dose cohorts of Part A of Study 5051-201. In May 2021, we announced results from the 30 mg/kg cohort of Part A of Study 5051-201. We initiated Part B of Study 5051-201 in the fourth quarter of 2021 and are currently enrolling patients. SRP-9001 (Duchenne, micro-dystrophin gene therapy program) aims to express micro-dystrophin – a smaller but still functional version of dystrophin. A unique, engineered micro-dystrophin is used because naturally-occurring dystrophin is too large to fit in an AAV vector. SRP-9001 employs the AAVrh.74 vector, which is designed to be systemically and robustly delivered to skeletal, diaphragm and cardiac muscle without promiscuously crossing the blood brain barrier, which we believe makes it a strong candidate to treat peripheral neuromuscular diseases. An MHCK7 promoter was chosen for its ability to robustly express in the heart, - 7 - which is critically important for patients with Duchenne, who typically die from pulmonary or cardiac complications. Lastly, the transgene was designed to maintain spectrin-like repeats 2 and 3, which has been reported to be critical to maintaining muscle force. In the fourth quarter of 2017, an investigational new drug (“IND”) application for the micro-dystrophin gene therapy program was cleared by the FDA, and a Phase 1/2a clinical trial in individuals with Duchenne was initiated (Study 101). In October 2018, Nationwide Children’s Hospital (“Nationwide”) presented updated results from Study 101 in four individuals with Duchenne enrolled in the trial. In March 2019, we presented nine-month functional and CK data from baseline from these four individuals, and twelve-month CK data from baseline from one of these individuals. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we commenced a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of SRP-9001 with the goal to establish the functional benefits of micro-dystrophin expressions (Study 102). In January 2021, we released top-line results for Part 1 of Study 102 (the 48-week assessment of the 41 participants) and interim expression results from Part 2 of Study 102 (the crossover phase). We announced topline results for Part 2 of Study 102 in January 2022. In May 2021, we announced 12-week expression and safety results from the first 11 participants enrolled in Study 103, an open-label study evaluating the safety and expression of commercially representative material for SRP-9001 (Study 103). In October 2021, we announced functional data from the first 11 patients and tolerability data for all 32 patients enrolled in Study 103. We also initiated our pivotal trial of SRP-9001 for the treatment of Duchenne (Study 301) in October 2021 and are currently enrolling patients. We expect to announce additional data for SRP-9001 in 2022. SRP-9003 (LGMD, gene therapy program) . We are developing gene therapy programs for various types of LGMDs. Our LGMD programs use the AAVrh.74 vector, the same vector used in the micro-dystrophin gene therapy program, to transfect a restorative gene. The most advanced of our LGMD product candidates, SRP-9003, aims to treat LGMD2E, also known as beta-sarcoglycanopathy, a severe and debilitating form of LGMD characterized by progressive muscle fiber loss, inflammation and muscle fiber replacement with fat and fibrotic tissue. SRP-9003 is designed to transfect a gene that codes for and restores beta-sarcoglycan protein with the goal of restoring the dystrophin associated protein complex. SRP-9003 has generated positive pre-clinical safety and efficacy data utilizing the AAVrh.74 vector. A Phase 1/2a trial of SRP-9003 was commenced in the fourth quarter of 2018. In February 2019, we announced two-month biopsy data from the first three-patient cohort dosed in the SRP-9003 trial, and in October 2019, we announced nine-month functional data from these three patients. In June 2020, we announced safety and expression results from three clinical trial participants in the high-dose cohort measured at 60 days, and one-year functional data from three clinical trial participants in the high-dose cohort, and eighteen-month functional data from three clinical trial participants in the low-dose cohort. We also announced one-year functional data in the high-dose cohort and two-year functional data in the low-dose cohort in March 2021. We expect to complete GMP runs for SRP-9003 in 2022. We also plan to meet with the FDA in 2022 to discuss our pivotal trial. - 8 - The chart below summarizes the status of our programs, including those with our strategic partners: - 9 - Manufacturing, Supply and Distribution We have developed proprietary state-of-the-art Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (“CMC”) and manufacturing capabilities that allow manufacturing and testing of our products and product candidates to support both clinical development as well as commercialization. We continue to refine and optimize our manufacturing processes. We have entered into certain manufacturing and supply arrangements with third-party suppliers which will in part utilize these capabilities to support production of certain of our product candidates and their components. In 2017, we opened a facility in Andover, Massachusetts, which significantly enhanced our research and development manufacturing capabilities. However, we currently do not have internal large-scale Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMP”) manufacturing capabilities to produce our products and product candidates for commercial and/or clinical use. For our current and future manufacturing needs, we have entered into supply agreements with specialized contract manufacturing organizations (each a “CMO”) to produce custom raw materials, the active pharmaceutical ingredients (“APIs”), drug product and finished goods for our products and product candidates for both commercial and clinical use. All of our CMO partners have extensive technical expertise, GMP experience and experience manufacturing our specific technology. For our commercial Duchenne program, we have worked with our existing CMOs to increase product capacity from mid-scale to large-scale. While there are a limited number of companies that can produce raw materials and APIs in the quantities and with the quality and purity that we require for our commercial products, based on our diligence to date, we believe our current network of CMOs are able to fulfill these requirements, and are capable of expanding capacity as needed. Additionally, we have, and will continue to evaluate further relationships with additional suppliers to increase overall capacity as well as further reduce risks associated with reliance on a limited number of suppliers for manufacturing. Our commercial products are distributed in the U.S. through a limited network of home infusion specialty pharmacy providers that deliver the medication to patients and a specialty distributor that distributes our products to hospitals and hospital outpatient clinics. With respect to the pre-commercial distribution of our products to patients outside of the U.S., we have contracted with third party distributors and service providers to distribute our products in certain countries through our EAPs. We plan to continue building out our network for commercial distribution in jurisdictions in which our products are approved. Our gene therapy manufacturing capabilities have been greatly enhanced through partnerships with Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (“Thermo”), Catalent, Inc. (“Catalent”) and Aldevron LLC (“Aldevron”). We have adopted a hybrid development and manufacturing strategy in which we are building internal manufacturing expertise relative to all aspects of AAV-based manufacturing, including gene therapy and gene editing supply, while closely partnering with first-in-class manufacturing partners to expedite development and commercialization of our gene therapy programs. We expect that our partnerships with Thermo and Catalent will support our clinical and commercial manufacturing capacity for our micro-dystrophin Duchenne program and LGMD programs, while also acting as a manufacturing platform for potential future gene therapy programs. The collaboration integrates process development, clinical production and testing, and commercial manufacturing. Aldevron is expected to provide GMP-grade plasmid for our SRP-9001 micro-dystrophin Duchenne program and LGMD programs, as well as plasmid source material for future gene therapy programs, such as CMT and other neuromuscular and CNS related disorders. Manufacturers and suppliers of our commercial products and product candidates are subject to the FDA’s current GMP (“cGMP”) requirements and other rules and regulations prescribed by foreign regulatory authorities. We d epend on our third-party partners for continued compliance with cGMP requirements and applicable foreign standards. Material Agreements We believe that our RNA-targeted and gene therapy technologies could be broadly applicable for the potential development of pharmaceutical products in many therapeutic areas. To enhance and further exploit our core technologies, we have and may continue to enter into research, development or commercialization alliances with universities, hospitals, independent research centers, non-profit organizations, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and other entities for new technologies, including for specific molecular targets or selected disease indications. We may also selectively pursue opportunities to access certain intellectual property rights that complement our internal portfolio through license agreements or other arrangements. Roche License, Collaboration, and Option Agreement On December 21, 2019, we entered into a License, Collaboration, and Option Agreement (the “Collaboration Agreement”) with F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd (“Roche”) pursuant to which we granted Roche an exclusive license under certain of our intellectual property rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize SRP-9001 in all countries outside of the U.S. We retained all rights to SRP-9001 in the U.S. The transaction closed on February 4, 2020. We have entered into Amendments 1 through 8 to the Collaboration Agreement on: October 23, 2020, October 28, 2020, February 4, 2021, June 23, 2021, August 31, 2021, November 30, 2021, January 5, 2022, and January 28, 2022, respectively. - 10 - Also, under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, Roche granted us a license to use certain of its intellectual property rights to perform development activities worldwide under a joint global development plan, commercialize SRP-9001 in the U.S., and perform certain manufacturing and medical affairs activities worldwide. Such license is non-exclusive under Roche’s background intellectual property rights, exclusive in the U.S. under intellectual property rights developed by Roche under the Collaboration Agreement, and non-exclusive outside the U.S. under intellectual property rights developed by Roche under the Collaboration Agreement. We intend to manufacture and supply all clinical and, upon approval in the relevant market, commercial supply of SRP-9001. Roche Options and Negotiation Rights Pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, we granted Roche an exclusive option to obtain an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize the following products outside of the U.S.: (i) certain exon-skipping products that target the dystrophin gene to induce exon skipping, including eteplirsen, golodirsen, casimersen and SRP-5051; (ii) certain gene therapy products other than SRP-9001 that encode and directly express dystrophin or a derivative thereof; and (iii) certain gene-editing products that modify, repair, or activate an endogenous dysfunctional dystrophin gene. The products subject to Roche’s options are collectively referred to as the “Option Products.” Upon option exercise, the Option Product that is the subject of the option exercise will be included under the Collaboration Agreement as a product licensed to Roche subject to similar obligations, including with respect to development, manufacturing, commercialization, and cost-sharing as those that apply to SRP-9001. Pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, Roche has a right of first negotiation if we seek to grant a third-party license to commercialize SRP-9001 in the U.S. Roche had a similar right of first negotiation with respect to our LGMDs products, but such right has expired. Exclusivity Other than under the Collaboration Agreement, Roche may not perform any clinical trials for, or commercialize, any gene therapy product, gene-editing product, or antisense oligonucleotide for Duchenne for a period of five years following the execution of the Collaboration Agreement. The exclusivity period for one or more types of products may be extended if Roche exercises its option with respect to one or more exon-skipping products, gene therapy products, or gene-editing products, in each case, for a period of five years from the time of option exercise. Development The parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct development activities with respect to SRP-9001 under the Collaboration Agreement pursuant to agreed-upon development plans. Subject to certain exceptions, we will perform all development activities directed to obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for SRP-9001 in the U.S. and the EU, as set forth in a joint global development plan. Subject to certain exceptions, the parties will share the costs of the development activities under such joint global development plan. Roche will have sole responsibility to perform all development activities set forth in a territory-specific development plan for SRP-9001, including additional activities not set forth in the joint global development plan that are specifically directed to obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for SRP-9001 outside of the U.S. Roche will be solely responsible for costs arising from the territory-specific development plan for SRP-9001. Governance Governing committees will facilitate collaboration between the parties with respect to development, manufacturing, medical affairs, intellectual property protection, and commercialization of SRP-9001 and any other licensed products. Financial Terms In consideration for the rights that we granted and for prepaid funding for development activities, in February 2020, Roche and Roche Finance Ltd, an affiliate of Roche (“Roche Finance”), together paid us an up-front payment of approximately $1.2 billion, comprised of $750.0 million in cash from Roche and approximately $400.0 million from Roche Finance in exchange for 2,522,227 shares of our common stock, priced at $158.59 per share under the Stock Purchase Agreement described below. Additionally, we are eligible to receive up to $1.7 billion in regulatory and sales milestone payments with respect to SRP-9001. In addition, the Collaboration Agreement provides that Roche will pay us royalties on net sales of SRP-9001, at a royalty rate anticipated to be in the mid-teens. - 11 - In the event that Roche chooses to exercise its option with respect to one or more Option Products, we will be paid an option exercise fee upon each such exercise and the Option Products that are the subject of the option exercise will be subject to separate milestone payments and royalties on sales of such Option Product. Term; Termination Unless earlier terminated as described below, the Collaboration Agreement will continue with respect to SRP-9001 or any Option Product for which Roche has exercised its option, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until the end of the royalty term for such product in such country. The royalty term expires on the later of (a) twelve years after first commercial sale in such country, (b) loss of regulatory exclusivity in such country and (c) expiration of all valid claims of specific licensed patents in such country. Either party may terminate the Collaboration Agreement for the other party’s material breach if such breach is not cured within a specified cure period. If Roche breaches its development or commercialization diligence obligations with respect to a licensed product or fails to develop or commercialize a particular licensed product in a particular region for a specified period of time, then we may terminate the Collaboration Agreement with respect to such licensed products in such regions. Roche may terminate the Collaboration Agreement if we fail to supply SRP-9001 to Roche in accordance with the terms of the Collaboration Agreement and the supply agreements to be entered into between the parties. Roche may also terminate the Collaboration Agreement for convenience with extended advance notice, in its entirety or on a licensed product-by-licensed product and region-by-region basis. The foregoing description of the terms of the Collaboration Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Collaboration Agreement, a copy of which is filed as an exhibit to this Annual Report. Stock Purchase Agreement On December 21, 2019, pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Roche Finance (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”) pursuant to which, in February 2020, we issued and sold 2,522,227 shares (the “Shares”) of common stock to Roche Finance in a private placement for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $400.0 million, or $158.59 per share, with a fair value of $316.3 million. The Stock Purchase Agreement contains other customary terms and conditions, including mutual representations, warranties, and covenants. Myonexus On May 3, 2018, we purchased from Myonexus, a privately-held Delaware corporation, a warrant to purchase common stock of Myonexus (the “Warrant”), which, in combination with amendments to the Myonexus certificate of incorporation, provided us with an exclusive option (the “Option”) to acquire Myonexus. In consideration for the Warrant, we made an up-front payment of $60.0 million to Myonexus. On February 27, 2019, we announced that we exercised the exclusive option to acquire Myonexus and, on April 4, 2019, we paid the Myonexus shareholders approximately $173.8 million and completed the acquisition of Myonexus. We are required to make contingent payments to the former shareholders of Myonexus upon achievement of a threshold amount of net sales of Myonexus products and the receipt and subsequent sale of a Priority Review Voucher (“PRV”) with respect to a Myonexus product. BioMarin License Agreement On July 17, 2017, we executed a License Agreement (as amended on April 14, 2019 and November 17, 2021, the “License Agreement”) with BioMarin Leiden Holding BV, BioMarin Nederlands BV and BioMarin Technologies BV (collectively, “BioMarin”), pursuant to which BioMarin granted us a royalty-bearing, worldwide license under patent rights (“Licensed Patents”) and know-how (“Licensed Know-How”) controlled by BioMarin with respect to BioMarin’s Duchenne program, which are potentially necessary or useful for the treatment of Duchenne, to practice and exploit the Licensed Patents and Licensed Know-How in all fields of use and for all purposes, including to develop and commercialize antisense oligonucleotide products that target one or more exons of the dystrophin gene to induce exon skipping, including eteplirsen, golodirsen and casimersen (collectively, the “Products”). - 12 - The license granted to Sarepta by BioMarin is co-exclusive with BioMarin, with respect to the Licensed Patents, and is non-exclusive with respect to Licensed Know-How. Pursuant to the amendment to the License Agreement dated November 17, 2021 (“2021 Amendment”), BioMarin exercised its right to convert the exclusive license under the Licensed Patents to the current co-exclusive license. Under the terms of the License Agreement, we were required to pay BioMarin an up-front payment of $15.0 million. Pursuant to the 2021 Amendment, BioMarin is eligible to receive up to $20.0 million from us per dystrophin gene exon (other than exon 51) targeted by one or more Products in specified regulatory milestones, as well as an additional $10.0 million milestone, payable following the regulatory approval of eteplirsen by the EMA. BioMarin is also eligible to receive through June 30, 2022 royalties segmented by specified geographic markets, in some jurisdictions dependent on the existence of a patent, ranging from 4% to 8% of net sales on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis. Beginning July 1, 2022, pursuant to the 2021 Amendment, BioMarin is eligible to receive royalties of 4% in the U.S. and 5% outside the U.S. of net sales of Products covered by a Licensed Patent on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis. Milestones and royalties are payable with respect to eteplirsen (an exon 51 skipping Product), golodirsen (an exon 53 skipping Product), casimersen (an exon 45 skipping Product) through June 30, 2022. Beginning July 1, 2022, pursuant to the 2021 Amendment, milestones and royalties are payable only with respect to Products covered by a Licensed Patent. Beginning July 1, 2022, pursuant to the 2021 Amendment, the royalty term applicable to Products covered by a Licensed Patent will expire upon March 31, 2024 in the U.S. and December 31, 2024 outside the U.S. The royalties for all Products covered by a Licensed Patent are subject to reductions, including for generic competition and, under specified conditions, for a specified portion of payments that we may become required to pay under third-party license agreements, subject to a maximum royalty reduction. Unless earlier terminated, the License Agreement will expire upon the expiration of the last-to-expire royalty term. Either party may terminate the License Agreement in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach. BioMarin may also terminate the License Agreement on a Licensed Patent-by-Licensed Patent basis under specified circumstances relating to patent challenges by us. Settlement Agreement On July 17, 2017, Sarepta and The University of Western Australia (“UWA”) on the one hand, and the BioMarin Parties and Academisch Ziekenhuis Leiden (“AZL”) on the other hand (collectively, the “Settlement Parties”), executed a Settlement Agreement pursuant to which all legal actions in the U.S. and certain legal actions in Europe (the “Actions”) would be stopped or withdrawn as between the Settlement Parties. Specifically, the terms of the Settlement Agreement required that existing efforts pursuing ongoing litigation and opposition proceedings would be stopped as between the Settlement Parties, and the Settlement Parties would cooperate to withdraw the Actions before the European Patent Office (except for actions involving third parties), the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the High Court of Justice of England and Wales, except for the cross-appeal of the Interlocutory Decision of the Opposition Division dated April 15, 2013 of the European Patent Office of EP 1619249B1 (“EP ‘249 Appeal”) in which Sarepta agreed to withdraw its appeal and BioMarin/AZL agreed to continue with its appeal with Sarepta having oversight of the continued appeal by BioMarin/AZL. Additionally, under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the Settlement Parties agreed to release each other and the customers, end-users, agents, suppliers, distributors, resellers, contractors, consultants, services and partners of Sarepta or BioMarin (as applicable) from claims and damages related to (i) the patent rights controlled by the releasing party that are involved in the Actions, (ii) with respect to Sarepta and UWA, its patent rights related to the patent rights involved in the Actions, and (iii) with respect to BioMarin and AZL, all of the Licensed Patents and Licensed Know-How. Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Sarepta made an up-front payment of $20.0 million to BioMarin. University of Western Australia In April 2013, we entered into an agreement with UWA under which an existing exclusive license agreement between the two parties was amended and restated and, in June 2016, we entered into the first amendment to the license agreement (the “UWA License Agreement”). The UWA License Agreement grants us specific rights to compounds for the treatment of Duchenne by inducing exon skipping. EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53 and AMONDYS 45 fall under the scope of the license agreement. Under the UWA License Agreement, we are required to make payments of up to $6.0 million in the aggregate to UWA based on the successful achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones relating to EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53, AMONDYS 45 and up to three additional product candidates. As of December 31, 202 1, $4.2 million of the $6.0 million development and regulatory milestone payments had been made. We are also obligated to make payments to UWA of up to $20.0 million upon the achievement of certain - 13 - sales milestones. Additionally, we are required to pay a low-single-digit percentage royalty on net sales of products covered by issued patents licensed from UWA during the term of the UWA License Agreement. Currently, the latest date on which an issued patent covered by the UWA License Agreement expires is November 2030 (excluding any patent term extension, supplemental protection certificate or pediatric extensions that may be available); however, patents granted from pending patent applications could result in a later expiration date. Key Strategic Alliances In connection with our multi-front battle against Duchenne and other rare neuromuscular diseases, we have entered into multiple partnering opportunities, including the ones described below. We believe that these collaborations, taken along with our own programs, represent a comprehensive approach to treating these rare neuromuscular diseases. Nationwide Children’s Hospital In December 2015, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Nationwide to acquire exclusive rights to its GALGT2 gene therapy program for neuromuscular related disorders. In addition, in December 2016, we entered into an exclusive option agreement with Nationwide to acquire exclusive rights to their micro-dystrophin gene therapy program as well as a sponsored research agreement to conduct pre-IND research and conduct the first clinical trial with the lead micro-dystrophin gene therapy. In October 2018, we exercised our exclusive license option and an option under the sponsored research agreement and entered into an exclusive license agreement with Nationwide to acquire exclusive rights to its micro-dystrophin gene therapy program, which provides us with exclusive rights to commercialize SRP-9001. Furthermore, in October 2018, we entered into an exclusive option agreement with Nationwide with respect to exclusive rights to its NT-3 gene therapy program for the treatment of certain CMT neuropathy subtypes, including CMT Type 1A. The option agreement contains pre-determined economic terms for the exclusive license to be entered into upon us exercising our option. In addition, in March 2019, we entered into an exclusive option agreement with Nationwide with respect to exclusive rights to its calpain-3 gene therapy program for the treatment of LGMD Type 2A. In July 2021, we exercised our option and entered into an exclusive license agreement with Nationwide to acquire exclusive rights to its calpain-3 gene therapy program for the treatment of LGMD Type 2A. Duke University In October 2017, we entered into a sponsored research and exclusive option agreement with Duke University, granting us an exclusive option to an exclusive license to intellectual property and technology related to certain CRISPR/Cas9 technology developed in the laboratory of Charles A. Gersbach, Ph.D. The underlying premise of Dr. Gersbach’s approach is to restore dystrophin expression by removing or “excising” exons from the dystrophin gene. This includes a strategy to excise exons potentially enabling treatment for a majority of the Duchenne patient population. Genethon In May 2017, we entered into a sponsored research agreement with Genethon, under which we have been collaborating with Genethon on the pre-clinical development of its micro-dystrophin gene therapy products for the treatment of Duchenne. In November 2019, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Genethon, under which we will collaborate and share costs with Genethon on the clinical development of such products for the treatment of Duchenne. Under such agreement, we received the exclusive right to commercialize such products in the majority of the world (primarily excluding the EU). For the rights we received under such agreement, we made an up-front payment of $28.0 million; may be required to pay up to $236.3 million in development, regulatory and sales milestones; and upon commercialization, will be required to make tiered royalty payments based on net sales of licensed products. StrideBio On November 13, 2019, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with StrideBio, Inc. (“StrideBio”), a leading developer of novel AAV capsids, to develop in vivo AAV-based therapies for up to eight CNS and neuromuscular targets. Pursuant to the agreement, we were granted an exclusive license on selected targets to leverage StrideBio’s capsid technology intended to enhance specific tropism to tissues of interest and evade neutralizing antibodies. StrideBio will conduct all IND enabling research, development and manufacturing for the first four CNS targets, which are MECP2 (Rett syndrome), SCN1A (Dravet syndrome), UBE3A (Angelman syndrome), and NPC1 (Niemann-Pick). - 14 - Under the terms of the agreement, StrideBio will be responsible for AAV capsid development, non-clinical development and manufacturing of preclinical candidates to be selected for advancement into clinical studies. The parties will also share early clinical development activities for certain selected targets, with Sarepta responsible for late stage development and commercialization of all targets. StrideBio received up-front consideration of $46.9 million, of which $29.4 million was in the form of Sarepta common stock and the balance in cash. In addition, StrideBio will receive significant future development, regulatory and commercial milestones upon the achievement of specified milestone events for each of the four programs. StrideBio will also receive royalties on worldwide net sales of any commercial products developed through the collaboration. In addition, in March 2021, in accordance with the commitment made under the agreement, Sarepta invested in StrideBio’s Series B financing round. Patents and Proprietary Rights Our success depends in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain exclusivity for our products, product candidates and platform technologies. We typically rely on a combination of patent protection and regulatory exclusivity to maintain exclusivity for our products and product candidates, whereas exclusivity for our platform technologies is generally based on patent protection and trade secret protection. In addition to patent protection, regulatory exclusivity, and trade secret protection, we also protect our products, product candidates and platform technologies with copyrights, trademarks, and contractual protections. We actively seek patent protection for our product candidates and certain of our proprietary technologies by filing patent applications in the U.S. and other countries as appropriate. These patent applications are directed to various inventions, including, but not limited to, active ingredients, pharmaceutical formulations, methods of use, and manufacturing methods. In addition, we actively acquire exclusive rights to third party patents and patent applications to protect our in-licensed product candidates and corresponding platform technologies. We do not have patents or patent applications in every jurisdiction where there is a potential commercial market for our product candidates. For each of our programs, our decision to seek patent protection in specific foreign markets, in addition to the U.S., is based on many factors, including: We continually evaluate our patent portfolio and patent strategy and believe our owned and licensed patents and patent applications provide us with a competitive advantage; however, if markets where we do not have patents or patent applications become commercially important, our business may be adversely affected. A discussion of certain risks and uncertainties that may affect our freedom to operate, patent position, regulatory exclusivities and other proprietary rights is set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors included in this report, and a discussion of legal proceedings related to the key patents protecting our products and product candidates are set forth below in the footnotes to the tables in this section. Certain of our product candidates are in therapeutic areas that have been the subject of many years of extensive research and development by academic organizations and third parties who may control patents or other intellectual property that they might assert against us, should one or more of our product candidates in these therapeutic areas succeed in obtaining regulatory approval and thereafter be commercialized. We continually evaluate the intellectual property rights of others in these areas in order to determine whether a claim of infringement may be made by others against us. Should we determine that a third party has intellectual property rights that could impact our ability to freely market a compound, we consider a number of factors in determining how best to prepare for the commercialization of any such product candidate. In making this determination we consider, among other things, the stage of development of our product candidate, the anticipated date of first regulatory approval, whether we believe the intellectual property rights of others are valid, whether we believe we infringe the intellectual property rights of others, whether a license is available upon commercially reasonable terms, whether we will seek to challenge the intellectual property rights of others, the term of the rights, and the likelihood of and liability resulting from an adverse outcome should we be found to infringe the intellectual property rights of others. - 15 - Currently, U.S. patents, as well as most foreign patents, are generally effective for 20 years from the date the earliest regular application was filed. In some countries, the patent term may be extended to recapture a portion of the term lost during regulatory review of the claimed therapeutic. For example, in the U.S., under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may be eligible for patent term extension (for up to 5 years, but not beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval) as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. In the U.S., only one patent may be extended for any product based on FDA delay. In addition to patent term extension, patents in the U.S. may be granted additional term due to delays at the USPTO during prosecution of a patent application. We actively strive to maximize the potential for patent protection for our products and product candidates in accordance with the law. Key Patents & Regulatory Exclusivities Our products, product candidates and our technologies are primarily protected by composition of matter and methods of use patents and patent applications. A summary of granted composition of matter and/or methods of use patents that we solely own or control (or in the case of BioMarin/AZL patents, control with BioMarin), which cover our products in the U.S. and Europe, is provided below. To the extent the product indicated above the tables that immediately follow the name of such product is covered by a patent that is licensed to Sarepta, we may owe milestones and/or royalties to the indicated licensor in connection with the development and/or commercial sale of the product.

In connection with its FDA approval on February 25, 2021, the FDA granted AMONDYS 45 (casimersen) NCE exclusivity until February 25, 2026, and Orphan Drug Exclusivity until February 25, 2028. * Granted patents in the U.S. and Europe (EP) are shown here. Additional patent protection in the U.S., Europe (EP) or other countries or regions through pending or granted foreign counterparts may be available. ** Stated expiration dates do not account for any patent term extension, supplemental protection certificate or pediatric extensions that may be available. In addition to the foregoing composition of matter and method of use patents that protect eteplirsen, casimersen and golodirsen, we either solely own or control (or in the case of BioMarin/AZL patents, control with BioMarin) patents and patent applications in the U.S. and in major foreign markets that, if granted, provide additional protection for eteplirsen, casimersen, and golodirsen, which cover the composition of matter, preparation and/or uses of the products. These patents, and patent applications, if granted, would expire through at least 2038, such expiration dates not accounting for any patent term extension, patent term adjustment, supplemental protection certificate or pediatric extensions that may be available. Platform Technologies We separately own patents and patent applications in the U.S. and in major foreign markets that cover our proprietary PMO-based platform technologies (e.g., PPMO) relevant to our products. These patents, and patent applications, if granted, expire through at least 2038, such expiration dates not accounting for any patent term extension, supplemental protection certificate or pediatric extensions that may be available. Trademarks Our trademarks are important to us and are generally filed to protect our corporate brand, our products and platform technologies. We typically file trademark applications and pursue their registration in the U.S., Europe and other markets in which we anticipate using such trademarks. We are the owner of multiple federal trademark registrations in the U.S. including, but not limited to, Sarepta, Sarepta Therapeutics, the double-helix logo, EXONDYS, EXONDYS 51, the EXONDYS 51 Logo, VYONDYS, VYONDYS 53, the VYONDYS 53 Logo, AMONDYS, AMONDYS 45, and the AMONDYS 45 Logo. In addition, we have multiple pending trademark applications and registrations in the U.S. and in major foreign markets. Trademark protection varies in accordance with local law, and continues in some countries as long as the trademark is used and in other countries as long as the trademark is registered. Trademark registrations generally are for fixed but renewable terms. Government Regulation The testing, manufacturing, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, exportation and marketing of our products are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S. and in other countries. In the U.S., the FDA, under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations, regulates pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending marketing applications, withdrawal of approval of approved products, warning letters, untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, civil penalties and/or criminal prosecution. - 18 - U.S. Drug Approval Process To obtain FDA approval of a product candidate, we must, among other things, submit clinical data providing substantial evidence of safety and efficacy of the product for its intended use, as well as detailed information on product composition, its manufacture and controls and proposed labeling. The testing and collection of data and the preparation of necessary applications are expensive and time-consuming. The FDA may not act quickly or favorably in reviewing these applications, and we may encounter significant difficulties or costs in our efforts to obtain FDA approvals that could delay or preclude us from marketing our products. The steps required before a drug may be approved for marketing in the U.S. generally include the following: Pre-clinical trials may include laboratory evaluations of the product chemistry, pharmacology, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the pharmacokinetics, metabolism, bio-distribution, elimination and toxicity of the product candidate. The conduct of the pre-clinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with federal regulations and requirements. The results of the pre-clinical trials, manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed first in human clinical trial protocol are submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may be initiated. The IND will become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions about the supportive data, or the study design, particularly regarding potential safety issues with conducting the clinical trial as described in the protocol. In this situation, the trials are placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns before clinical trials can proceed. Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patient participants under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the study, the administration of the investigational product, subject selection and exclusion criteria, study procedures, parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as a submission to the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”) requirements and federal and state laws and regulations protecting study subjects. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) at or servicing each institution in which the clinical trial will be conducted. The IRB will consider, among other things, rationale for conducting the trial, clinical trial design, participant informed consent, ethical factors, the safety and rights of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution. The FDA can temporarily or permanently halt a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial subjects. The IRB may also require the clinical trial at a particular site be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with GCP or the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions. - 19 - Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential drug development phases (Phases 1, 2 and 3) prior to approval, and a portion of these phases may overlap. A fourth post-approval phase (Phase 4) may include additional clinical trials. A general description of clinical trials conducted in each phase of development is provided below. However, the number of study subjects involved in each phase of drug development for rare diseases can be significantly less than typically expected for more common diseases with larger patient populations: A company seeking marketing approval for a new drug in the U.S. must submit the results of the pre-clinical and clinical trials to the FDA in the form of a marketing application, together with, among other things, detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product candidate and proposed labeling, including payment of a user fee for FDA review of the application. The user fee is waived for an application for a product intended to treat an Orphan Indication. The FDA assesses all submitted marketing applications for completeness before it accepts them for filing. In some cases, the FDA may request additional information before accepting a marketing application for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the marketing application. Applications receive either standard or priority review. Under the current goals mandated under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (the “PDUFA”), the FDA has ten months in which to complete its initial review of a standard marketing application and respond to the applicant, and six months for a priority marketing application. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard or priority marketing applications. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the marketing application sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date. The FDA may refer an application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. Though the FDA is not bound by such recommendations, it considers them carefully when making decisions. If the FDA’s evaluations of the marketing application and the clinical and manufacturing procedures and facilities are favorable, the FDA may issue an approval letter. If the FDA finds deficiencies in the marketing application, it may issue a complete response letter, which defines the conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the marketing application. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will issue an approval letter, authorizing commercial marketing of the drug. Sponsors that receive a complete response letter may submit to the FDA information that represents a complete response to the issues identified by the FDA. Resubmissions by the marketing application sponsor in response to a complete response letter trigger new review periods of varying length (typically two to six months) based on the content of the resubmission. If the FDA’s evaluation of the marketing application and the commercial manufacturing procedures and facilities is not favorable, the FDA may not approve the marketing application. - 20 - A sponsor may also seek designation of its drug candidates under programs designed to accelerate the FDA’s review and potential approval of marketing applications. For instance, a sponsor may seek FDA designation of a drug candidate as a “fast track product.” Fast track products are those products intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. If fast track designation is obtained, the FDA may initiate early and frequent communication and begin reviewing sections of a marketing application before the application is complete. This “rolling review” is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the remaining information. Eteplirsen was granted fast track status in 2007. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (“FDASIA”) enacted and signed into law in 2012 amended the criteria for the fast track and accelerated approval pathways and, as a result, the pathways now share many common eligibility criteria. FDASIA provides both the sponsor companies and the FDA with greater flexibility and expedited regulatory mechanisms. The statute clarifies that a fast track product may be approved pursuant to an accelerated approval (Subpart – H) or under the traditional approval process. In addition, FDASIA codified the accelerated approval pathway as separate and apart from the fast track pathway, meaning that for drugs to be eligible for accelerated approval, they do not need to be designated under the fast track pathway. FDASIA reinforces the FDA’s authority to grant accelerated approval of a drug that treats a serious condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies and demonstrates an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality (“IMM”) that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit (i.e., an intermediate clinical endpoint). Approvals of this kind typically include requirements for appropriate post-approval Phase 4 clinical trials to confirm clinical benefit. FDASIA retains this requirement and further requires those studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. Additionally, FDASIA established a new, expedited regulatory mechanism referred to as breakthrough therapy designation. Breakthrough therapy designation, fast track, and accelerated approval are not mutually exclusive and are meant to serve different purposes. The breakthrough therapy designation is focused on expediting the development and review process and by itself does not create an alternate ground for product approval. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of a drug candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the drug is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA issued guidance entitled “Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions––Drugs and Biologics” in May 2014. Finally, if a drug candidate demonstrates a significant benefit over existing therapy, it may be eligible for priority review, which means it will be reviewed within a six-month timeframe from the date a complete marketing application is accepted for filing. A Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (“RMAT”) designation is also designed to accelerate approval for regenerative advanced therapies such as our gene therapy product candidates, but the exact mechanisms have not yet been announced by FDA. We cannot be sure that any of our drug candidates will qualify for any of these expedited development, review and approval programs, or that, if a drug does qualify, that the product candidates will be approved, will be accepted as part of any such program or that the review time will be shorter than a standard review. Holders of an approved marketing application are required to: The FDA periodically inspects the sponsor’s records related to safety reporting and/or manufacturing; this latter effort includes assessment of compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved marketing application, including withdrawal of the product from the market. - 21 - Foreign Regulatory Requirements In November 2016, we submitted a marketing authorization application (“MAA”) for eteplirsen to the EMA and the application was validated in December 2016. As we announced on June 1, 2018, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) within the EMA adopted a negative opinion for eteplirsen. In September 2018, the CHMP confirmed its negative opinion for eteplirsen, and the European Commission adopted the CHMP opinion in December 2018. As of the date of this Annual Report, EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53 and AMONDYS 45 have only been approved for sale and marketing in the U.S. by the FDA, and EXONDYS 51 has been approved in addition for sale and marketing in Israel by the Israeli Ministry of Health. Thus, in addition to regulations in the U.S., our business is subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Irrespective of whether it concerns an FDA approved or investigational drug, the commencement of clinical trials and the subsequent marketing of a drug product in foreign countries are subject to preliminary approvals from the corresponding regulatory authorities of such countries. For example, until the entry into application of the Clinical Trial Regulation 536/2014 and the end of the transition period (see below) the conduct of clinical trials in the EU is still governed by the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC laying down the requirements for the conduct of clinical trials in the EU and the principles and guidelines on GCP. Both Directives provide a system for the approval of clinical trials, which has been implemented through national legislation in the member states of the EU (“EU Member States”). Under this system, a sponsor must obtain approval from the competent national authority of an EU Member State in which the clinical trial is to be conducted, or in multiple EU Member States if the clinical trial is to be conducted in a number of countries. Furthermore, the sponsor may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. The Clinical Trials Application (“CTA”) must include the supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC, corresponding national laws of the EU Member States, and as further detailed in the applicable guidance documents. In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. Although the new Clinical Trials Regulation had been adopted and had entered into force in 2014, it would only come into application in the EU Member States six months after the EC has confirmed the functionality of the new Clinical Trials Information System (“CTIS”), which includes the centralized EU portal and database for clinical trials introduced by the Regulation. On July 31, 2021, the EC published a notice in the Official Journal of the European Union, confirming full functionality of the EU portal and database. The Regulation will hence enter into application on January 31, 2022. When the Regulation enters into application, it will repeal the currently applicable Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and its national implementation legislations. It will also apply to clinical trials that were authorized under the previous legislation if they are still ongoing three years after the Regulation has come into operation. There is a three-year transition period after entry into application of the Clinical Trials Regulation. During the first year, until January 31, 2023, sponsors of clinical trials will be able to choose whether to file a CTA under the regime of the Directive, using the EudraCT, or under the Regulation, using the CTIS. As of the second year, all new CTAs must be submitted under the Clinical Trials Regulation, via the CTIS. Clinical trials that were submitted under the Directive prior to January 31, 2023, will be allowed to continue under the old regime until the end of the transition period, but sponsors may also opt to transition ongoing trials on a voluntary basis. By January 31, 2025, all clinical trials that had been authorized under the Directive, must either have ended in the EU and European Economic Area (the “EEA”), or have been transitioned to the new regime. No legislation needs to be adopted to implement the new Regulation into national EU Member State law. The new Regulation provides an overhaul of the system, in order to harmonize the assessment of the submission and assessment of clinical trials conducted in EU Member States and to ensure greater consistency with the highest standards of patient safety in the EU. Specifically, the new legislation seeks to simplify and streamline approval of the clinical trials. Under the new coordinated procedure, the sponsor of a clinical trial is required to submit a single application to a reporting EU Member State via the centralized EU portal in the CTIS. The reporting EU Member State will consult and coordinate with all other EU Member States in which the clinical trial is planned to be conducted. If the application is rejected, it can be amended and resubmitted through the central EU portal in the CTIS. If an approval is issued, the sponsor can start the clinical trial in all EU Member States concerned. However, an EU Member State can in certain cases declare an “opt-out” from the approval. In such a case, the clinical trial cannot be conducted in such EU Member State(s). The Clinical Trials Regulation also aims to streamline and simplify the rules on safety reporting for clinical trials. In order to obtain marketing authorization for a medicinal product in the EU, applicants are required to submit a MAA to either (a) the national competent authorities (through the decentralized, mutual recognition, or national procedures) or (b) the EMA (through the centralized authorization procedure). Applicants are required to demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicinal product in the application for marketing authorization, which implies the requirement to conduct human clinical trials to generate the necessary clinical data. Furthermore, all applications for marketing authorization for new medicines have to include the results of studies as described in an agreed pediatric investigation plan (“PIP”) aimed at ensuring that the necessary data are obtained through studies in children, unless the medicine is exempt because of a deferral or waiver. Deferrals allow an applicant to delay development of the medicine in children until, for instance, there is enough information to demonstrate its effectiveness and safety in adults. Waivers, on the other hand, may be granted when the development of a medicine in children is not needed or is not appropriate, such as for diseases that only affect the adult population. Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down the rules applicable to the centralized procedure for the authorization of medicinal products. The centralized procedure allows pharmaceutical companies to submit a single application to the EMA, which is followed by a single evaluation and which results in a single approval to market the medicinal product throughout the EEA, on the basis of a single market authorization. Approval via the centralized procedure is a two-step process whereby the CHMP first evaluates the MAA and issues an opinion on - 22 - whether the medicinal product may be authorized or not (step 1). The CHMP opinion is subsequently sent to the EC, which takes a legally binding decision to grant a marketing authorization (step 2). The marketing authorization is valid throughout the EU and is automatically recognized in three of the four European Free Trade Association states (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). This allows the marketing authorization holder to market the medicine and make it available throughout the EEA. The timeframe for the first step of the centralized procedure (evaluation by the CHMP) opinion is 210 days from receipt of a valid application. However, the actual time needed to complete this first step is generally longer than the 210 days, since procedural clock stops are required in order for the applicant to respond to additional requests for information by the CHMP. Following a positive CHMP opinion, the EC has 67 days to issue its decision to grant the marketing authorization or not. Accelerated evaluation of the MAA under the centralized procedure is possible in exceptional cases, following a justified request from the applicant, when a medicinal product is of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The CHMP determines what constitutes a major public interest on a case-by-case basis. Justifications must include the major benefits expected and present the arguments to support the claim that the medicinal product introduces new methods of therapy or improves on existing methods, thereby addressing, to a significant extent, the greater unmet needs for maintaining and improving public health. If the applicant provides sufficient justification for an accelerated assessment, the CHMP can reduce the timeframe for review of a MAA to 150 days. The timeframe for the EC to issue its decision remains unaltered. Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 defines in which cases the centralized application procedure must (mandatory scope) or may (optional scope) be followed. The centralized procedure is mandatory for medicinal products derived from biotechnological and other high-tech processes, orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy medicinal products and products indicated for the treatment of HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions, viral diseases and neurodegenerative diseases. For medicinal products that do not fall under any of the aforementioned categories, a submission via the centralized procedure is possible, provided that it concerns (i) a new active substance or (ii) product that can demonstrate a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation and for which approval would be in the interest of public health. Given the foregoing, our portfolio of innovative orphan products for neurodegenerative diseases is subject to the mandatory centralized procedure. Innovative medicinal products which have been authorized in accordance with the centralized procedure, benefit from an eight-year period of data protection/exclusivity and a ten-year period of marketing protection/exclusivity. During the data exclusivity period, applicants for approval of generics of these innovative products cannot reference or rely upon data contained in the marketing authorization dossier submitted for the innovative medicinal product. Furthermore, the marketing protection entails that even if the generic product is approved, it cannot be placed on the market until the full ten-year period of market protection has elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference medicinal product. The marketing protection period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder for the innovative product obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Similar to the U.S., marketing authorization holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA and/or the national competent authorities of the EU Member States. This oversight applies both before and after the granting of manufacturing and marketing authorizations. It includes compliance with EU GMP and GDP rules in relation to such activities as distribution, importing and exporting of medicinal products, rules governing conduct of pharmacovigilance (including good pharmacovigilance practices (“GVP”)) and requirements governing advertising, promotion and sale of medicinal products. Failure to comply with the EU Member State laws implementing the EU Community Code on medicinal products, and EU rules governing the promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices, with the EU Member State laws that apply to the promotion of medicinal products, statutory health insurance, bribery and anti-corruption or with other applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the relevant EU Member State authorities. This may include any of the following sanctions: fines, imprisonment, orders forfeiting products or prohibiting or suspending their supply to the market, orders to suspend, vary, or withdraw the marketing authorization or requiring the manufacturer to issue public warnings, or to conduct a product recall. The approval process in other countries outside the U.S. and the EU varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for the FDA approval. In addition, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement for market access vary greatly from country to country. In all cases, clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. Data and Market Exclusivities In addition to patent exclusivities, the FDA and certain other foreign health authorities may grant data or market exclusivity for a newly approved chemical entity or biologic, which runs in parallel to any patent protection. Regulatory data protection or - 23 - exclusivity prevents a potential generic competitor from relying on clinical trial data generated by the sponsor when establishing the safety and efficacy of its competing product. Market exclusivity prohibits any marketing of the same drug for the same indication. In the U.S., the FDA will generally grant an NCE that is the subject of an NDA with five years of regulatory data exclusivity, during which time a competitor generally may not submit an application to the FDA based on a sponsor’s clinical data. A competitor, however, may file an Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”) seeking approval of a generic drug four years from the date of approval of the innovative product if it is accompanied by a so-called Paragraph IV certification. For a newly approved biologic that is the subject of a Biologics License Application (“BLA”), the FDA will generally grant 12 years of market exclusivity, during which time a competitor may not market the same drug for the same indication. In addition, the FDA may provide six months of pediatric exclusivity to a sponsor of a marketing application if the sponsor conducted a pediatric study or studies of a product. This process is applied to products developed for adult use and is initiated by the FDA as a written request for pediatric studies that applies to a sponsor’s product. If the sponsor conducts qualifying studies and the studies are accepted by the FDA, then an additional six months of pediatric exclusivity will be added to previously granted exclusivity, such as orphan drug exclusivity and NCE exclusivity, as well as certain patent-based exclusivities. Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity In the U.S., the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that drug. An orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. An orphan drug designation does not shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. The approval of an orphan designation request does not alter the regulatory requirements and process for obtaining marketing approval. Safety and efficacy of a compound must be established through adequate and well-controlled studies. If a chemical or biological product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives FDA approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is generally entitled to an orphan drug exclusivity period of seven years, which means the FDA may not grant approval to any other application to market the same chemical or biological product for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as where an alternative product demonstrates clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. In addition, holders of exclusivity for orphan drugs are expected to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of their orphan drugs to meet the needs of patients. Failure to do so could result in the withdrawal of orphan exclusivity for the drug. Competitors may receive approval of different drugs or biologics for the indications for which a prior approved orphan drug has exclusivity. Pharmaceutical companies can apply for the designation as an orphan medicine. In the EU, applications for orphan designation are evaluated by the EMA in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 141/2000. In order to qualify as an orphan medicine, the medicinal product must be intended to diagnose, prevent or treat a condition that is life-threatening or chronically debilitating, with a prevalence of no more than 5 in 10,000 people in the EU or for which it is unlikely that its sale would generate sufficient returns to justify the investment needed for its development. In addition, the sponsor is required to demonstrate that no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition has been be authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the medicinal product is of significant benefit to those affected by the condition as compared to approved methods. The benefits of being granted orphan designation are significant, including up to ten years of market exclusivity. During this ten-year period, the EMA may not accept a new marketing application for a similar medicinal product for the same therapeutic indication as the approved orphan medicinal product. Pursuant to Regulation (EC) 1901/2006 on medicinal products for pediatric use, the ten-year orphan market exclusivity can be extended to a maximum period of twelve years upon the satisfactory completion of all the key elements of the agreed PIP. We have been granted orphan drug designation for eteplirsen in the EU. Expanded / Early Access In certain countries, drug products approved in the U.S. or the EU can be accessed by patients before the drug has obtained marketing approval in such country. There are various forms of this access including, but not limited to, the actual purchase of product by the purchaser, which is often times the government for patients, on a named patient basis, and providing the product free of charge on a named patient basis for compassionate use. Each country has its own laws and regulations that apply to these forms of access and the extent and nature of such laws and regulations vary by country. For example, in 2018, the so-called Right to Try Act became law in the U.S. The law, among other things, allows eligible patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to such eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act. - 24 - We established a global EAP for eteplirsen, golodirsen and casimersen in some countries where eteplirsen, golodirsen and casimersen currently have not been approved. The EAP provides a mechanism through which physicians can prescribe our products, within their professional responsibility, to patients who meet pre-specified medical and other criteria and can secure funding. Other Regulatory Requirements In addition to regulations enforced by the FDA and foreign authorities relating to the clinical development and marketing of products, we are or may become subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and potential future foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations. Although we believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws that apply to us, we cannot predict whether new regulatory restrictions will be imposed by state or federal regulators and agencies or whether existing laws and regulations will adversely affect us in the future. While it is impossible to accurately predict the future costs associated with environmental compliance and potential remediation activities, we understand the importance of complying with all current and future applicable environmental laws and regulations. Compliance with environmental laws is not expected to require significant capital expenditures and has not had, and is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on our operations. Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws We are subject to various federal, state and local laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, including anti-kickback and false claims laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by crime or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, and/or exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). Federal and state authorities are paying increased attention to enforcement of these laws within the pharmaceutical industry, and private individuals have been active in alleging violations of the laws and bringing suits on behalf of the government under the federal False Claims Act (“FCA”). Violations of international fraud and abuse laws could result in similar penalties, including exclusion from participation in health programs outside the U.S. Given the broad scope of these laws, our activities could be subject to scrutiny under the laws. If we were subject to allegations concerning, or were convicted of violating, these laws, our business could be harmed. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute generally prohibits, among other things, a pharmaceutical manufacturer from directly or indirectly soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying any remuneration in cash or in kind where one purpose is either to induce the referral of an individual for, or the purchase or prescription of, a particular drug that is payable by a federal health care program, including Medicare or Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or a specific intent to violate the statute. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute can result in exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs as well as civil and criminal fines and penalties of up to $105,563 per violation and three times the amount of the unlawful remuneration. A claim arising from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute also constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. A new federal anti-kickback statute enacted in 2018 prohibits certain payments related to referrals of patients to certain providers (such as clinical laboratories) and applies to services reimbursed by private health plans as well as government health care programs. Federal and state false claims laws generally prohibit anyone from knowingly and willfully, among other activities, presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for drugs or services that are false or fraudulent (which may include claims for services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary services). False or fraudulent claims for purposes of the FCA carry fines and civil penalties for violations ranging from $11,803 to $23,607 for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages sustained by the federal government and, may provide the basis for exclusion from federally funded healthcare programs. There is also a criminal FCA statute by which individuals or entities that submit false claims can face criminal penalties. In addition, under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law, the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) Office of Inspector General has the authority to exclude from participation in federal health care programs or to impose civil penalties against any person who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, certain false or otherwise improper claims. A federal healthcare fraud statute prohibits the knowing and willful execution, or attempt to execute, a scheme to defraud a health care benefit program, including private health plans, or obtain, through false or fraudulent pretenses, money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, such a health care benefit program. The majority of states also have anti-kickback, false claims, and similar fraud and abuse laws and although the specific provisions of these laws vary, their scope is generally broad, and there may not be regulations, guidance or court decisions that apply the laws to particular industry practices. Laws and regulations have also been enacted by the federal government and various states to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers. The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers; require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government; and/or require disclosure to the government and/or public of financial interactions (so-called “sunshine laws”). State laws may also require disclosure of pharmaceutical pricing information and marketing expenditures. Manufacturers must also submit information to the FDA on the - 25 - identity and quantity of drug samples requested and distributed by a manufacturer during each year. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our activities could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent federal and state laws and regulations. Data Privacy and Security We may be subject to privacy and security laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate, obtain or store personally identifiable information. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business. Our ongoing efforts to comply with evolving laws and regulations may be costly and require ongoing modifications to our policies, procedures and systems. Failure to comply with laws regarding data protection would expose us to risk of enforcement actions and penalties under such laws. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. Within the U.S., there are numerous federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of personal information. For example, at the federal level, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as amended, and its implementing regulations establish privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information, or protected health information, and require the implementation of administrative, physical and technological safeguards to protect the privacy of protected health information. While we have determined that we are neither a “covered entity” nor a “business associate” directly subject to HIPAA, many of the U.S. health care providers with which we interact are subject to HIPAA, and we may have assumed obligations related to protecting the privacy of personal information. States are increasingly regulating the privacy and security of personal information. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which took effect on January 1, 2020, gives California consumers (defined to include all California residents) certain rights, including the right to ask covered companies to disclose the types of personal information collected, the categories of sources from which such information was collected, the business purpose for collecting or selling the consumer’s personal information, the categories of third parties with whom a covered company shares personal information, and specific pieces of information collected by a covered company. The CCPA imposes several obligations on covered companies to provide notice to California consumers regarding their data processing activities. The CCPA also gives California consumers the right to ask covered companies to delete a consumer’s personal information and it places limitations on a covered company’s ability to sell personal information, including providing consumers a right to opt out of sales of their personal information. Additionally, the recently passed California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which will become operational in 2023, will significantly modify the CCPA, including expanding consumers’ rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information, and creating a new state agency that will be vested with authority to implement and enforce the CCPA and CPRA. The Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (“CDPA”) was signed into law on March 2, 2021 and will go into effect on January 1, 2023. The CDPA provides consumers with new rights to access, correct, delete and obtain a copy of the personal information a covered business holds about them, and to opt out of certain data processing activities. In addition, we may be subject to privacy and security laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate, obtain or store personally identifiable information. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business. For example, the processing of personal data in the EEA, is subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), which took effect in May 2018. The GDPR increases obligations with respect to clinical trials conducted in the EEA, such as in relation to the provision of fair processing notices, responding to data subjects who exercise their rights and reporting certain data breaches to regulators and affected individuals. The GDPR also requires us to enter certain contractual arrangements with third parties that process GDPR-covered personal data on our behalf. The GDPR also increases the scrutiny applied to transfers of personal data from the EEA (including from clinical trial sites in the EEA) to countries that are considered by the EC to lack an adequate level of data protection, such as the U.S. The July 2020 invalidation by the Court of Justice of the EU of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework, one of the mechanisms used to legitimize the transfer of personal data from the EEA to the U.S., has led to increased scrutiny on data transfers from the EEA to the U.S. generally and may increase our costs of compliance with data privacy legislation. If our or our partners’ or service providers’ privacy or data security measures fail to comply with the GDPR requirements, we may be subject to litigation, regulatory investigations, enforcement notices requiring us to change the way we use personal data and/or fines of up to EURO 20 million or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, as well as claims by affected individuals, negative publicity, reputational harm and a potential loss of business and goodwill. Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement We have an ongoing dialogue with payors globally with the goal of obtaining broad coverage for our products. To date, payors’ policies on coverage for our products have varied widely, including policies that allow broad coverage per the respective product’s prescribing information, policies that provide limited coverage and policies that have denied coverage. The majority of payors have policies that provide for case-by-case coverage or restricted coverage. Our revenue depends, in part, upon the extent to - 26 - which payors provide coverage for our products and the amount that payors, including government authorities or programs, private health insurers and other organizations, reimburse patients and healthcare providers for the cost of our products. Third Party Reimbursement and Pricing in the U.S. Commercial Insurance. Coverage and reimbursement of our products vary from commercial payor to commercial payor. Many commercial payors, such as managed care plans, manage access to FDA approved products, and may use drug formularies and medical policies (which may include specific coverage requirements such as prior authorization, re-authorization and achieving performance metrics under value-based contracts) to control utilization. Exclusion from or restriction in coverage can reduce product usage. Medicaid . Our products are eligible to be reimbursed by Medicaid. Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that is administered by the states for low income and disabled beneficiaries. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, participating manufacturers are required to pay a rebate for each unit of product reimbursed under the state Medicaid programs. The amount of the rebate for each product is set by law and depends in part on the prices at which our products are sold to certain other purchasers and may be subject to an additional discount if certain pricing increases more than inflation. State Medicaid programs and Medicaid managed care plans can seek additional “supplemental” rebates from manufacturers in connection with favorable positioning on formularies. Medicare . Medicare is a federal program that is administered by the federal government that covers individuals age 65 and over, disabled individuals and individuals with certain conditions. Our products are eligible for reimbursement under Medicare Part B. Medicare Part B generally covers drugs that are usually administered by physicians or other clinicians. Medicare Part B pays for such drugs under a payment methodology based on the average sales price (“ASP”) of the drugs. Reimbursement levels and reimbursement methodologies have come under scrutiny and may be subject to change. See “ Government Regulation – Healthcare and Other Reform. ” The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) are also increasingly bundling drug reimbursement into procedure costs, which can severely decrease the reimbursement rates for some manufacturers’ drugs. Federal Purchasers . Drug products are subject to discounted pricing when purchased by federal agencies via the Federal Supply Schedule (“FSS”). FSS participation is required for a drug product to be covered and reimbursed by certain federal agencies and for coverage under Medicaid, Medicare Part B and the Public Health Service (“PHS”) 340B drug pricing program. FSS pricing is negotiated periodically with the Department of Veterans Affairs. FSS pricing is intended not to exceed the price that a manufacturer charges its most-favored non-federal customer for its product. In addition, prices for drugs purchased by the Veterans Administration, Department of Defense (including drugs purchased by military personnel and dependents through the TRICARE retail pharmacy program), Coast Guard, and PHS are subject to a cap on pricing (known as the “federal ceiling price”) and may be subject to an additional discount if pricing increases more than the rate of inflation. PHS 340B Drug Pricing Program . To maintain coverage of drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and Medicare Part B, manufacturers are required to extend discounts to certain purchasers under the PHS 340B drug pricing program. Purchasers eligible for discounts include hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of financially needy patients, community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the PHS. Healthcare and Other Reform. In the U.S., federal and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reform delivery of, or payment for, health care, which include initiatives to reduce the cost of healthcare. For example, in March 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (the “Healthcare Reform Act”), which expanded health care coverage through Medicaid expansion, implemented the “individual mandate” for health insurance coverage (by imposing a tax penalty on individuals who did not obtain insurance) and changed the coverage and reimbursement of drug products under government healthcare programs. Under the Trump administration, there have been ongoing efforts to modify or repeal all or certain provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act. For example, tax reform legislation was enacted at the end of 2017 that eliminated the tax penalty established under the Healthcare Reform Act for individuals who do not maintain mandated health insurance coverage beginning in 2019. The Healthcare Reform Act has also been subject to judicial challenge. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the latest judicial challenge to the Healthcare Reform Act brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the Healthcare Reform Act. Beyond the Healthcare Reform Act, there have been ongoing healthcare reform efforts. Some recent healthcare reform efforts have sought to address certain issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including an expansion of telehealth coverage under Medicare and accelerated or advanced Medicare payments to healthcare providers. Other reform efforts affect pricing or payment for drug products. For example, the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program has been subject to statutory and regulatory changes and the discount that manufacturers of Medicare Part D brand name drugs must provide to Medicare Part D beneficiaries during the coverage gap increased from 50% to 70%. Additional reform efforts are likely. The Biden administration has focused on reforms that would address the high cost of drugs. In response to an Executive Order from President Biden, the Secretary of HHS issued a comprehensive plan for addressing high drug prices that describes a number of legislative approaches and identifies administrative tools to address the high - 27 - cost of drugs. Democrats also included drug pricing reform provisions reflecting elements of the plan in a broader proposed spending package in late 2021 - such as capping Medicare Part D patients out-of-pocket costs; establishing penalties for drug prices that increase faster than inflation in Medicare; and authorizing the federal government to negotiate prices on certain, select high cost drugs under Medicare Parts B and D. Healthcare reform efforts have been and may continue to be subject to scrutiny and legal challenge. For example, revisions to regulations under the federal anti-kickback statute would remove protection for traditional Medicare Part D discounts offered by pharmaceutical manufacturers to pharmacy benefit managers and health plans. Pursuant to court order, the removal was delayed and recent legislation imposed a moratorium on implementation of the rule until January 1, 2026. Adoption of new healthcare reform legislation at the federal or state level could affect demand for, or pricing of, our products or product candidates if approved for sale. We cannot predict, however, the ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or action, or its impact on us, and healthcare reform could increase compliance costs and may adversely affect our future business and financial results. There have also been efforts by government officials or legislators to implement measures to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products, including legislation on drug importation. Recently, there has been considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing and proposals to address the perceived high cost of pharmaceuticals. There have also been recent state legislative efforts to address drug costs, which generally have focused on increasing transparency around drug costs or limiting drug prices. Certain state legislation has been subject to legal challenges. Adoption of new legislation regulating drug pricing at the federal or state level could further affect demand for, or pricing of, our products. General legislative cost control measures may also affect reimbursement for our products. The Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended, resulted in the imposition of 2% reductions in Medicare (but not Medicaid) payments to providers in 2013 and remains in effect through 2030 (except May 1, 2020 to March 31, 2022) unless additional Congressional action is taken. Any significant spending reductions affecting Medicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented and/or any significant taxes or fees that may be imposed on us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Third Party Reimbursement and Pricing outside the U.S. We currently have no products approved for marketing outside the U.S., other than a marketing authorization for EXONDYS 51 in Israel. We may need to conduct long-term pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. In the EU and certain other territories, price controls and Health Technology Assessments for new, highly priced medicines are expected. Uncertainty exists about the pricing and reimbursement status of newly approved products in the EU. Criteria such as cost-effectiveness, cost per quality-adjusted life year, budget impact, or others, in addition to the clinical benefit, are often required to demonstrate added value or benefit of a drug and vary by country. Third party reimbursement limits may reduce the demand for our products. The pace of the application process in some countries could also delay commercial product launches. Gaining acceptance of our product pipeline and an economically viable reimbursement terms in the EU and other markets will require strong education and awareness efforts around Duchenne as well as strong data supporting its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. - 28 - Competition The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive, and any product candidate developed by us would likely compete with existing drugs and therapies. There are many pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, public and private universities, government agencies and research organizations that compete with us in developing various approaches to the treatment of rare, neuromuscular and other diseases. Many of these organizations have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing and marketing resources than we have. Several of them have developed or are developing therapies that could be used for treatment of the same diseases that we are targeting. In addition, some of these competitors have significantly greater commercial infrastructures than we have. Our ability to compete successfully will depend largely on: EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53 and AMONDYS 45 were the first three disease modifying therapeutics approved by FDA for the treatment of Duchenne for patients with a confirmed mutation that is amenable to exon 51 skipping, exon 53 skipping or exon 45 skipping, respectively. However, in the field of Duchenne alone, these products and those in our pipeline face a variety of competitors who either have FDA approval or are being clinically developed for the treatment of Duchenne. For example, Nippon Shinyaku Co. Ltd. (“Nippon”) announced on August 13, 2020 that the FDA approved VILTEPSO (viltolarsen) injection for patients with Duchenne who are amenable to exon 53 skipping therapy. On March 25, 2020, Nippon announced that the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare (“MHLW”) approved Viltepso Intravenous Infusion 250 mg (viltolarsen) for the treatment of patients with Duchenne who are amendable to exon 53 skipping therapy making it the first non-steroidal treatment for Duchenne approved in Japan. Nippon has announced plans to pursue global registration for viltolarsen. In addition, there are many companies who have announced plans to transition pre-clinical candidates to clinical development for the treatment of Duchenne, including the following: - 29 - There are several companies in addition to those mentioned above that are pursuing disease modifying programs for Duchenne that are at the pre-clinical stage or clinical stage. These companies are pursuing oligonucleotides, gene transfer therapy or gene editing. Other companies continue to pursue development and approval of products for the treatment of Duchenne and their products may or may not prove to be safer and/or more efficacious than the products and product candidates in our Duchenne pipeline. Regarding any of these competitors, it is unknown if clinical development of these or other compounds is planned or would be continued. Additionally, companies have product candidates with mechanisms of action distinct from ours in different stages of development or approval in Duchenne which we believe could be seen as complementary to exon skipping and not a direct replacement of our products or product candidates at this time. Several companies and institutions have also entered into collaborations or other agreements for the development of product candidates, including mRNA, gene (CRISPR, AAV, etc.) or small molecule therapies that are potential competitors to therapies being developed by us in the muscular dystrophy, neuromuscular, CNS and rare disease space. We also believe that other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies share a focus on RNA-targeted drug discovery and development. For additional information on the various risks posed by competition, refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Human Capital Resources Our urgent mission – to engineer precision genetic medicine for rare diseases that devastate lives and cut futures short – is dependent on our ability to attract, develop and retain the industry’s best and brightest talent across all dimensions of diversity. This understanding informs our approach to managing our human capital resources. General Information. As of December 31, 2021, we had 840 employees globally, 463 of whom hold advanced degrees. Of these employees, 503 are engaged directly in research and development activities and 337 are in selling and general and administration. None of our employees in the U.S. are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we consider relations with our employees to be good. Equity, diversity, and inclusion . We promote diversity, inclusion and equity across the organization. In the area of gender diversity, representation of women has increased over the past several years: in 2018 and 2019, women made up 51% and 54% of our workforce, respectively, and in 2020, this percentage increased to 55%. As of December 31, 2021, women made up 56% of our workforce. The number of women in leadership positions has also consistently increased. In 2017, women represented 35% of the leadership positions at the Director level and above. This percentage increased to 36% in 2018, 44% in 2019, 47% as of December 31, 2020 and 48% as of December 31, 2021. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, women held 28.6% of the seats of our Board of Directors, including the Chair of the Board. Racial and ethnic diversity has also increased in the past few years, from 23% of our workforce being racially/ethnically diverse in 2017 and 2018, to 26% in 2019. As of December 31, 2020, this number increased to 29%, and again to 30% as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, 50% of our Executive Committee , which represents the most senior leadership positions in the Company, is diverse based on gender and ethnicity. Compensation, Benefits and Ongoing Professional Development. We are committed to rewarding, supporting, and developing the employees who make it possible to deliver on our strategy. To that end, we offer a comprehensive total rewards package that includes market-competitive pay, broad-based equity grants and bonuses, healthcare benefits, retirement savings plans, paid time off and family leave, caregiving support, fitness subsidies, and an Employee Assistance Program. We also offer robust learning opportunities for employees at every stage in their career. For example, in 2020 we ran our leadership development program, ELEVATE, the participants of which reflect ethnic, racial and gender diversity. In 2021, we launched Pluma Coaching, which offers virtual, one on one professional development and executive coaching. We continue to adapt to the new challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, with solutions such as remote work, flexible schedules, childcare assistance, paid time off for COVID-19 related health and family care needs, and sessions focused on resilience and happiness in uncertain times. At the same time, we continue to protect our facility-dependent employees, including those needed - 30 - to maintain manufacturing and clinical research, by instituting strict protocols designed to ensure they remain healthy and feel supported and safe in our facilities. General Corporate Information We were originally incorporated in the State of Oregon on July 22, 1980, and on June 6, 2013, we reincorporated in the State of Delaware. Our principal executive offices are located at 215 First Street, Suite 415, Cambridge, MA 02142 and our telephone number is (617) 274-4000. Our common stock is quoted on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “SRPT”. While we achieve revenue from our products in the U.S. and through distribution of eteplirsen, golodirsen and casimersen through our EAP outside the U.S., we are likely to continue to incur operating losses in the near term associated with our ongoing operations, research and development activities and potential business development activities. For more information about our revenues and operating losses, see Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $2,125.8 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments, consisting of $2,115.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and $9.9 million of long-term restricted cash and investments. We believe that our balance of cash, cash equivalents and investments is sufficient to fund our current operational plan for at least the next twelve months. In addition to pursuing additional cash resources through public or private financings, we may also seek to enter into contracts, including collaborations or licensing agreements with respect to our technologies, with third parties, including government entities.

Set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC are descriptions of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report. Because of the following factors, as well as other variables affecting our operating results, past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also affect our results of operations and financial condition. Risks Related to Our Business We are highly dependent on the commercial success of our products in the U.S. and we may not be able to meet expectations with respect to sales of our products or attain profitability and positive cash-flow from operations. The FDA granted accelerated approval for EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53 and AMONDYS 45, as therapeutic treatments for Duchenne in patients who have a confirmed mutation in the dystrophin gene that is amenable to exon 51, exon 53 and exon 45 skipping, respectively. EXONDYS 51 is currently commercially available in the U.S. and Israel only, and VYONDYS 53 and AMONDYS 45 are currently commercially available in the U.S. only, although they are available in additional countries through our EAP. The commercial success of our products continues to depend on a number of factors attributable to one of our products or the products of our competitors, including, but not limited to: - 32 - In addition, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has presented challenges and risks. For example, the response to COVID-19 by healthcare providers has made it difficult for some patients to receive infusions or initiate treatment with our commercial products. The need to prioritize rated orders issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency pursuant to the U.S. Defense Production Act could also impact the manufacturing, supply chain and distribution of our products and product candidates. For this and other reasons, such as delays in processing reauthorizations and modifications to program benefits by insurers, we expect that COVID-19 will reduce our revenue from commercial product sales. We experience significant fluctuations in sales of our products from period to period and, ultimately, we may never generate sufficient revenues from our products to reach or maintain profitability or sustain our anticipated levels of operations. Even though EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53 and AMONDYS 45 have received accelerated approval by the FDA, they face future post-approval development and regulatory requirements, which will present additional challenges we will need to successfully navigate. The accelerated approvals for EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53 and AMONDYS 45 granted by the FDA were based on an increase in the surrogate biomarker of dystrophin in skeletal muscles observed in some patients treated with these products. These products will be subject to ongoing FDA requirements governing labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping, and we are required to submit additional safety, efficacy and other post-marketing information to the FDA. Under the accelerated approval pathway, continued approval may be contingent upon verification of a clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. These post-approval requirements and commitments may not be feasible and/or could impose significant burdens and costs on us; could negatively impact our development, manufacturing and supply of our products; and could negatively impact our financial results. Failure to meet post-approval commitments and requirements, including completion of enrollment and in particular, any failure to obtain positive safety and efficacy data from our ongoing and planned studies of our products, would lead to negative regulatory action from the FDA and/or withdrawal of regulatory approval of EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53 or AMONDYS 45. Manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP regulations. Drug product manufacturers are required to continuously monitor and report adverse events from clinical trials and commercial use of the product. If we or a regulatory agency discover previously unknown adverse events or events of unanticipated severity or frequency, a regulatory agency may require labeling changes, implementation of risk evaluation and mitigation strategy program, or additional post-marketing studies or clinical trials. If we or a regulatory agency discover previously unknown problems with a product, such as problems with a facility where the API or drug product is manufactured or tested, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product and/or the manufacturer, including removal of specific product lots from the market, withdrawal of the product from the market, suspension of manufacturing or suspension of clinical trials using the same manufacturing materials. Sponsors of drugs approved under FDA accelerated approval provisions also are required to submit to the FDA, at least 30 days before initial use, all promotional materials intended for use after the first 120 days following marketing approval. Failure by us or the manufacturing facilities for our products to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, may lead a regulatory agency to: - 33 - We are subject to uncertainty relating to reimbursement policies which, if not favorable, could hinder or prevent the commercial success of our products and/or product candidates. Our ability to successfully maintain and/or increase sales of our products in the U.S. depends in part on the coverage and reimbursement levels set by governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors. Third party payors are increasingly challenging the effectiveness of and prices charged for medical products and services. We may not be able to obtain or maintain adequate third-party coverage or reimbursement for our products, and/or we may be required to provide discounts or rebates on our products in order to obtain or maintain adequate coverage. We expect that private insurers will continue to consider the efficacy, effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and safety of our products, including any new data and analyses that we are able to collect and make available in a compliant manner, in determining whether to approve reimbursement for our products and at what levels. If there are considerable delays in the generation of new evidence or if any new data and information we collect is not favorable, third party insurers may make coverage decisions that negatively impact sales of our products. We continue to have discussions with payors, some of which may eventually deny coverage. We may not receive approval for reimbursement of our products from additional insurers on a satisfactory rate or basis, in which case our business would be materially adversely affected. In addition, obtaining these approvals can be a time consuming and expensive process. Our business would be materially adversely affected if we are not able to maintain favorable coverage decisions and/or fail to receive additional favorable coverage decisions from third party insurers, in particular during re-authorization processes for patients that have already initiated therapy. Our business could also be adversely affected if government health programs, private health insurers, including managed care organizations, or other reimbursement bodies or payors limit the indications for which our products will be reimbursed or fail to recognize accelerated approval and surrogate endpoints as clinically meaningful. In addition, the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in delays in processing reauthorizations and modifications to program benefits by insurers, making it difficult for patients to obtain or maintain favorable coverage decisions for our products. Furthermore, we cannot predict to what extent the COVID-19 pandemic, depending on its scale and duration, may disrupt global healthcare systems and access to our products or result in a widespread loss of individual health insurance coverage due to unemployment, a shift from commercial payor coverage to government payor coverage, or an increase in demand for patient assistance and/or free drug programs, any of which would adversely affect access to our products and our net sales. In some foreign countries, particularly Canada and the countries of Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to strict governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take 12 to 24 months or longer after the receipt of regulatory approval and product launch. In order to obtain favorable reimbursement for the indications sought or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to collect additional data, including conducting additional studies. Furthermore, several countries around the world have implemented government measures to either freeze or reduce pricing of pharmaceutical products. If reimbursement for our products is unavailable in any country in which reimbursement is sought, limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be materially harmed. In addition, many foreign countries are referencing to other countries’ official public list price, hence an unsatisfactory price level in one country could consequently impinge negatively upon overall revenue. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of our current and future products due to a number of factors, including current and future healthcare reforms and initiatives by government health programs and private insurers (including managed care plans) to reduce healthcare costs, the scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing, the ongoing debates on reducing government spending and additional legislative proposals. These healthcare reform efforts or any future legislation or regulatory actions aimed at controlling and reducing healthcare costs, including through measures designed to limit reimbursement, restrict access or impose - 34 - unfavorable pricing modifications on pharmaceutical products, could impact our and our partners’ ability to obtain or maintain reimbursement for our products at satisfactory levels, or at all, which could materially harm our business and financial results. Additionally, our gene therapy product candidates represent novel approaches to treatment that will call for new levels of innovation in both pricing, reimbursement, payment and drug access strategies. Current reimbursement models may not accommodate the unique factors of our gene therapy product candidates, including high up-front costs, lack of long-term efficacy and safety data and fees associated with complex administration, dosing and patient monitoring requirements. Hence, it may be necessary to restructure approaches to payment, pricing strategies and traditional payment models to support these therapies. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. If we are unable to obtain adequate levels of reimbursement, our ability to successfully market and sell our products and product candidates will be harmed. The manner and level at which reimbursement is provided for services related to our products and product candidates (e.g., for administration of our products to patients) is also important. Inadequate reimbursement for such services may lead to physician resistance and limit our ability to market or sell our products. Healthcare policy reform and other governmental and private payor initiatives may have an adverse effect upon, and could prevent commercial success of our products and product candidates. The U.S. government and individual states continue to aggressively pursue healthcare reform, as evidenced by efforts in recent years to modify or repeal the Affordable Care Act and ongoing attempts to control and/or lower the cost of prescription drugs and biologics. The Affordable Care Act substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and contains a number of provisions that affect coverage and reimbursement of drug products and/or that could potentially reduce the demand for pharmaceutical products such as increasing drug rebates under state Medicaid programs for brand name prescription drugs and extending those rebates to Medicaid managed care and assessing a fee on manufacturers and importers of brand name prescription drugs reimbursed under certain government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Other aspects of healthcare reform, such as expanded government enforcement authority and heightened standards that could increase compliance-related costs, could also affect our business. The Affordable Care Act has been subject to modification and additional modifications may occur. There are, and may continue to be, judicial challenges to those efforts. Legislative, Administrative, and private payor efforts to control drug costs span a range of proposals, including drug price negotiation, Medicare Part D redesign, drug price inflation rebates, international mechanisms, generic drug promotion and anticompetitive behavior, manufacturer reporting, and reforms that could impact therapies utilizing the accelerated approval pathway. We cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any changes to the Affordable Care Act or other federal and state healthcare policy reform efforts including those aimed at drug pricing. There is no assurance that federal or state health care reform will not adversely affect our future business and financial results, and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative, judicial or administrative changes relating to healthcare policy will affect our business. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, waiver from Medicaid drug rebate law requirements, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs and the introduction of international reference pricing in the U.S. We anticipate that the U.S. Congress, state legislatures and the private sector will continue to consider and may adopt healthcare policies intended to curb rising healthcare costs. These cost containment measures may include implementation or modification of: We are unable to predict what additional legislation, regulations or policies, if any, relating to the healthcare industry or third party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future or what effect such legislation, regulations or policies would have on - 35 - our business. Any cost containment measures, including those listed above, or other healthcare system reforms that are adopted, could significantly decrease the available coverage and the price we might establish for our products and product candidates, which would have an adverse effect on our net revenues and operating results. Our products may not be widely adopted by patients, payors or healthcare providers, which would adversely impact our potential profitability and future business prospects. The commercial success of our products, particularly in the U.S., depends upon the level of market adoption by patients, payors and healthcare providers. If our products do not achieve an adequate level of market adoption for any reason, or if market adoption does not persist, our potential profitability and our future business prospects will be severely adversely impacted. The degree of market acceptance of our products depends on a number of factors, including: We may not be able to expand the global footprint of our products outside of the U.S. Even though EXONDYS 51 was approved for marketing in the U.S. and in Israel, and VYONDYS 53 and AMONDYS 45 were approved for marketing in the U.S., we may not receive approval to commercialize these products in additional countries. In November 2016, we submitted a MAA for eteplirsen to the EMA and the application was validated in December 2016. As we announced on June 1, 2018, the CHMP of the EMA adopted a negative opinion for eteplirsen. In September 2018, the CHMP of the EMA confirmed its negative opinion for eteplirsen, and the EC adopted the CHMP opinion in December 2018. In order to market any product in a country outside of the U.S., we must comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements for approval in those countries regarding demonstration of evidence of the product’s safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, labeling, distribution, advertising, and promotion, as well as pricing and reimbursement of the product. Obtaining marketing approval in a country outside of the U.S. is an extensive, lengthy, expensive and uncertain process, and the regulatory authority may reject an application or delay, limit or deny approval of any of our products for many reasons, including: - 36 - Approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ significantly from that required to obtain approval in the U.S. In particular, in many foreign countries, it is required that a product receives pricing and reimbursement approval before the product can be distributed commercially. Many foreign countries undertake cost-containment measures that could affect pricing or reimbursement of our products. This can result in substantial delays, and the price that is ultimately approved in some countries may be lower than the price for which we expect to offer our products. Marketing approval in one country does not ensure marketing approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining marketing approval in one country may have a negative effect on the approval process in others. Failure to obtain marketing approval in other countries or any delay or setback in obtaining such approval would impair our ability to develop foreign markets for our products and could adversely affect our business and financial condition. In addition, failure to obtain approval in one country or area may affect sales under the EAP in other countries or areas. Even if we are successful in obtaining regulatory approval of our products in additional countries, our revenue earning capacity will depend on commercial and medical infrastructure, pricing and reimbursement negotiations and decisions with third party payors, including government payors. In addition, we have granted Roche an exclusive option to obtain an exclusive license to commercialize certain products, including eteplirsen, golodirsen and casimersen, outside of the U.S. If this option is exercised, Roche will have sole control over and decision-making authority with respect to the commercialization of such products outside the U.S. We cannot predict whether historical revenues from eteplirsen, golodirsen and casimersen through our EAP outside the U.S. will continue or whether we will be able to continue to distribute eteplirsen, golodirsen and casimersen through our EAP. We established a global EAP for eteplirsen, golodirsen and casimersen in some countries where these products currently have not been approved. While we generate revenue from the distribution of these products through our EAP, we cannot predict whether historical revenues from this program will continue, whether we will be able to continue to distribute our products through our EAP, or whether revenues will exceed revenues historically generated from sales through our EAP. Reimbursement through national EAPs may cease to be available if authorization for an EAP expires or is terminated. For example, healthcare providers in EAP jurisdictions may not be convinced that their patients benefit sufficiently from our products or alternatively, may prefer to wait until such time as our products are approved by a regulatory authority in their country before prescribing any of our products. Even if a healthcare provider is interested in obtaining access to our products for its patient through the EAP, the patient will not be able to obtain access to our products if funding for the drug is not secured. Any failure to maintain revenues from sales of eteplirsen, golodirsen or casimersen through our EAP and/or to generate revenues from commercial sales of these products exceeding historical sales through our EAP could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. - 37 - Failure to obtain or maintain regulatory exclusivity for our products could result in our inability to protect our products from competition and our business may be adversely impacted. If a competitor obtains an authorization to market the same or substantially same product before a product of ours is authorized in a given country and is granted regulatory exclusivity, then our product may not be authorized for sale as a result of the competitor’s regulatory exclusivity and as a result, our investment in the development of that product may not be returned. In addition to any patent protection, we rely on various forms of regulatory exclusivity to protect our products. During the development of our products, we anticipate any one form of regulatory exclusivities becoming available upon approval of our products. Implementation and enforcement of regulatory exclusivity, which may consist of regulatory data protection and market protection, varies widely from country to country. Failure to qualify for regulatory exclusivity, or failure to obtain or maintain the extent or duration of such protections that we expect in each of the markets for our products due to challenges, changes or interpretations in the law or otherwise, could affect our revenues for our products or our decision on whether to market our products in a particular country or countries or could otherwise have an adverse impact on our results of operations. We are not guaranteed to receive or maintain regulatory exclusivity for our current or future products, and if our products that are granted orphan status were to lose their status as orphan drugs or the data or marketing exclusivity provided for orphan drugs, our business and operations could be adversely affected. Due to the nature of our products and product candidate pipeline, in addition to new chemical entity exclusivity and new biologic exclusivity, orphan drug exclusivity is especially important for our products that are eligible for orphan drug designation. For eligible products, we plan to rely on orphan drug exclusivity to maintain a competitive position. If we do not have adequate patent protection for our products, then the relative importance of obtaining regulatory exclusivity is even greater. While orphan status for any of our products, if granted or maintained, would provide market exclusivity for the time periods specified above upon approval, we would not be able to exclude other companies from obtaining regulatory approval of products using the same or similar active ingredient for the same indication during or beyond the exclusivity period applicable to our product on the basis of orphan drug status (e.g., seven years in the U.S.). For example, the exclusivity period for EXONDYS 51 will end in September 2023. Orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug, nor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process. In addition, we may face risks with maintaining regulatory exclusivities for our products, and our protection may be circumvented, even if maintained. For instance, orphan drug exclusivity in the U.S. may be rescinded if (i) an alternative, competing product demonstrates clinical superiority to our product with orphan exclusivity; or (ii) we are unable to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of our orphan products to meet the needs of patients. Moreover, competitors may receive approval of different drugs or biologics for indications for which our prior approved orphan products have exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity in Europe may be modified for several reasons, including a significant change to the orphan medicinal product designations or status criteria after-market authorization of the orphan product ( e.g. , product profitability exceeds the criteria for orphan drug designation), problems with the production or supply of the orphan drug, or a competitor drug, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior than the initial orphan drug. Thus, other companies may have received, or could receive, approval to market a product candidate that is granted orphan drug exclusivity for the same drug or similar drug and same orphan indication as any of our product candidates for which we plan to file an NDA, BLA or MAA. If that were to happen, our prior approved orphan products may face competition and any pending NDA, BLA or MAA for our product candidate for that indication may not be approved until the competing company’s period of exclusivity has expired in the U.S. or the EU, as applicable. For example, in September 2021, the FDA issued guidance concerning its position on interpreting when gene therapy products would be considered the “same” or “different” for purposes of orphan drug exclusivity. The guidance states that if two gene therapy products have or use different vectors, the FDA generally intends to consider them to be “different” drugs. Further, according to the guidance, the FDA generally intends to consider vectors from the same viral group (e.g., adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2) vs. adeno-associated virus 5 (AAV5)) to be different, when the differences between the vectors impact factors such as tropism, immune response avoidance, or potential insertional mutagenesis. However, there is considerable uncertainty as to the interpretation of these guidelines. As illustrated by this guidance, orphan drug exclusivity as applied to gene therapy products is an evolving area subject to change and interpretation by the FDA and therefore, we cannot be certain as to how the FDA will apply those rules to our products. If we are unable to successfully maintain and further develop internal commercialization capabilities, sales of our products may be negatively impacted. We have hired and trained a commercial team and put in the organizational infrastructure we believe we need to support the commercial success of our products in the U.S. Factors that may inhibit our efforts to maintain and further develop commercial capabilities include: - 38 - If we are not successful in maintaining an effective commercial, sales and marketing infrastructure, we will encounter difficulty in achieving, maintaining or increasing projected sales of our products in the U.S., which would adversely affect our business and financial condition. The patient population suffering from Duchenne, LGMDs, and CMT 1A is small and has not been established with precision. If the actual number of patients is smaller than we estimate, our revenue and ability to achieve profitability may be adversely affected. Duchenne, LGMD, and CMT 1A are rare, fatal genetic disorders. Duchenne affects an estimated one in approximately every 3,500 to 5,000 males born worldwide, of which up to 13% are estimated to be amenable to exon 51 skipping, up to 8% are estimated to be amenable to exon 53 skipping and up to 8% are estimated to be amenable to exon 45 skipping. LGMDs as a class affect an estimated range of approximately one in every 14,500 to one in every 123,000 individuals. CMT is a group of peripheral nerve disorders affecting approximately one in every 2,500 individuals. CMT type 1A affects approximately 50,000 patients in the U.S. Our estimates of the size of these patient populations are based on limited number of published studies as well as internal analyses. Various factors may decrease the market size of our products and product candidates, including the severity of the disease, patient demographics and the response of patients’ immune systems to our products and product candidates. If the results of these studies or our analysis of them do not accurately reflect the relevant patient population, our assessment of the market may be inaccurate, making it difficult or impossible for us to meet our revenue goals, or to obtain and maintain profitability. We face intense competition and rapid technological change, which may result in other companies discovering, developing or commercializing competitive products. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and subject to significant and rapid technological change. We are aware of many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are actively engaged in research and development in areas in which our products and product candidates are aimed. Some of these competitors are developing or testing product candidates that now, or may in the future, compete directly with our products or product candidates. For example, we face competition in the field of Duchenne by third parties who are developing or who had once developed: (i) exon skipping product candidates, such as Wave Life Sciences (notably for exons 51 and 53), Nippon Shinyaku (notably for exon 44 and exon 53, for which it has received FDA approval for its product Viltepso (viltolarsen)), Daiichi Sankyo (notably for exon 45), Dyne Therapeutics pursuing antibody-oligonucleotide conjugates for exons 44, 45, 51, and 53, Avidity Biosciences pursuing antibody-oligonucleotide conjugates for exons 44, 45 and 51), Entrada Therapeutics (notably for exon 44), Audentes Therapeutics, Inc. (acquired by Astellas Pharma) pursuing AAV vector delivery of oligonucleotides (for exons 2, 51 and 53), PepGen (notably for exon 51) and BioMarin (BMN-351 for exon 51); (ii) gene therapies that express micro-dystrophin or mini-dystrophin, such as Pfizer, Solid Biosciences (in partnership with Ultragenyx), Regenxbio and Bristol-Myers Squibb; (iii) gene editing, including CRISPR/Cas 9 approaches, such as Vertex Pharmaceuticals, CRISPR Therapeutics, Editas Medicine and Precision Biosciences (in partnership with Eli Lilly); (iv) other disease modifying approaches, such as PTC Therapeutics, which has a small molecule candidate, ataluren, that targets nonsense mutations; and (v) other approaches that may be palliative in nature or potentially complementary with our products and product candidates and that are or were once being developed by Santhera, Catabasis, Fibrogen, ReveraGen, Capricor Therapeutics, BioPhytis, Mallinckrodt, Antisense Therapeutics and Edgewise Therapeutics. Although BioMarin announced on May 31, 2016 its intent to discontinue clinical and regulatory development of drisapersen as well as its other clinical stage candidates, BMN 044, BMN 045 and BMN 053, then-currently in Phase 2 studies for distinct forms of Duchenne, it further announced in 2021 its plans to submit an IND for BMN-351, an oligonucleotide therapy. In addition, while Wave announced its intention to discontinue development of suvodirsen and suspend development of WVE-N531, it has announced that it commenced clinical development for its exon 53 oligonucleotide, WVE-N531. In addition, we are aware of many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are actively engaged in research and development using platform technologies that may be viewed as competing with ours including those companies mentioned immediately above, as well as other companies including, but not limited to Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corp., Deciphera Pharmaceuticals, Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Roche Innovation Center Copenhagen (formerly Santaris Pharma A/S), Takeda, Biogen, Moderna Therapeutics, Stoke Therapeutics, Fulcrum Therapeutics, Synthena AG, DTx Pharma, PYC Therapeutics, and Sanofi. Additionally, several companies and institutions have entered into collaborations or other agreements for the development of product candidates, including mRNA, gene therapy and gene editing (CRIPSR and AAV, among others) and small molecule therapies that are potential competitors for therapies being developed in the muscular dystrophy, neuromuscular and rare - 39 - disease space, including, but not limited to, Astellas Pharma, Biogen Inc., Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Ionis, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Sanofi, Takeda, Eli Lilly, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Moderna Therapeutics, Inc., Akashi, Catabasis, Capricor Therapeutics, Oxford University, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, and Editas Medicine. If any of our competitors are successful in obtaining regulatory approval for any of their product candidates, it may limit our ability to enter into the market, gain market share or maintain market share in the Duchenne space or other diseases targeted by our platform technologies, products and product candidate pipeline. It is possible that our competitors will succeed in developing technologies that, in addition to limiting the market size for our products or product candidates, impact the regulatory approval and post-marketing process for our products and product candidates, are more effective than our products or product candidates or would render our technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. Our competitors may, among other things, relative to our products or product candidates: Our revenue could face competitive pressures for any of the above reasons. Moreover, if competing products are marketed in a territory in which we also have the authority to market our products, our sales may diminish, or our business could be otherwise materially adversely affected. We have entered into multiple collaborations and strategic transactions, including our collaboration with Roche, and may seek or engage in future strategic collaborations, alliances, acquisitions, licensing agreements or other relationships that complement or expand our business. We may not be able to complete such transactions, and such transactions, if executed, may increase our capital requirements, dilute our stockholders, cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities and subject us to other risks. In order to achieve our long-term business objectives, we actively evaluate strategic opportunities on an ongoing basis, including licensing or acquiring products, technologies or businesses. We may face competition from other companies in pursuing such opportunities. This competition is most intense for approved drugs and late-stage drug candidates, which have the lowest risk in terms of probability of success but would have a higher risk and more immediate effect on our financial performance. Our ability to complete transactions may also be limited by applicable antitrust and trade regulation laws and regulations in the relevant U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. We have entered into multiple collaborations, including with Roche, Nationwide, Duke University, Genethon, StrideBio, University of Florida, Genevant Sciences, Dyno Therapeutics, Selecta Biosciences, GenEdit and Hansa Biopharma. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of such collaborations, and the anticipated benefits of any future collaborations or strategic relationships, each of which involves numerous risks, including: - 40 - For example, we will have limited influence and control over the development and commercialization activities of Roche in the territories in which it leads development and commercialization of SRP-9001, and if the exclusive option is exercised, in the territories in which it leads commercialization of certain other products or product candidates. Roche’s development and commercialization activities in the territories where it is the lead party may adversely impact our own efforts in the U.S. Failure by Roche to meet its obligations under the collaboration agreement, to apply sufficient efforts at developing and commercializing collaboration products, or to comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements, may materially adversely affect our business and our results of operations. In addition, to the extent we rely on Roche to commercialize any products upon obtaining regulatory approval, we may receive less revenues than if we commercialized these products ourselves, which could materially harm our prospects. - 41 - Even if we achieve the long-term benefits associated with strategic transactions, our expenses and short-term costs may increase materially and adversely affect our liquidity and short-term net income (loss). Future strategic transactions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, the creation of contingent liabilities, impairment or expenses related to goodwill, and impairment or amortization expenses related to other intangible assets, which could harm our financial condition. Risks Related to the Development of our Product Candidates We may find it difficult to enroll patients in our clinical trials, which could delay or prevent clinical trials of our product candidates. Identifying and qualifying patients to participate in clinical trials of our product candidates is critical to our success. The timing of our clinical trials depends on the speed at which we can recruit eligible patients to participate in testing our product candidates. We have experienced delays in some of our clinical trials, and we may experience similar delays in the future. These delays could result in increased costs, delays in advancing our product development, delays in testing the effectiveness of our technology or termination of the clinical trials altogether. We may not be able to identify, recruit and enroll a sufficient number of patients, or those with required or desired characteristics to achieve diversity in a study, to complete our clinical trials within the expected timeframe. Patient enrollment can be impacted by factors including, but not limited to: In particular, each of the conditions for which we plan to evaluate our product candidates are rare genetic diseases with limited patient pools from which to draw for clinical trials. Further, because newborn screening for these diseases is not widely adopted, and it can be difficult to diagnose these diseases in the absence of a genetic screen, we may have difficulty finding patients who are eligible to participate in our studies. The eligibility criteria of our clinical trials will further limit the pool of available study participants. Additionally, the process of finding and diagnosing patients may prove costly. The treating physicians in our clinical trials may also use their medical discretion in advising patients enrolled in our clinical trials to withdraw from our studies to try alternative therapies. In addition, our ability to recruit and enroll patients in our clinical trials may be negatively impacted by the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, including patients’ ability and willingness to travel to clinical trial sites as a result of quarantines and other restrictions. We may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials if we cannot enroll the required eligible patients per protocol to participate in the clinical trials required by the FDA or the EMA or other regulatory agencies. Our ability to successfully initiate, - 42 - enroll and complete a clinical trial in any foreign country is subject to numerous risks unique to conducting business in foreign countries, including: If we have difficulty enrolling a sufficient number of patients to conduct our clinical trials as planned, we may need to delay, limit or terminate ongoing or planned clinical trials, any of which would have an adverse effect on our business. Failures or delays in the commencement or completion of ongoing and planned clinical trials of our product candidates could negatively impact commercialization efforts; result in increased costs; and delay, prevent or limit our ability to gain regulatory approval of product candidates and to generate revenues and continue our business. Successful completion of clinical trials at each applicable stage of development is a prerequisite to submitting a marketing application to the regulatory agencies and, consequently, the ultimate approval and commercial marketing of any of our product candidates for the indications in which we develop them. We do not know whether any of our clinical trials will begin or be completed, and results announced, as planned or expected, if at all, as the commencement and completion of clinical trials and announcement of results is often delayed or prevented for a number of reasons, including, among others: - 43 - Any inability to complete successfully pre-clinical and clinical development could result in additional costs to us or impair our ability to generate revenues from product sales, regulatory and commercialization milestones and royalties. In addition, manufacturing or formulation changes to our product candidates often require additional studies to demonstrate comparability of the modified product candidates to earlier versions. Clinical study delays also shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, which impairs our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and harms our business and results of operations. Clinical development is lengthy and uncertain. Clinical trials of our novel gene therapy candidates may be delayed, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and certain programs may never advance in the clinic or may be more costly to conduct than we anticipate, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business. Clinical testing is expensive and complex and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. We may not be able to initiate, may experience delays in, or may have to discontinue clinical trials for our product candidates as a result of numerous unforeseen events, including: In addition, the impact of COVID-19 has caused disruptions and may cause delays in some of our clinical trials. The recent responses to COVID-19 by healthcare providers and regulatory agencies could delay the commencement of clinical trials, site - 44 - initiation, protocol compliance, the completion of clinical trials, including the completion of post-marketing requirements and commitments, slow down enrollment, and make the ongoing collection of data for patients enrolled in studies more difficult or intermittent. Results from pre-clinical and early‑stage clinical trials may not be indicative of safety or efficacy in late‑stage clinical trials, and pre-clinical and clinical trials may fail to demonstrate acceptable levels of safety, efficacy, and quality of our product candidates, which could prevent or significantly delay their regulatory approval. To obtain the requisite regulatory approvals to market and sell any of our product candidates, we must demonstrate, through extensive pre-clinical and clinical trials, that the product candidate is safe and effective in humans. Ongoing and future pre-clinical and clinical trials of our product candidates may not show sufficient safety, efficacy or adequate quality to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals. For example, although we believe the data for SRP-9001, SRP-9003 and SRP-5051 collected to date are positive, the additional data we collect may not be consistent with the pre-clinical and/or early clinical data or show a safe benefit that warrants further development or pursuit of a regulatory approval for these product candidates. Furthermore, success in pre-clinical and early clinical trials does not ensure that the subsequent trials will be successful, nor does it predict final results of a confirmatory trial. Some of our clinical trials were conducted with small patient populations and were not blinded or placebo-controlled, making it difficult to predict whether the favorable results that we observed in such trials will be repeated in larger and more advanced clinical trials. For example, our most recent announcements for SRP-9001, SRP-9003 and SRP-5051 include: in January 2022, we announced topline results for Part 2 of Study 102 for SRP-9001; in May 2021, we announced results from the 30 mg/kg cohort of Part A of Study 5051-201 for SRP-5051; and in May 2021, we announced twelve-month functional data from three clinical trial participants in the high-dose cohort, and 24-month functional data from three clinical trial participants in the low-dose cohort for SRP-9003. These data are based on small patient samples, and, given the heterogeneity of Duchenne and LGMD patients and potential lot-to-lot variability, the data may not be predictive of future results. In addition, we cannot assure that the results of additional data or data from any future trial will yield results that are consistent with the data presented, that we will be able to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of these product candidates, that later trial results will support further development, or even if such later results are favorable, that we will be able to successfully complete the development of, obtain accelerated, conditional or standard regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize any of such product candidates. Similarly, we cannot provide assurances that data from our ongoing and planned studies with respect to our commercially approved products and product candidates will be positive and consistent or that the interpretation by regulators, such as the FDA or EMA, of the data we collect for our products or product candidates will be consistent with our interpretations. Our product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of product candidates, limit the commercial potential or result in significant negative consequences following any potential marketing approval. Our product candidates may cause undesirable side effects. In addition to side effects caused by our product candidates, the administration process or related procedures also can cause adverse side effects. If any such adverse events occur in our trials, we may decide, or the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authorities could order us, to halt, delay or amend pre-clinical development or clinical development of our product candidates or we may be unable to receive regulatory approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. Even if we are able to demonstrate that all future serious adverse events are not product-related, such occurrences could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial. Moreover, if we elect, or are required, to delay, suspend or terminate any clinical trial of any of our product candidates, the commercial prospects of such product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate product revenues from any of these product candidates may be delayed or eliminated. Any of these occurrences may harm our ability to develop other product candidates and may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly. Our gene therapy product candidates may be perceived as unsafe or may result in unforeseen adverse events. Failure of other gene therapy programs, negative public opinion and increased regulatory scrutiny of gene therapy may damage public perception of the safety of our gene therapy product candidates and harm our ability to conduct our business or obtain regulatory approvals for our gene therapy product candidates. Gene therapy remains a newly applied technology, with only a few gene therapy products approved to date in the U.S., the EU or elsewhere. Public perception may be influenced by claims that gene therapy is unsafe, and gene therapy may not gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community. In particular, our success will depend upon physicians who specialize in the treatment of genetic diseases targeted by our product candidates, prescribing treatments that involve the use of our product candidates in lieu of, or in addition to, existing treatments with which they are familiar and for which greater clinical data may be available. In addition, ethical, social and legal concerns about gene therapy, genetic testing and genetic research could result in additional regulations or prohibiting the processes we may use. Federal and state agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments have expressed their intentions to further regulate biotechnology. More restrictive regulations or claims that our product - 45 - candidates are unsafe or pose a hazard could prevent us from commercializing any products. New government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, regulations, policies or guidance changed, or interpretations by agencies or courts changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. More restrictive government regulations or negative public opinion would harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and may delay or impair the development and commercialization of our gene therapy product candidates or demand for any products we may develop. For example, earlier gene therapy trials led to several well-publicized adverse events, including death. Lack of efficacy and/or serious adverse events related to clinical trials we, our strategic partners or other companies conduct, even if such adverse events are not ultimately attributable to the relevant product candidates or products, and/or failed commercialization of gene therapy products may result in increased government regulation, unfavorable public perception, potential regulatory delays in the testing or approval of our product candidates, stricter labeling requirements for those product candidates that are approved and a decrease in demand for any such product candidates. If there are significant delays in obtaining or we are unable to obtain or maintain required regulatory approvals, we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates in a timely manner or at all, which could impair our ability to generate sufficient revenue and have a successful business. The research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, commercialization, marketing, selling and distribution of drug products are subject to extensive regulation by applicable local, regional and national regulatory authorities and regulations may differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In the U.S., approvals and oversight from federal (e.g., FDA), state and other regulatory authorities are required for these activities. Sale and marketing of our product candidates in the U.S. or other countries is not permitted until we obtain the required approvals from the applicable regulatory authorities. Of the large number of drugs in development in the biopharmaceutical industry, only a small percentage result in the submission of a marketing application to the FDA or an MAA to the EMA and even fewer are approved for commercialization. Our ability to obtain the government or regulatory approvals required to commercialize any of our product candidates in any jurisdiction, including in the U.S. or the EU, cannot be assured, may be significantly delayed or may never be achieved for various reasons including the following: - 46 - Any failure on our part to respond to these requirements in a timely and satisfactory manner could significantly delay or negatively impact confirmatory study timelines and/or the development plans we have for PMO, PPMO, gene therapy-based product candidates or other product candidates. Responding to requests from regulators and meeting requirements for clinical trials, submissions and approvals may require substantial personnel, financial or other resources, which, as a small biopharmaceutical company, we may not be able to obtain in a timely manner or at all. In addition, our ability to respond to requests from regulatory authorities that involve our agents, third party vendors and associates may be complicated by our own limitations and those of the parties we work with. It may be difficult or impossible for us to conform to regulatory guidance or successfully execute our product development plans in response to regulatory guidance, including guidance related to clinical trial design with respect to any NDA, BLA or MAA submissions. Even if our product candidates demonstrate safety and efficacy in clinical studies, the regulatory agencies may not complete their review processes in a timely manner, or we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval. Additional delays may result if an FDA Advisory Committee or other regulatory advisory group or authority recommends non-approval or restrictions on approval. In addition, we may experience delays or rejections based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action, or changes in regulatory agency policy during the period of product development, clinical studies and the review process. Regulatory agencies also may approve a treatment candidate for fewer or more limited indications than requested or may grant approval subject to the performance of post-marketing studies. Furthermore, regulatory agencies may not approve the labeling claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our treatment candidates. Finally, some of our product candidates may require diagnostic tests to ensure we appropriately select patients suitable for treatment. If we are unable to successfully develop diagnostic tests for these product candidates, experience significant delays in doing so, or are unable to obtain required regulatory clearances or approvals for any diagnostic tests, the commercialization of our product candidates may be delayed or prevented. Even if we receive the required regulatory clearance or approvals for certain diagnostic tests, the commercial success of any of our product candidates that require such tests will be dependent upon the continued availability of such tests. Even after approval and commercialization of a product candidate, we remain subject to ongoing regulatory compliance and oversight to maintain our approval. Conducting our post marketing commitments for our three commercialized products studies could take years to complete, could yield negative or uninterpretable results or could result in an FDA determination that the studies do not provide the safety and efficacy requirements to maintain regulatory approval. If we or any of our strategic partners are unable to develop, or obtain regulatory approval for, or, if approved, maintain regulatory compliance and successfully commercialize, our product candidates, our business will be materially harmed. We are investing significant resources in the development of novel gene therapy product candidates. Only a few gene therapy products have been approved in the U.S. and EU. If we are unable to show the safety and efficacy of these product candidates, experience delays in doing so or are unable to successfully commercialize at least one of these drugs, our business would be materially harmed. We are investing significant resources in the development of our gene therapy product candidates. We believe that a significant portion of the long-term value attributed to our company by investors is based on the commercial potential of these product candidates. There can be no assurance that any development problems we experience in the future related to our gene therapy programs will not cause significant delays or unanticipated costs, or that such development problems can be solved. Development problems and delays in one program may delay the development of other programs. Early results from ongoing clinical trials may differ materially from final results from such clinical trials. The results from pre-clinical and early clinical studies do not always accurately predict results in later, large-scale clinical trials. We may also experience delays in developing a sustainable, reproducible and commercial-scale manufacturing process or transferring that process to commercial partners, which may prevent us from completing our clinical trials or commercializing our products on a timely or profitable basis, if at all. In addition, the clinical trial requirements of the FDA, the EMA, and other regulatory agencies and the criteria these regulators use to determine the safety and efficacy of a product candidate vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use and market of the potential products. The regulatory approval process for novel product candidates such as ours can be more expensive and take longer than for other, better known or more extensively studied pharmaceutical or other product candidates. Currently, only a few gene therapy products have been approved in the Western world. Given the few precedents of approved gene therapy products, it is difficult to determine how long it will take or how much it will cost to obtain regulatory approvals for our gene therapy product candidates in the U.S., the EU or other jurisdictions. Approvals by the EMA and the EC may not be indicative of what the FDA may require for approval. Regulatory requirements governing gene therapy products have evolved and may continue to change in the future. Within the FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (“CBER”) regulates gene therapy products. Within the CBER, the review of gene therapy and related products is consolidated in the Office of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies, and the FDA has established the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER on its reviews. The CBER works closely with the - 47 - National Institutes of Health (the “NIH”). The FDA and the NIH have published guidance documents with respect to the development and submission of gene therapy protocols. For example, on January 28, 2020, the FDA issued final guidance documents that updated draft guidance documents that were originally released in July 2018 to reflect recent advances in the field, and to set forth the framework for the development, review and approval of gene therapies. These final guidance documents pertain to the development of gene therapies for the treatment of specific disease categories, including rare diseases, and to manufacturing and long-term follow up issues relevant to gene therapy, among other topics. The FDA also issued a new guidance document in September 2021 describing the FDA’s approach for determining whether two gene therapy products were the same or different for the purpose of assessing orphan drug exclusivity. In addition, the FDA can put an IND on hold if the information in an IND is not sufficient to assess the risks in pediatric patients. These regulatory review agencies, committees and advisory groups and the new requirements and guidelines they promulgate may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to perform additional or larger studies, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of these treatment candidates or lead to significant post-approval studies, limitations or restrictions. As we advance our product candidates, we will be required to consult with these regulatory and advisory groups and comply with applicable requirements and guidelines, failure of which may lead to delayed or discontinued development of our product candidates. If the anticipated or actual timing of marketing approvals for our gene therapy product candidates, or the market acceptance of these product candidates, if approved, including treatment reimbursement levels agreed to by third-party payors, do not meet the expectations of investors or public market analysts, the market price of our common stock would likely decline. Because we are developing product candidates for the treatment of certain diseases in which there is little clinical experience and we are using new endpoints or methodologies, there is increased risk that the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authorities may not consider the endpoints of our clinical trials to provide clinically meaningful results and that these results may be difficult to analyze. During the FDA review process, we will need to identify success criteria and endpoints such that the FDA will be able to determine the clinical efficacy and safety profile of our product candidates. As we are developing novel treatments for diseases in which there is little clinical experience with new endpoints and methodologies, such as gene therapy, there is heightened risk that the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory bodies may not consider the clinical trial endpoints to provide clinically meaningful results (reflecting a tangible benefit to patients). In addition, the resulting clinical data and results may be difficult to analyze. Even if the FDA does find our success criteria to be sufficiently validated and clinically meaningful, we may not achieve the pre-specified endpoints to a degree of statistical significance. Achieving appropriate statistical power may be challenging for some of the ultra-rare genetically defined diseases we are targeting in our programs, especially if the acceptance of descriptive data is not yet established. In addition, different methodologies, assumptions and applications we utilize to assess particular safety or efficacy parameters may yield different statistical results. Even if we believe the data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates are promising, these data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities. Pre-clinical and clinical data can be interpreted in different ways. Accordingly, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities could interpret these data in different ways from us or our partners, which could delay, limit or prevent full or accelerated regulatory approval. If our study data do not consistently or sufficiently demonstrate the safety or efficacy of any of our product candidates, the regulatory approvals for such product candidates could be significantly delayed as we work to meet approval requirements, or, if we are not able to meet these requirements, such approvals could be withheld or withdrawn. Fast track product, breakthrough therapy, priority review, or Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (“RMAT”) designation by the FDA, or access to the Priority Medicine scheme (“PRIME”) by the EMA, for our product candidates, if granted, may not lead to faster development or regulatory review or approval process, and it does not increase the likelihood that our product candidates will receive marketing approval. We may seek fast track, breakthrough therapy designation, RMAT designation, PRIME scheme access or priority review designation for our product candidates if supported by the results of clinical trials. A fast track product designation is designed to facilitate the clinical development and expedite the review of drugs intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition which demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. A RMAT designation is designed to accelerate approval for regenerative advanced therapies such as our gene therapy product candidates. Priority review designation is intended to speed the FDA marketing application review timeframe for drugs that treat a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a - 48 - significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. PRIME is a scheme provided by the EMA to enhance support for the development of medicines that target an unmet medical need. For drugs and biologics that have been designated as fast track products or breakthrough therapies, or granted access to the PRIME scheme, interaction and communication between the regulatory agency and the sponsor of the trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development. Sponsors of drugs with fast track products or breakthrough therapies may also be able to submit marketing applications on a rolling basis, meaning that the FDA may review portions of a marketing application before the sponsor submits the complete application to the FDA, if the sponsor pays the user fee upon submission of the first portion of the marketing application. For products that receive a priority review designation, the FDA's marketing application review goal is shortened to six months, as opposed to ten months under standard review. This review goal is based on the date the FDA accepts the marketing application for review, this application validation period typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. RMAT designations will accelerate approval and will include all the benefits of fast track and breakthrough therapy designations, including early interactions with the FDA, but the exact mechanisms have not yet been announced by FDA. Designation as a fast track product, breakthrough therapy, RMAT, PRIME, or priority review product is within the discretion of the regulatory agency. Accordingly, even if we believe one of our product candidates meets the criteria for designation as a fast track product, breakthrough therapy, RMAT, PRIME, or priority review product, the agency may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation. In any event, the receipt of such a designation for a product candidate may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional regulatory procedures and does not assure ultimate marketing approval by the agency. In addition, regarding fast track products and breakthrough therapies, the FDA may later decide that the products no longer meet the conditions for qualification as either a fast track product, RMAT, or a breakthrough therapy or, for priority review products, decide that period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. We may not be able to advance all of our programs, and we may use our financial and human resources to pursue particular programs and fail to capitalize on programs that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success. Our pipeline includes more than 40 programs in various stages of development for a broad range of diseases and disorders. We plan to expand our pipeline through internal research and development and through strategic transactions. Because we have limited resources, we may not be able to advance all of our programs. We may also forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with certain programs or for indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs for product candidates may not yield any commercially viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through strategic collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate, or we may allocate internal resources to a product candidate in a therapeutic area in which it would have been more advantageous to enter into a partnering arrangement. Risks Related to Third Parties If we are unable to maintain our agreements with third parties to distribute our products to patients, our results of operations and business could be adversely affected. We rely on third parties to commercially distribute our products to patients in the U.S. We have contracted with a third-party logistics company to warehouse our products and with distributors and specialty pharmacies to sell and distribute our products to patients. A specialty pharmacy is a pharmacy that specializes in the dispensing of medications for complex or chronic conditions that require a high level of patient education and ongoing management. This distribution network requires significant coordination with our sales and marketing and finance organizations. In addition, failure to coordinate financial systems could negatively impact our ability to accurately report product revenue from our products. If we are unable to effectively manage the distribution process, the sales of our products, as well as any future products we may commercialize, could be delayed or severely compromised and our results of operations may be harmed. - 49 - In addition, the use of third parties involves certain risks, including, but not limited to, risks that these organizations will: Any such events may result in decreased product sales, lower product revenue, loss of revenue, and/or reputational damage, which would harm our results of operations and business. With respect to the pre-commercial distribution of our products to patients outside of the U.S., we have contracted with third party distributors and service providers to distribute our products in certain countries through our EAP. We will need to continue building out our network for commercial distribution in jurisdictions in which our products are approved, which will also require third party contracts. The use of distributors and service providers involves certain risks, including, but not limited to, risks that these organizations will not comply with applicable laws and regulations, or not provide us with accurate or timely information regarding serious adverse events and/or product complaints regarding our products. Any such events may result in regulatory actions that may include suspension or termination of the distribution and sale of our products in a certain country, loss of revenue, and/or reputational damage, which could harm our results of operations and business. Furthermore, a significant outbreak of COVID-19 at one of our third-party logistics, distribution, or specialty pharmacy sites could lead to a delay in the commercial or pre-commercial shipments of our products to patients and hospitals. We rely on third parties to conduct some aspects of our early stage research and pre-clinical and clinical development. The inadequate performance by or loss of any of these third parties could affect the development and commercialization of our product candidate development. We have relied upon, and plan to continue to rely upon, third parties to conduct some aspects of our early stage research and pre-clinical and clinical development with respect to certain of our product candidates, including our follow-on exon-skipping product candidates, PPMO, gene therapy and gene editing product candidates. Our third-party collaborators may not commit sufficient resources or adequately develop our programs for these candidates. If our third-party collaborators fail to commit sufficient resources to any of our product candidates or to carry out their contractual duties or obligations, our programs related to any particular product candidate could be delayed, terminated, or unsuccessful. Furthermore, if we fail to make required payments to these third-party collaborators, including up-front, milestone, reimbursement or royalty payments, or to observe other obligations in our agreements with them, these third parties may not be required to perform their obligations under our respective agreements with them and may have the right to terminate such agreements. In addition, if our strategic partners experience regulatory delays for the development of their clinical product candidates, including clinical holds, our opportunities to commercialize products may be delayed. We also have relied upon and plan to continue to rely upon third-party CROs to monitor and manage data completeness for our ongoing pre-clinical and clinical programs. We rely on these parties for execution of our pre-clinical and clinical trials, and we control only certain aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol and legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on collaborators and CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. The individuals at our third-party collaborators and CROs who conduct work on our behalf, including their sub-contractors, are not always our employees, and although we participate in the planning of our early stage research and pre-clinical and clinical programs, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources or exercise appropriate oversight of these programs, except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such third parties. If our collaborators and CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our pre-clinical and clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates. As a result, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed. - 50 - Our reliance on third parties requires us to share our proprietary information, which increases the possibility that a competitor will discover them or that our proprietary information will be misappropriated or inadvertently disclosed. Our reliance on third-party collaborators requires us to disclose our proprietary information to these parties, which could increase the risk that a competitor will discover this information or that this information will be misappropriated or disclosed without our intent to do so. If any of these events were to occur, then our ability to obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights could be irrevocably jeopardized, and costly, distracting litigation could ensue. Furthermore, if these third parties cease to continue operations and we are not able to quickly find a replacement provider or we lose information or items associated with our products or product candidates, our development programs may be delayed. Although we carefully manage our relationships with our third-party collaborators and CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects. Risks Related to Manufacturing We currently rely on third parties to manufacture our products and to produce our product candidates; our dependence on these parties, including failure on our part to accurately anticipate product demand and timely secure manufacturing capacity to meet commercial, EAP, clinical and pre-clinical product demand may impair the availability of product for commercial supply or to successfully support various programs, including research and development and the potential commercialization of additional product candidates in our pipeline. We currently do not have the internal capacity to manufacture our commercial products or product candidates in the quantities needed to meet commercial, clinical or EAPs demand for our products, or to conduct our research and development programs and conduct clinical trials. Therefore, we rely on, and expect to continue relying on for the foreseeable future, a limited number of third parties to manufacture and supply materials (including raw materials and subunits), API and drug product, as well as to perform additional steps in the manufacturing process, such as labeling and packaging of vials and storage of our products and product candidates. As of the date of this Annual Report, we have dual sourcing for the APIs and drug product for all three of our commercial products. The limited number of third parties with facilities and capabilities suited for the manufacturing process of our products and product candidates creates a risk that we may not be able to obtain materials and APIs in the quantity and purity that we require. In addition, the process for adding new manufacturing capacity is lengthy and often causes delays in development efforts. Any interruption of the development or operation of those facilities due to, among other reasons, events such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, order delays for equipment or materials, equipment malfunctions, quality control and quality assurance issues, regulatory delays and possible negative effects of such delays on supply chains and expected timelines for product availability, production yield issues, shortages of qualified personnel, discontinuation of a facility or business or failure or damage to a facility by natural disasters, such as earthquakes or fires, could result in the cancellation of shipments, loss of product in the manufacturing process or a shortfall in supply of our products, product candidates or materials. If these third parties cease providing quality manufacturing and related services to us, and we are not able to engage appropriate replacements in a timely manner, our ability to manufacture our products or product candidates in sufficient quality and quantity required for our planned commercial, pre-clinical and clinical or EAPs, our various product research, development and commercialization efforts would be adversely affected. Furthermore, any problems in our manufacturing process or the facilities with which we contract make us a less attractive collaborator for potential partners, including larger pharmaceutical companies and academic research institutions, which could limit our access to additional attractive development programs. We, through our third-party manufacturers, seek to produce or produce supply of our products and product candidates. In light of the limited number of third parties with the expertise to produce our products and product candidates, the lead time needed to manufacture them, and the availability of underlying materials, we may not be able to, in a timely manner or at all, establish or maintain sufficient commercial and other manufacturing arrangements on the commercially reasonable terms necessary to provide adequate supply of our products and product candidates. Furthermore, we may not be able to obtain the significant financial capital that may be required in connection with such arrangements. Even after successfully engaging third parties to execute the manufacturing process for our products and product candidates, such parties may not comply with the terms and timelines they have agreed to for various reasons, some of which may be out of their or our control, which impacts our ability to execute our business plans on expected or required timelines in connection with the commercialization of our products and the continued development of our product candidates. When we enter into long-term manufacturing agreements that contain exclusivity provisions and /or substantial termination penalties, we constrain our operational flexibility. - 51 - The operations at one of our partner sites could also be disturbed by man-made or natural disasters or public health pandemics or epidemics or other business interrupts. For example, a significant outbreak of COVID-19 at one of our partner sites could lead to delays in the manufacturing of our products and product candidates. In addition, the need to prioritize rated orders issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency pursuant to the U.S. Defense Production Act could impact the manufacturing, supply chain and distribution of our products and product candidates. The third parties we use in the manufacturing process for our products and product candidates may fail to comply with cGMP regulations. Our contract manufacturers are required to produce our materials, APIs and drug products under cGMP. We and our contract manufacturers are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA, EMA and corresponding state and foreign authorities to ensure strict compliance with cGMP and other applicable government regulations. In addition, before we can begin to commercially manufacture our product candidates in third-party or our own facilities, we must obtain regulatory approval from the FDA, which includes a review of the manufacturing process and facility. A manufacturing authorization also must be obtained from the appropriate EU regulatory authorities and may be required by other foreign regulatory authorities. The timeframe required to obtain such approval or authorization is uncertain. In order to obtain approval, we need to demonstrate that all of our processes, methods and equipment are compliant with cGMP, and perform extensive audits of vendors, contract laboratories and suppliers. In complying with cGMP, we are obligated to expend time, money and effort in production, record keeping and quality control to seek to assure that the product meets applicable specifications and other requirements. We do not have direct operational control over a third-party manufacturer’s compliance with regulations and requirements. In addition, changes in cGMP could negatively impact the ability of our contract manufacturers to complete the manufacturing process of our products and product candidates in a compliant manner on the schedule we require for commercial and clinical trial use, respectively. Failure to achieve and maintain compliance with cGMP and other applicable government regulations, including failure to detect or control anticipated or unanticipated manufacturing errors, results in product recalls, clinical holds, delayed or withheld approvals, patient injury or death. Failure by our contract manufacturers to adhere to applicable cGMP and other applicable government regulations, or our contract manufacturers experiencing manufacturing problems, may result in significant negative consequences, including product seizures or recalls, postponement or cancellation of clinical trials, loss or delay of product approval, fines and sanctions, loss of revenue, termination of the development of a product candidate, reputational damage, shipment delays, inventory shortages, inventory write-offs and other product-related charges and increased manufacturing costs. If we experience any of these consequences, the success of our commercialization of our products and/or our development efforts for our product candidates could be significantly delayed, fail or otherwise be negatively impacted. We may not be able to successfully scale up manufacturing of our products or product candidates in sufficient quality and quantity or within targeted timelines, or be able to secure ownership of intellectual property rights developed in this process, which could negatively impact the commercial success of our products and/or the development of our product candidates. We are working to increase manufacturing capacity and scale up production of some of the components of our drug products. Our focus remains on (i) achieving larger-scale manufacturing capacity for our products and product candidates throughout the manufacturing supply chain, (ii) continuing to increase material and API production capacity to provide the anticipated amounts of drug product needed for our planned studies for our product candidates and (iii) optimizing manufacturing for our follow-on exon skipping product candidates and other programs, including PPMO and gene therapy. We may not be able to successfully increase manufacturing capacity or scale up the production of materials, APIs and drug products, whether in collaboration with third party manufacturers or on our own, in a manner that is safe, compliant with cGMP conditions or other applicable legal or regulatory requirements, in a cost-effective manner, in a time frame required to meet our timeline for commercialization, clinical trials and other business plans, or at all. Challenges complying with cGMP requirements and other quality issues arise during efforts to increase manufacturing capacity and scale up production. We experience such issues in connection with manufacturing, packaging and storage of our products and product candidates, and during shipping and storage of the APIs or finished drug product. In addition, in order to release our products for commercial use and demonstrate stability of product candidates for use in clinical trials (and any subsequent drug products for commercial use), our manufacturing processes and analytical methods must be validated in accordance with regulatory guidelines. Failure to successfully validate, or maintain validation of, our manufacturing processes and analytical methods or demonstrate adequate purity, stability or comparability of our products or product candidates in a timely or cost-effective manner, or at all, may undermine our commercial efforts. Failure to successfully validate our manufacturing processes and analytical methods or to demonstrate adequate purity, stability or comparability, will negatively impact the commercial availability of our products and the continued development and/or regulatory approval of our product candidates, which could significantly harm our business. - 52 - During our work with our third-party manufacturers to increase and optimize manufacturing capacity and scale up production, they may make proprietary improvements in the manufacturing and scale-up processes for our products or product candidates. We may not own or be able to secure ownership of such improvements or may have to share the intellectual property rights to those improvements. Additionally, we may need additional processes, technologies and validation studies, which could be costly and which we may not be able to develop or acquire from third parties. Failure to secure the intellectual property rights required for the manufacturing process needed for large-scale clinical trials or commercialization of our products or the continued development of our product candidates could cause significant delays in our business plans or otherwise negatively impact the commercialization of our products or the continued development of our product candidates. Products intended for use in gene therapies are novel, complex and difficult to manufacture. We could experience production problems that result in delays in our development or commercialization of gene therapy programs, limit the supply of our products or otherwise harm our business. We currently have development, manufacturing and testing agreements with third parties to manufacture supplies of our gene therapy product candidates. Several factors could cause production interruptions, including equipment malfunctions, facility contamination, raw material shortages or contamination, natural disasters, disruption in utility services, human error or disruptions in the operations of suppliers. The physical and chemical properties of biologics such as ours generally cannot be fully characterized. As a result, assays of the finished product may not be sufficient to ensure that the product will perform in the intended manner. Accordingly, we employ multiple steps to control our manufacturing process to assure that the process works and the product candidate is made strictly and consistently in compliance with the process. Problems with the manufacturing process, even minor deviations from the normal process, could result in product defects or manufacturing failures that result in lot failures, product recalls, product liability claims or insufficient inventory. We may encounter problems achieving adequate quantities and quality of clinical and/or commercial-grade materials that meet FDA, EMA or other applicable foreign standards or specifications with consistent and acceptable production yields and costs. In addition, the FDA, the EMA and other foreign regulatory authorities may require us to submit samples of any lot of any approved product together with the protocols showing the results of applicable tests at any time. Under some circumstances, the FDA, the EMA or other foreign regulatory authorities may require that we not distribute a lot until the competent authority authorizes its release. Slight deviations in the manufacturing process, including those affecting quality attributes and stability and deviations among different sites, may result in unacceptable changes in the product that could result in lot failures or product recalls. Lot failures or product recalls could cause us to delay clinical trials or product launches which could be costly to us and otherwise harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. As our product candidates advance to later stage clinical trials, it is customary that various aspects of the development program, such as manufacturing, formulation and other processes, and methods of administration, may be altered to optimize the candidates and processes for scale-up necessary for later stage clinical trials and potential approval and commercialization. These changes may not produce the intended optimization, including production of drug substance and drug product of a quality and in a quantity sufficient for Phase 3 clinical stage development or for commercialization, which may cause delays in the initiation or completion of clinical trials and greater costs. We may also need to conduct additional studies to demonstrate comparability between newly manufactured drug substance and/or drug product for commercialization relative to previously manufactured drug substance and/or drug product for clinical trials. Demonstrating comparability may require us to incur additional costs or delay initiation or completion of clinical trials and, if unsuccessful, could require us to complete additional pre-clinical studies or clinical trials. We also may encounter problems hiring and retaining the experienced scientific, quality control and manufacturing personnel needed to operate our manufacturing process which could result in delays in our production or difficulties in maintaining compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. Furthermore, no manufacturer currently has the capacity and scalability to produce our vectors or gene therapy product candidates at commercial levels. Even if we timely develop a manufacturing process and successfully transfer it to the third-party vector and product manufacturers or successfully and timely develop our internal capacity, if we or such third-party manufacturers are unable to produce the necessary quantities of viral vectors and our product candidates, or in compliance with GMP or other pertinent regulatory requirements, and within our planned time frame and cost parameters, it may result in delays in our development plans or increased capital expenditures, and the development and sales of our products, if approved, may be materially harmed. - 53 - Risks Related to our Intellectual Property Our success, competitive position and future revenue depend in part on our ability and the abilities of our licensors and other collaborators to obtain, maintain and defend the patent protection for our products, product candidates, and platform technologies, to preserve our trade secrets, and to prevent third parties from infringing on our proprietary rights. We currently directly hold various issued patents and patent applications, or have exclusive license or option rights to issued patents and patent applications, in each case in the U.S. as well as other countries that protect our products, product candidates and platform technologies. We anticipate filing additional patent applications both in the U.S. and in other countries. Our success will depend, in significant part, on our ability to obtain, maintain and defend our U.S. and foreign patents covering our products, product candidates and platform technologies as well as preserving our trade secrets for these assets. The patent process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining, maintaining, or defending our patents. Even when our patent claims are allowed, the claims may not issue, or in the event of issuance, may not be sufficient to protect our products, product candidates or platform technologies. The patent positions of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. This uncertainty is heightened for our PMO-based products and product candidates and gene therapy-based product candidates for which there has been little patent litigation involving such technologies. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents has emerged to date in the U.S. and tests used for determining the patentability of patent claims in all technologies are in flux. The USPTO and patent offices in other jurisdictions have often required that patent applications concerning pharmaceutical and/or biotechnology-related inventions be limited or narrowed substantially to cover only the specific innovations exemplified in the patent application, thereby limiting the scope of protection against competitive challenges. Accordingly, even if we or our licensors are able to obtain patents, the patents might be substantially narrower than anticipated. Thus, there is no assurance as to the degree and range of protections any of our patents, if issued, may afford us or whether patents will be issued. Patents which may be issued to us may be subjected to further governmental review that may ultimately result in the reduction of their scope of protection, and pending patent applications may have their requested breadth of protection significantly limited before being issued, if issued at all. The pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences patent situation outside the U.S. can be even more uncertain. As a matter of public policy, there might be significant pressure on governmental bodies to limit the scope of patent protection or impose compulsory licenses for disease treatments that prove successful, particularly as a tactic to impose a price control. Additionally, competitors may leverage such pressure to enhance their ability to exploit these laws to create, develop and market competing products. We may be able to assert that certain activities engaged in by our competitors infringe on our current or future patent rights. To the extent that we enforce our patents, an alleged infringer may deny infringement and/or counter-claim that our patents are not valid, and if successful, could negatively impact our patent estate. We may not be able to successfully defend patents necessary to prevent competitors from developing or commercializing competing product candidates or products. To the extent we assert infringement of a patent that covers a competing product candidate or product as well as our own product candidate(s) or product(s), or such a patent is otherwise challenged without our initiation, the patent protection for our own product candidate(s) or product(s) could be materially adversely affected should an infringing competitor be successful challenging the validity of our patent. Our patent rights might be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or otherwise not provide any competitive advantage. Defending our patent positions may require significant financial resources and could negatively impact other Company objectives. Even if we successfully enforce our patent rights against a competitor, we may not be able to recover adequate damages or obtain other desired relief. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, one or more motivated third parties may file an ANDA, seeking approval of a generic copy of an innovator product approved under the NDA pathway such as our PMO products, or an NDA under Section 505(b)(2), which may be for a new or improved version of the original innovator products. In certain circumstances, motivated third parties may file such an ANDA or NDA under Section 505(b)(2) as early as the so-called “NCE-1” date that is one year before the expiry of the five-year period of New Chemical Entity exclusivity or more generally four years after NDA approval. The third parties are allowed to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the innovator’s product, may not need to conduct clinical trials and can market a competing version of a product after the expiration or loss of patent exclusivity or the expiration or loss of regulatory exclusivity and often charge significantly lower prices. Upon the expiration or loss of patent protection or the expiration or loss of regulatory exclusivity for a product, the major portion of revenues for that product may be dramatically reduced in a very short period of time. If we are not successful in defending our patents and regulatory exclusivities, we will not derive the expected benefit from them. As such, a third party could be positioned to market an ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) product that competes with one of our products prior to the expiry of our patents if the third party successfully challenged the validity of our patents protecting the product. The patent landscape is continually evolving, and we may be able to assert that certain activities engaged in by third parties infringe our current or future patent rights. There has been, and we believe that there will continue to be, significant litigation in the biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical industries regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. As such, the patents and patent applications that we own, license, have optioned, and rely on for exclusivity for our product candidates may be challenged. - 54 - Uncertainty over intellectual property in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry has been the source of litigation and other disputes, which is inherently costly and unpredictable. Litigation, interferences, oppositions, inter partes reviews, administrative challenges or other similar types of proceedings are, have been and may in the future be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of certain of our proprietary rights, and in other instances to determine the validity, scope or non-infringement of certain patent rights claimed by third parties to be pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our product candidates or products. We may also face challenges to our patent and regulatory exclusivities covering our products by third parties, including manufacturers of generics and biosimilars that may choose to launch or attempt to launch their products before the expiration of our patent or regulatory exclusivity. Litigation, interferences, oppositions, inter partes reviews, administrative challenges or other similar types of proceedings are unpredictable and may be protracted, expensive and distracting to management. The outcomes of such proceedings could adversely affect the validity and scope of our patents or other proprietary rights, hinder our ability to manufacture and market our products, require us to seek a license for the infringed products or technology or result in the assessment of significant monetary damages against us that may exceed amounts, if any, accrued in our financial statements. An adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or a failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from developing, manufacturing or selling our products. Furthermore, payments under any licenses that we are able to obtain would reduce our profits derived from our products. Any of these circumstances could result in financial, business or reputational harm to us or could cause a decline or volatility in our stock price. On September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (the “Leahy-Smith Act”), was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law, including provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted, and may also affect patent litigation. The USPTO has issued regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act. In view of the long timelines for interpreting legal provisions in the court system and the evolving nature of our laws, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. For instance, a third party may petition the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“PTAB”) seeking to challenge some or all of the claims in any of our patents through an inter partes review or other post-grant proceeding. Should the PTAB institute an inter partes review or other proceeding and decide that some or all of the claims in the challenged patent are unpatentable or invalid, such a decision, if upheld on appeal, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Our business prospects will be impaired if third parties successfully assert that our products, product candidates, or platform technologies infringe proprietary rights of such third parties. Similar to us, competitors continually seek intellectual property protection for their technology. Several of our development programs, particularly gene therapy programs, focus on therapeutic areas that have been the subject of extensive research and development by third parties for many years and have been protected with third party patent rights. Due to the amount of intellectual property in our various fields of technology, we cannot be certain that we do not infringe intellectual property rights of competitors or other third parties or that we will not infringe intellectual property rights of competitors or other third parties granted or created in the future. Moreover, activities we conduct or those conducted on our behalf in connection with the development of our product candidates may not be protected from infringement under the so-called Safe Harbor of the Hatch-Waxman Act and thus be found to infringe the patent rights of third parties. Our competitors or other third parties might have obtained, or could obtain in the future, patents that threaten, limit, interfere with or eliminate our ability to make, use and sell our products, product candidates or platform technologies in important commercial markets. Due to the nature of our various partnerships, collaborators, licensors, CROs, CMOs and the like, we may be subjected to claims of infringement arising from activities conducted by these third parties in connection with our product candidates, whether or not such activities are authorized by us. In addition, we may have contractual obligations to indemnify these partners from claims of infringement or declaratory relief. As a result, we may be subject to substantial unforeseen costs, distraction, and financial liability if a third party making such a claim was successful in obtaining a final judgment of infringement and validity. In order to maintain or obtain freedom to operate for our products and product candidates, we may incur significant expenses, including those associated with entering into agreements with third parties that require milestone and royalty payments. Additionally, if we were to challenge the patent rights of our competitors or otherwise defend against allegations of infringement, misappropriation, breach of contract or related claims, we could incur substantial costs and ultimately might not be successful. If our products, product candidates, or platform technologies are alleged to infringe or are determined to infringe enforceable proprietary rights of others, we could incur substantial costs and may have to: - 55 - Any of these events could result in product and product candidate development delays or cessation, and as such substantially harm our potential earnings, financial condition and operations. The patent landscape of our product candidates and products is continually evolving and multiple parties, including both commercial entities and academic institutions, may have rights to claims or may be pursuing additional claims that could provide these parties a basis to assert that our products, product candidates or platform technologies infringe on the intellectual property rights of such parties. There has been, and we believe that there will continue to be, significant litigation in the biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical industries regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Risks Related to our Business Operations Failure to comply with healthcare and other regulations is subject to substantial penalties and our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. As a manufacturer of pharmaceuticals, within the U.S., certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations apply to or affect our business. The laws and regulations include: The number and complexity of both federal and state laws continues to increase; the laws contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation; government interpretations of the laws continue to evolve; and additional governmental resources are being used to enforce these laws and to prosecute companies and individuals who are believed to be violating them. We anticipate that government scrutiny of pharmaceutical sales and marketing practices will continue for the foreseeable future and subject us to the risk of government investigations and enforcement actions. We have implemented a compliance program, which is based on industry best practices and is designed to ensure that our activities comply with all applicable laws, regulations and industry standards. While our compliance program is intended to detect and prevent potential non-compliance, we cannot be certain that compliance will be assured. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other laws, rules or regulations that apply to us, we will be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Responding to government investigations, defending any claims raised, and any resulting fines, restitution, damages and penalties, settlement payments or administrative actions, as well as any related actions brought by stockholders or other third parties, could have a material impact on our reputation, business and financial condition and divert the attention of our management from operating our business. Even if we successfully defend against an action against us for violation of a law, the action and our defense could - 56 - nonetheless cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state privacy, security, fraud and reporting laws may prove costly. If we, our collaborators, or any third-party manufacturers engaged by us or our collaborators fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could harm our business. We, our collaborators, and any third-party manufacturers we engage are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the generation, handling, use, storage, treatment, manufacture, transportation and disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous materials and wastes, as well as laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety, including those governing laboratory procedures, exposure to blood-borne pathogens and the handling of bio-hazardous materials. Our operations involve the use of hazardous materials, including organic and inorganic solvents and reagents. Although we believe that our activities conform in all material respects with such environmental laws, there can be no assurance that violations of these laws will not occur in the future as a result of human error, accident, equipment failure or other causes. Liability under environmental, health and safety laws can be joint and several and without regard to fault or negligence. The failure to comply with past, present or future laws could result in the imposition of substantial fines and penalties, remediation costs, property damage and personal injury claims, loss of permits or a cessation of operations, and any of these events could harm our business and financial condition. We expect that our operations will be affected by other new environmental, health and workplace safety laws on an ongoing basis, and although we cannot predict the ultimate impact of any such new laws, they may impose greater compliance costs or result in increased risks or penalties, which could harm our business. Further, with respect to the operations of any current or future collaborators or third party contract manufacturers, it is possible that if they fail to operate in compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or properly dispose of wastes associated with our product or product candidates, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, suffer reputational harm or experience a disruption in the manufacture and supply of our product or product candidates. Comprehensive tax reform in the U.S. and future guidance could adversely affect our business and financial condition. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”) was enacted on December 22, 2017 in the U.S. The TCJA contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, elimination of U.S. tax on foreign earnings (subject to certain important exceptions), one-time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense, immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits. On March 27, 2020, President Trump signed into law the “Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act” or the CARES Act, which included certain changes in tax law intended to stimulate the U.S. economy in light of the COVID-19 outbreak, including temporary beneficial changes to the treatment of net operating losses, interest deductibility limitations and payroll tax matters. We continue to monitor changes in tax laws in the U.S. and the impact of proposed and enacted legislation in the international jurisdictions in which the company operates. President Biden has provided informal guidance on tax law changes he may support. Among other things, his proposals would raise the rate on both domestic and foreign income. If any of these proposals are ultimately enacted into legislation, they could materially impact our tax provision, cash tax liability and effective tax rate. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted, and may continue to result in disruptions to our commercialization, clinical trials, manufacturing and other business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and prospects. The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a substantial public health and economic challenge around the world. The rapid spread of COVID-19 has led to the implementation of various responses, including government-imposed quarantines, shelter-in-place mandates, sweeping restrictions on travel, mandatory shutdowns for non-essential businesses, requirements regarding social distancing, and other public health safety measures, as well as reported adverse impacts on healthcare resources, facilities and providers across the United States and in other countries. In response to the pandemic, healthcare providers have, and may need to further, reallocate resources, such as physicians, staff, hospital beds, and intensive care unit facilities, as they prioritize limited resources and personnel capacity to focus on the treatment of patients with COVID-19 and implement limitations on access to hospitals and other medical institutions due to concerns about the spread of COVID-19 in such settings. These responses may be extended by the duration of the outbreak, periodic spikes in infection rates due to new strains of the virus including Delta, Omicron or otherwise, local outbreaks of the virus, the broad availability of effective vaccines, new information that will emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and the actions to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact. These actions have and may continue to negatively impact commercialization, clinical trials, manufacturing and other business operations, including: - 57 - Any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and prospects. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our operations and those of our third-party partners will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the pandemic, additional or modified government actions, new information which emerges concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions taken to contain the virus or treat its impact, among others. In particular, the speed of the continued spread of COVID-19 globally, and the magnitude of interventions to contain the spread of the virus, will determine the impact of the pandemic on our operations. Our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset future taxable income may be limited as a result of future transactions involving our common stock. In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, a corporation that undergoes an ""ownership change"" is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses and certain other tax assets to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders increases by more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders’ lowest percentage ownership during the testing period, which is generally three years. An ownership change could limit our ability to utilize our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for taxable years including or following such “ownership change.” Limitations imposed on the ability to use net operating losses and tax credits to offset future taxable income could require us to pay U.S. federal income taxes earlier than we estimated or than would have otherwise been required if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such net operating losses and tax credits to expire unused, in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such net operating losses and tax credits and potentially adversely affecting our financial position. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes. - 58 - We are winding down our expired U.S. government contracts, and the U.S. government may deny payment of some or all of the currently outstanding amounts owed to us. In addition, further development of our infectious disease programs may be limited by the intellectual property and other rights retained by the U.S. government. We have historically relied on U.S. government contracts and awards to fund and support certain infectious disease development programs. These contracts expired and we are currently involved in contract close-out activities. The U.S. government has the right to perform additional audits prior to making final payment of costs and fees. If we are not able to adequately support costs incurred or other government requirements, the government may deny payment of some or all of the currently outstanding amounts owed to us. In addition, the U.S. government may have the right to develop all or some parts of product candidates that we have developed under a U.S. government contract after such contract has terminated or expired. Our employees, principal investigators, consultants and strategic partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading. We are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees, principal investigators, consultants and strategic partners. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional failures to comply with the regulations of the FDA and non-U.S. regulators, provide accurate information to the FDA and non-U.S. regulators, comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. We adopted a code of conduct applicable to all of our employees, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions. Failure to retain our key personnel or an inability to attract and retain additional qualified personnel would cause our future growth and our ability to compete to suffer. We are highly dependent on the efforts and abilities of the principal members of our senior management. Additionally, we have scientific personnel with significant and unique expertise in RNA-targeted therapeutics and gene therapy technologies. The loss of the services of any one of the principal members of our managerial team or staff may prevent us from achieving our business objectives. The competition for qualified personnel in the biotechnology field is intense, and our future success depends upon our ability to attract, retain, motivate and support such personnel. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated workforce competition and workforce shortages. In order to develop and commercialize our products successfully, we will be required to retain key management and scientific employees. In certain instances, we may also need to expand or replace our workforce and our management ranks. In addition, we rely on certain consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in the formulation and advancement of our research and development programs. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by other entities or have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with third parties that limit their availability to us, or both. If we are unable to attract, assimilate or retain such key personnel, our ability to advance our programs would be adversely affected. Turnover rates of key employees continues to vary substantially during the pandemic. Over the last two years, we have had several executive management changes. Leadership transitions can be inherently difficult to manage and may cause uncertainty or a disruption to our business or may increase the likelihood of turnover in other key officers and employees. If we lose the services of one or more of our senior management or key employees, or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise to compete with us, our business could be harmed. - 59 - Risks Related to our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements We have incurred operating losses since our inception and we may not achieve or sustain profitability. We incurred an operating loss of $459.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our accumulated deficit was $3.2 billion as of December 31, 2021. Although we currently have three commercially approved products in the U.S., we believe that it will take us some time to attain profitability and positive cash flow from operations. Since our products and product candidates target small patient populations, the per-patient drug pricing must be high in order to recover our development and manufacturing costs, fund adequate patient support programs, fund additional research and achieve profitability. We may be unable to maintain or obtain sufficient sales volumes at a price high enough to justify our product development efforts and our sales, marketing and manufacturing expenses. We have generally incurred expenses related to research and development of our technologies and product candidates and from general and administrative expenses that we have incurred while building our business infrastructure. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if and/or as we: As a result, we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses at least through 2021. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing biopharmaceutical products, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when, or if, we will become profitable. We will need to raise additional funding, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed may force us to delay, limit or terminate our product development efforts or other operations. We will likely require additional capital from time to time in the future in order to meet FDA post-marketing approval requirements and market and sell our products as well as to continue the development of product candidates in our pipeline, to prepare for potential commercialization of additional product candidates in our pipeline, to expand our product portfolio and to continue or enhance our business development efforts. The actual amount of funds that we may need and the sufficiency of the capital we have or are able to raise will be determined by many factors, some of which are in our control and others that are beyond our control. While we are currently well capitalized, we may use available capital resources sooner than we expect under our current operating plan. In addition, our operating plan may change. We may need or choose to seek additional funds sooner than planned, through equity or debt financings, government or other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic alliances, funded research and development arrangements and licensing arrangements or a combination of these approaches. In any event, we expect to require additional capital to expand future development efforts, obtain regulatory approval for, and to commercialize, our product candidates. Raising funds in the current economic environment may present additional challenges. Even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans, we may seek additional capital if market conditions are favorable or in light of specific strategic considerations. - 60 - Any additional fundraising efforts may divert our management from their day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates. In addition, we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In the event we receive negative data from our key clinical programs or encounter other major setbacks in our development, manufacturing or regulatory activities or in our commercialization efforts, our stock price is likely to decline, which would make a future financing more difficult. Moreover, the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders. The issuance of additional securities, whether equity or debt, by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our shares to decline. The sale of additional equity or convertible securities may dilute all of our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness may result in increased fixed payment obligations and we may be required to agree to certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. We could also be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or otherwise at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable and we may be required to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product candidates or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects. If we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, we may be required to significantly curtail, delay or discontinue one or more of our research or development programs or the commercialization of any product, if approved, or be unable to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, as desired, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Raising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights. We may seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations and strategic and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of common stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock, the ownership interest of our stockholders in our company may be diluted. In addition, the terms of any such securities may include liquidation or other preferences that materially adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may increase our fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaboration, strategic partnerships and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our product candidates, our intellectual property, future revenue streams or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. The estimates and judgments we make, or the assumptions on which we rely, in preparing our consolidated financial statements could prove inaccurate. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the amounts of charges accrued by us and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Such estimates and judgments include revenue recognition, inventory, valuation of stock-based awards, research and development expenses and income tax. We base our estimates on historical experience, facts and circumstances known to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We cannot provide assurances, however, that our estimates, or the assumptions underlying them, will not change over time or otherwise prove inaccurate. If this is the case, we may be required to restate our consolidated financial statements, which could, in turn, subject us to securities class action litigation. Defending against such potential litigation relating to a restatement of our consolidated financial statements would be expensive and would require significant attention and resources of our management. Moreover, our insurance to cover our obligations with respect to the ultimate resolution of any such litigation may be inadequate. As a result of these factors, any such potential litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cause our stock price to decline, which could in turn subject us to securities class action litigation. Risks Related to Our Common Stock Our stock price is volatile and may fluctuate due to factors beyond our control. The market prices for and trading volumes of securities of biotechnology companies, including our securities, has historically been volatile. Our stock has had significant swings in trading prices, in particular in connection with our public communications regarding feedback received from regulatory authorities. For example, over the last twelve months, as of the date of this report, our stock has increased as much as 16% in a single day or decreased as much as 13% in a single day . The market has from time to time - 61 - experienced significant price and volume fluctuations unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors, including but not limited to: Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of a company’s stock, including ours, regardless of actual operating performance. For example, the trading prices of biopharmaceutical companies have been highly volatile as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which continues to rapidly evolve. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources. Our revenues and operating results could fluctuate significantly, which may adversely affect our stock price. Our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from year-to-year and quarter-to-quarter as well as in comparison to the corresponding quarter of the preceding year. Variations my result from one or more factors, including, without limitation: - 62 - In addition, in one or more future periods, our results of operations may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline. Provisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law might deter acquisition bids for us that might be considered favorable and prevent or frustrate any attempt to replace or remove the then-current management and board of directors. Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or effect a change in our board of directors and management. These provisions include: In addition, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws and in the Delaware General Corporation Law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by the then-current board of directors. - 63 - A significant number of shares of our common stock are issuable pursuant to outstanding stock awards, and we expect to issue additional stock awards and shares of common stock to attract and retain employees, directors and consultants. We may also issue shares of common stock to finance our operations and in connection with our strategic goals. Exercise of these awards and sales of shares will dilute the interests of existing security holders and may depress the price of our common stock. Currently, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 198.0 million shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2021, there were approximately 87.1 million shares of common stock outstanding and outstanding awards to purchase 8.2 million shares of common stock under various incentive stock plans. Additionally, as of December 31, 2021, there were approximately 4.2 million shares of common stock available for future issuance under our 2018 Equity Incentive Plan, approximately 0.4 million shares of common stock available for issuance under our Amended and Restated 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and approximately 1.5 million shares of common stock available for issuance under our 2014 Employment Commencement Incentive Plan. We may issue additional shares to grant equity awards to our employees, officers, directors and consultants under our 2018 Equity Incentive Plan, our 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan or our 2014 Employment Commencement Incentive Plan. We may also issue additional common stock and warrants from time to time to finance our operations and in connection with strategic transactions, such as acquisitions and licensing. For example, in February 2020, we issued and sold 2,522,227 shares of common stock to Roche Finance in connection with the entry into the collaboration agreement with Roche. The issuance of additional shares of common stock or warrants to purchase common stock and the perception that such issuances may occur or exercise of outstanding warrants or stock options may have a dilutive impact on other stockholders and could have a material negative effect on the market price of our common stock. Future sales of our common stock in the public market could cause our share price to fall. Sales of a substantial number of our common stock in the public market, including sales by members of our management or board of directors, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity or equity-related securities. Risks Related to Our Credit Agreement and Convertible Senior Notes Our indebtedness resulting from our credit agreement could adversely affect our financial condition or restrict our future operations. On December 13, 2019, we entered into a loan agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with BioPharma Credit PLC, as the collateral agent and a lender (“BioPharma”), and BioPharma Credit Investments V (Master) LP, as a lender (together with BioPharma in its capacity as a lender, and each of their respective successors and assigns at any time party to the Credit Agreement, the “Lenders” and each a “Lender”) that provides for a senior secured term loan facility (the “Loan Facility”) of up to $500.0 million to be funded in two tranches: (i) a Tranche A Loan in an aggregate principal amount of $250.0 million (the “Tranche A Loan”), which was funded on December 20, 2019; and (ii) a Tranche B Loan in an aggregate principal amount of up to $250.0 million (the “Tranche B Loan”, and together with the Tranche A Loan, the “Term Loans”). We drew the $250.0 million Tranche A Loan in full on December 20, 2019. On September 24, 2020, we entered into a first amendment to loan agreement (the “Amendment”) which amends the Credit Agreement. The Amendment increases the aggregate principal amount of the Tranche B Loan under the Loan Facility from $250.0 million to $300.0 million. On November 2, 2020, we drew the $300.0 million Tranche B Loan. In addition, the Amendment extends the maturity date for the Tranche B Loan to December 31, 2024 and increases the funding fee payable to each Lender providing a portion of the Tranche B Loan on the date the Tranche B Loan is funded by 120 basis points to 2.95%. All obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured pursuant to the terms of a security agreement and subject to certain exceptions, by security interests in certain collateral (collectively, the “Collateral”), which includes the following: (1) any and all U.S. intellectual property owned by, and rights to U.S. intellectual property licensed to, us relating to any pharmaceutical composition in which eteplirsen or golodirsen is indicated to be administered for use in the treatment of Duchenne in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene that is amenable to exon 51 or 53 skipping, respectively, or for any other use approved by the FDA (the “Loan Products”), (2) 100% of the equity interests directly held by us in certain wholly owned domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the equity interests in certain other wholly owned domestic subsidiaries, and (3) all of our personal property, including, without limitation, cash held in all our deposit accounts. Any non-U.S. intellectual property related to the Loan Products and intellectual property unrelated in any way to the Loan Products anywhere are not part of the Collateral. - 64 - The Credit Agreement contains negative covenants that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, restrict our ability to: The Credit Agreement requires us to have consolidated liquidity of at least $100.0 million as of the last day of each month. Additionally, the Credit Agreement contains certain representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and provisions relating to events of default, which include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) nonpayment of principal, interest and other amounts; (ii) failure to comply with covenants; (iii) the occurrence of a material adverse change in (A) our ability to fulfill the payment or performance obligations under the Credit Agreement and related documents or (B) the binding nature of the Credit Agreement and related documents; (iv) the rendering of judgments or orders or the acceleration or payment default by us in respect of other indebtedness in excess of $10.0 million; and (v) certain insolvency and ERISA events. A change of control triggers a mandatory prepayment of the Term Loans, and we may not have sufficient funds or the ability to raise the funds necessary to prepay them. Servicing our Credit Agreement and 1.50% notes due 2024 (the “Notes”) requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow to pay our debt. In 2017, we issued $570.0 million aggregate principal amount of Notes, pursuant to that certain indenture, dated as of November 14, 2019, between us, as issuer, and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness, including the Credit Agreement and the Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to many factors, including, economic, financial, competitive and other, beyond our control. We do not expect our business to be able to generate cash flow from operations in the foreseeable future, sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures and we may therefore be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance the term loan under the Credit Agreement, which matures in 2023, and the Notes, which are non-callable and mature in 2024, will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations, and limit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business. We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to repurchase the Notes as required upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to repurchase the Notes. Holders of the Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their Notes for cash upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. A fundamental change may also constitute an event of default or prepayment under, and result in the acceleration of the maturity of, our then-existing indebtedness. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient financial resources, or will be able to arrange financing, to pay the fundamental change repurchase price in cash with respect to any Notes surrendered by holders for repurchase upon a fundamental change. In addition, restrictions under our then existing credit facilities or other indebtedness, if any, may not allow us to repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change. Our failure to repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change when required would result in an event of default with respect to the Notes which could, in turn, constitute a default under the terms of our other indebtedness, if any. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Notes. Capped call transactions entered into in connection with the Notes may impact the value of our common stock. In connection with the Notes, we entered into capped call transactions (the “Capped Call Transactions”) with certain financial institutions. The Capped Call Transactions are expected to generally reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the Notes into shares of our common stock. - 65 - In connection with establishing their initial hedges of the Capped Call Transactions, these financial institutions or their respective affiliates may have entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock and/or purchased our common stock. The financial institutions, or their respective affiliates, may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Notes. This activity may have an impact on the value of our common stock. General Risks We may be subject to product liability claims and our insurance may not be adequate to cover damages. The current and future use of our product candidates by us and our collaborators in clinical trials, expanded access programs, the sale of our products, or the use of our products under emergency use vehicles may expose us to liability claims inherent to the manufacture, clinical testing, marketing and sale of medical products. These claims might be made directly by consumers or healthcare providers or indirectly by pharmaceutical companies, our collaborators or others selling such products. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, we may experience financial losses in the future due to such product liability claims. We have obtained commercial general liability insurance coverage for our clinical trials and the sale of commercial products. However, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against all losses. If a successful product liability claim or series of claims is brought against us for uninsured liabilities or in excess of insured liabilities, our assets may not be sufficient to cover such claims and our business operations could be impaired. Violation of the General Data Protection Regulation could subject us to significant fines. The GDPR increases our obligations with respect to clinical trials conducted in the member states of the EEA by expanding the definition of personal data to include coded data and requiring changes to informed consent practices and more detailed notices for clinical trial subjects and investigators. In addition, the GDPR increases the scrutiny that clinical trial sites located in the EEA should apply to transfers of personal data from such sites to countries that are considered to lack an adequate level of data protection, such as the U.S. The GDPR imposes substantial fines for breaches of data protection requirements, which can be up to four percent of global revenue or 20 million Euros, whichever is greater, and it also confers a private right of action on data subjects for breaches of data protection requirements. Compliance with these directives will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase our cost of doing business, and despite those efforts, there is a risk that we may be subject to fines and penalties, litigation and reputational harm in connection with our European activities. We have expanded, and may continue to expand, our organization and may experience difficulties in managing this growth, which could disrupt our operations. To support the expansion of our business activities, we have expanded, and may continue to expand, our full-time employee base, as well as our consultant and contractor base. Our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. Our ability to manage our growth properly and maintain compliance with all applicable rules and regulations will require us to continue to improve our operational, legal, financial and management controls, as well as our reporting systems and procedures. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Our growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of additional product candidates. If our management is unable to effectively manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate and/or grow revenues could be reduced, and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally. We are increasing our presence in international markets, including emerging markets, subjecting us to many risks that could adversely affect our business and revenues, such as: - 66 - In addition, our international operations are subject to regulation under U.S. law. For example, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from paying, offering to pay, promising to pay or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to otherwise obtain favorable treatment or influence a person working in an official capacity. In many countries, the healthcare professionals we regularly interact with may meet the FCPA's definition of a foreign government official. Failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences, including: possible delay in approval or refusal to approve a product, recalls, seizures or withdrawal of an approved product from the market, disruption in the supply or availability of our products or suspension of export or import privileges, the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions, the prosecution of executives overseeing our international operations and damage to our reputation. Any significant impairment of our ability to sell products outside of the U.S. could adversely impact our business and financial results. Unfavorable global economic conditions could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our results of operations could be harmed by general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets. A severe or prolonged economic downturn could result in a variety of risks to our business, including weakened demand for our product candidates and our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. A weak or declining economy could strain our manufacturers, possibly resulting in manufacturing disruption, or cause delays in payments for our services by third-party payors or our future collaborators. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the current economic climate and financial market conditions could harm our business. Additionally, in June 2016, a majority of United Kingdom (“UK”) voters voted for the UK to exit the EU (Brexit) and, on January 31, 2020, the UK’s withdrawal became effective. A transition period applied until the end of 2020 during which the pre-Brexit legal regime continued to apply. Existing EU Treaties, EU free movement rights and the general principles of EU law now no longer apply in relation to the UK. EU regulations only continue to apply in UK domestic law (by virtue of the European Union Withdrawal Act of 2018) to the extent that they are not modified or revoked by regulations under that Act. The EU and the UK negotiating teams have agreed the terms of a detailed post-Brexit Trade and Cooperation Agreement which was applied provisionally as of January 1, 2021 and entered into force on May 1, 2021. The economic effects of Brexit will depend the implementation of this Trade and Cooperation Agreement. Brexit could adversely affect European and worldwide economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial markets. Brexit is likely to lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the UK determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. We may face new regulatory costs and challenges as a result of Brexit that could have a material adverse effect on our operations. For example, as of January 1, 2021, the United Kingdom lost the benefits of global trade agreements negotiated by the EU on behalf of its members, which may result in increased trade barriers that could make our doing business in areas that are subject to such global trade agreements more difficult. Any of these effects of Brexit, and any other effects we cannot anticipate, could adversely affect our business, business opportunities, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting the global economy, and the U.S. economy in particular, with the potential for any economic downturn to be severe and prolonged. A severe or prolonged economic downturn as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could result in a variety of risks to our business, including disruptions in the financial markets, which could adversely impact our ability to raise additional capital when needed or on acceptable terms, if at all. We rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology, including any cyber security incidents, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of the patients using our commercially approved products, clinical trial participants and employees. Similarly, our third-party providers possess certain of our sensitive data. - 67 - The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Our ongoing operating activities also depend on functioning computer systems. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure are subject to attacks or breaches. Any such breach could result in a material compromise of our networks, and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost, stolen, or rendered, permanently or temporarily, inaccessible. Furthermore, we may not promptly discover a system intrusion. Attacks could have a material impact on our business, operations or financial results. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information, including our data being breached at third party providers, could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt our operations and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business. We also may need to pay “ransomware” to re-access our systems. In addition, privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements, which increase the costs incurred by us in complying with such laws. The European Union’s GDPR, which greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of European Union law and became effective in May 2018, adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal data including the public disclosure of significant data breaches, and imposes substantial penalties for non-compliance of up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of global annual revenue for the preceding financial year. Our efforts to comply with GDPR and other privacy and data protection laws imposes significant costs and challenges that are likely to increase over time, and we are exposed to substantial penalties or litigation related to violations of existing or future data privacy laws and regulations. Additionally, the CCPA, which became effective January 1, 2020, substantially expands privacy obligations of many businesses. The CCPA requires new disclosures to California consumers, imposes new rules for collecting or using information about minors, and affords consumers new abilities, such as the right to know whether the data is sold or disclosed and to whom, the right to request that a company delete personal information collected, the right to opt-out of the sale of personal information and the right to non-discrimination in terms of price or service when a consumer exercises a privacy right. Failure to comply with these regulations is subject to civil sanctions, including fines and penalties. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. Moreover, a newly passed ballot initiative, the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which will become operational in 2023, expands on the CCPA, creating new consumer rights and protections, including the right to correct personal information, the right to opt out of the use of personal information in automated decision making, the right to opt out of “sharing” consumer’s personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising, and the right to restrict use of and disclosure of sensitive personal information, including geolocation data to third parties. We will need to evaluate and potentially update our privacy program to seek to comply with the CPRA and will incur additional costs and expenses in our effort to comply. We may incur substantial costs in connection with litigation and other disputes. In the ordinary course of business we may, and in some cases have, become involved in lawsuits and other disputes such as securities claims, intellectual property challenges, including interferences declared by the USPTO, and employee matters. It is possible that we may not prevail in claims made against us in such disputes even after expending significant amounts of money and company resources in defending our positions in such lawsuits and disputes. The outcome of such lawsuits and disputes is inherently uncertain and may have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The increasing use of social media platforms presents new risks and challenges. Social media is increasingly being used to communicate about our products, technologies and programs, and the diseases our product and product candidates are designed to treat. Social media practices in the biopharmaceutical industry continue to evolve and regulations relating to such use are not always clear. This evolution creates uncertainty and risk of noncompliance with regulations applicable to our business. For example, patients may use social media channels to comment on the effectiveness of a product or to report an alleged adverse event. When such disclosures occur, there is a risk that we fail to monitor and comply with applicable adverse event reporting obligations or we may not be able to defend ourselves or the public's legitimate interests in the face of the political and market pressures generated by social media due to restrictions on what we may say about our product and/or product candidates. There is also a risk of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information or negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us on any social networking website. If any of these events were to occur or we otherwise fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could incur liability, face overly restrictive regulatory actions or incur other harm to our business. - 68 - We or the third parties upon whom we depend may be adversely affected by natural disasters and/or terrorism attacks, and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster. Natural disasters could severely disrupt our operations, and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. If a natural disaster, power outage, terrorism attack or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our office, manufacturing and/or lab spaces, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as the manufacturing facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place may prove inadequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Item 1B.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis o f Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The purpose of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is to provide an understanding of the financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations of Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Please review our legend titled “Forward-Looking Information” at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K which is incorporated herein by reference. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below, and those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Throughout this discussion, unless the context specifies or implies otherwise, the terms “Sarepta”, “we”, “us” and “our” refer to Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. and its subsidiaries. This section discusses 2021 and 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020. Discussions of 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 have been excluded from this Form 10-K and can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. Overview We are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on helping patients through the discovery and development of unique RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene therapy and other genetic therapeutic modalities for the treatment of rare diseases. Applying our proprietary, highly-differentiated and innovative technologies, and through collaborations with our strategic partners, we are developing potential therapeutic candidates for a broad range of diseases and disorders, including Duchenne, LGMDs, and other CNS related disorders. We commercialize three products, all of which were granted accelerated approval by the FDA: We are in the process of conducting various EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53 and AMONDYS 45 clinical trials, including studies that are required to comply with our post-marketing FDA requirements/commitments to verify and describe the clinical benefit of these products. A summary description of our key product candidates, including those in collaboration with our strategic partners, is as follows: - 72 - Our pipeline includes more than 40 programs in various stages of pre-clinical and clinical development, reflecting our multifaceted approach and expertise in precision genetic medicine to make a profound difference in the lives of patients suffering from rare diseases. We have developed proprietary state-of-the-art CMC and manufacturing capabilities that allow synthesis and purification of our products and product candidates to support both clinical development as well as commercialization. Our current main focus in manufacturing is to continue scaling up production of our PMO-based therapies and optimizing manufacturing for PPMO and gene therapy-based product candidates. We have entered into certain manufacturing and supply arrangements with third-party suppliers and will utilize these capabilities to support production of certain of our products and product candidates and their components. In 2017, we opened a facility in Andover, Massachusetts, which significantly enhanced our research and development manufacturing capabilities. However, we currently do not have internal large scale GMP manufacturing capabilities to produce our products and product candidates for commercial and/or clinical use. The likelihood of our long-term success must be considered in light of the expenses, difficulties and delays frequently encountered in the development and commercialization of new pharmaceutical products, competitive factors in the marketplace and the complex regulatory environment in which we operate. We may never achieve significant revenue or profitable operations. COVID-19 Pandemic The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a substantial public health and economic challenge around the world. Our business operations and financial condition and results have been impacted to varying degrees, and we expect the impact will continue in future quarters. We are continuing to assess the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations and financial condition and results. Despite careful tracking and planning, however, we are unable to accurately predict the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business, results of operations and financial condition due to the uncertainty of future developments. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19, the actions taken to contain it or treat its impact and the economic impact on local, regional, national and international markets. For additional information on the various risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. - 73 - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities for the periods presented. Some of these judgments can be subjective and complex, and, consequently, actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe that the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon historical experience and information available to us at the time that we make these estimates and judgments. To the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our consolidated financial statements will be affected. Although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate, actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: Inventory Valuation Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. We capitalize inventory costs associated with products following regulatory approval when future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized. EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53 and AMONDYS 45 inventory that may be used in clinical development programs is charged to research and development expense when the product enters the research and development process and no longer can be used for commercial purposes. We periodically analyze our inventories for excess amounts or obsolescence and write down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value based on assumptions about expected future demand and market conditions. Additionally, though our products are subject to strict quality control and monitoring, which we perform throughout the manufacturing processes, certain batches or units of product may not meet quality specifications. Expense incurred related to excess inventory, obsolete inventory, or inventories that do not meet our quality specifications are recorded as a component of cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations. Income Tax We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon an examination. The calculation of our tax liabilities resulting from uncertain tax positions can involve significant judgment. Further, the calculation may involve the application of complex tax regulations in a foreign jurisdiction. Any significant impact as a result of changes in underlying facts, law, tax rates, tax audit, or review could lead to adjustments to our income tax expense, our effective tax rate, and/or our cash flow. Although we believe that we have adequately provided for tax liabilities resulting from uncertain tax positions, the actual amounts paid, if any, could have a material impact on our results of operations. Interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions are classified as a component of income tax expense. Please read Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates. - 74 - The following table sets forth selected consolidated statements of operations data for each of the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 Change Change (in thousands, except per share amounts) $ % Revenues: Products, net $ 612,401 $ 455,865 $ 156,536 34 % Collaboration and other 89,486 84,234 5,252 6 % Total revenues 701,887 540,099 161,788 30 % Cost and expenses: Cost of sales (excluding amortization of in-licensed rights) 97,049 63,382 33,667 53 % Research and development 771,182 722,343 48,839 7 % Selling, general and administrative 282,660 317,875 (35,215 ) (11 )% Settlement and license charges 10,000 — 10,000 NM* Amortization of in-licensed rights 706 662 44 7 % Total cost and expenses 1,161,597 1,104,262 57,335 5 % Operating loss (459,710 ) (564,163 ) 104,453 (19 )% Other income: Gain from sale of Priority Review Voucher 102,000 108,069 (6,069 ) (6 )% Gain (loss) on contingent consideration, net 7,200 (45,000 ) 52,200 (116 )% Other expense, net (68,438 ) (51,971 ) (16,467 ) 32 % Total other income 40,762 11,098 29,664 NM* Loss before income tax (benefit) expense (418,948 ) (553,065 ) 134,117 (24 )% Income tax (benefit) expense (168 ) 1,063 (1,231 ) (116 )% Net loss $ (418,780 ) $ (554,128 ) $ 135,348 (24 )% Net loss per share — basic and diluted $ (5.15 ) $ (7.11 ) $ 1.96 (28 )% * NM: not meaningful Revenues The following table summarizes the components of our net product revenues for the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 Change Change (in thousands) $ % EXONDYS 51 $ 454,361 $ 422,007 $ 32,354 8 % VYONDYS 53 89,511 33,858 55,653 164 % AMONDYS 45 68,529 — 68,529 NM* Products, net $ 612,401 $ 455,865 $ 156,536 34 % Net product revenues for our products for 2021 increased by $156.5 million compared with 2020. The increase primarily reflects increasing demand for our products in the U.S. and the commercial launch of AMONDYS 45. Collaboration and other revenues primarily relate to our collaboration arrangement with Roche. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, we recognized $89.5 million and $84.2 million of collaboration and other revenues, respectively. For more information, please read Note 3, License and Collaboration Agreements . Cost of sales (excluding amortization of in-licensed rights) Our cost of sales (excluding amortization of in-licensed rights) consists of royalty payments primarily to BioMarin and UWA and inventory costs that relate to sales of our products. Prior to receiving regulatory approval for EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53 and AMONDYS 45 by the FDA in September 2016, December 2019 and February 2021, respectively, we expensed such manufacturing - 75 - and material costs as research and development expenses. For AMONDYS 45 sold in 2021 and VYONDYS 53 sold in 2020, the majority of related manufacturing costs incurred had previously been expensed as research and development expenses, as such costs were incurred prior to the FDA approval of the products. For VYONDYS sold in 2021 and EXONDYS 51 sold in 2021 and 2020, only part of the related manufacturing costs incurred had previously been expensed as research and development expenses. If product related costs had not previously been expensed as research and development expenses prior to FDA approval, the incremental inventory costs related to our products sold in 2021 and 2020 would have been approximately $22.0 million and $25.9 million, respectively. The following table summarizes the components of our cost of sales for the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 Change Change (in thousands) $ % Inventory costs related to products sold $ 56,720 $ 34,323 $ 22,397 65 % Royalty payments 40,329 29,059 11,270 39 % Total cost of sales $ 97,049 $ 63,382 $ 33,667 53 % The cost of sales for 2021 increased $33.7 million, or 53%, compared with 2020. The change primarily reflects increasing demand for our products. Research and development expenses Research and development expenses consist of costs associated with research activities as well as costs associated with our product development efforts, conducting pre-clinical trials, clinical trials and manufacturing activities. Direct research and development expenses associated with our programs include clinical trial site costs, clinical manufacturing costs, costs incurred for consultants, up-front fees and milestones paid to third parties in connection with technologies that have not reached technological feasibility and do not have an alternative future use, and other external services, such as data management and statistical analysis support, and materials and supplies used in support of clinical programs. Indirect costs of our clinical programs include salaries, stock-based compensation and allocation of our facility- and technology-related costs. Research and development expenses represent a substantial percentage of our total operating expenses. We do not maintain or evaluate and, therefore, do not allocate internal research and development costs on a project-by-project basis. As a result, a significant portion of our research and development expenses are not tracked on a project-by-project basis, as the costs may benefit multiple projects.

The increase was primarily driven by the following: Selling, general and administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and related costs for personnel in our executive, finance, legal, information technology, business development, human resources, commercial and other - 77 - general and administrative functions. Other general and administrative expenses include an allocation of our facility- and technology-related costs and professional fees for legal, consulting and accounting services. The following table summarizes our selling, general and administrative expenses by category for each of the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 Change Change (in thousands) $ % Compensation and other personnel expenses $ 103,528 $ 105,233 $ (1,705 ) (2 )% Professional services 73,605 106,571 (32,966 ) (31 )% Stock-based compensation 63,417 66,399 (2,982 ) (4 )% Facility- and technology-related expenses 31,113 28,615 2,498 9 % Other 11,251 11,661 (410 ) (4 )% Roche collaboration reimbursement (254 ) (604 ) 350 (58 )% Total selling, general and administrative expenses $ 282,660 $ 317,875 $ (35,215 ) (11 )% Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2021 decreased by $35.2 million, or 11%, compared with 2020. This was primarily driven by the following: Settlement and license charges In February 2021, we recognized a $10.0 million settlement charge related to contingent settlement payments to BioMarin as a result of the approval of AMONDYS 45 in the U.S. This was a result of a settlement and license agreement with BioMarin executed in July 2017. This amount, which was expensed to operations as incurred, is separately presented as settlement and license charges in the Company's consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2021. There was no such expense recognized during the same period of 2020. Amortization of in-licensed rights Amortization of in-licensed rights relates to the agreements we entered into with BioMarin and UWA in July 2017 and April 2013, respectively. Each in-licensed right is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the patent from the first commercial sale of each product. For both the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded amortization of in-licensed rights of approximately $0.7 million. Gain from sale of Priority Review Voucher I n February 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell the PRV (the ""AMONDYS 45 PRV"") we received from the FDA in connection with the approval of AMONDYS 45. Following the termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, in April 2021, we completed our sale of the AMONDYS 45 PRV and received proceeds of $102.0 million, with no commission costs, which was recorded as a gain from sale of the PRV as it did not have a carrying value at the time of the sale. In February 2020, we entered into an agreement to sell the PRV (the ""VYONDYS 53 PRV"") we received from the FDA in connection with the approval of VYONDYS 53. Following the early termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, in March 2020, we completed our sale of the VYONDYS 53 PRV and received proceeds of $108.1 million, net of commission, which was recorded as a gain from sale of the PRV as it did not have a carrying value at the time of the sale. Gain (loss) on contingent consideration, net The gain (loss) on contingent consideration, net, relates to the fair value adjustment of the Company’s contingent consideration derivative liability related to regulatory-related contingent payments to Myonexus selling shareholders as well as to two - 78 - academic institutions under separate license agreements that meet the definition of a derivative. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recognized a $7.2 million net gain and $45.0 million net loss, respectively, to adjust the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities. For further information on our contingent considerations, please read Note 5, Fair Value Measurements. Other expense, net Other expense, net, primarily consists of interest income on our cash, cash equivalents and investments, interest expense on our debt facilities, amortization of investment discount, and unrealized gain or loss from our investment in our strategic investments. Our cash equivalents and investments consist of money market funds, government and government agency debt securities, and certificates of deposit. Interest expense includes interest accrued on our convertible notes and term loan. Other expense, net, for 2021 increased by approximately $16.5 million compared with 2020. The increase primarily reflects an increase in interest expense incurred on our term loan debt facilities due to an increase in the outstanding balance as well as an impairment loss related to a strategic investment, partially offset by a decrease of $20.8 million in non-cash interest expense on our convertible debt in 2021 as compared to 2020. Income tax (benefit) expense Income tax benefit for 2021 was approximately $0.2 million and income tax expense for 2020 was $1.1 million. Income tax (benefit) expense for all periods presented relates to state and foreign income taxes. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes our financial condition for each of the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 Change Change (in thousands) $ % Financial assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,115,869 $ 1,502,648 $ 613,221 41 % Short-term investments — 435,923 (435,923 ) (100 )% Restricted cash and investments 9,904 9,315 589 6 % Total cash, cash equivalents and investments $ 2,125,773 $ 1,947,886 $ 177,887 9 % Borrowings: Term loan $ 533,203 $ 527,731 $ 5,472 1 % Convertible debt 563,673 464,762 98,911 21 % Total borrowings $ 1,096,876 $ 992,493 $ 104,383 11 % Working capital Current assets $ 2,604,099 $ 2,485,196 $ 118,903 5 % Current liabilities 452,733 416,026 36,707 9 % Total working capital $ 2,151,366 $ 2,069,170 $ 82,196 4 % For the year ended December 31, 2021, our principal sources of liquidity were primarily derived from sales of our products, our collaboration arrangement with Roche, net proceeds from sale of the PRV, and net proceeds from our common stock offering. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our principal sources of liquidity were primarily derived from our collaboration arrangement with Roche, net proceeds from draw-down of our debt facility, net proceeds from sale of the PRV and product sales of our products. Our principal uses of cash are research and development expenses, selling, general and administrative expenses, investments, capital expenditures, business development transactions and other working capital requirements. The changes in our total borrowings primarily reflect the adoption of ASU 2020-06 as of January 1, 2021, which resulted in the convertible debt being accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost. For more information on the adoption and impact of ASU 2020-06, please read Note 13, Indebtedness. The changes in our working capital primarily reflect use of cash in operating activities. While our contractual obligations, commitments and debt service requirements over the next several years are significant, we intend to continue to fund our short-term financing needs and working capital requirements from cash flows of operating activities as well as cash on hand, and such sources are anticipated to be adequate to fund working capital requirements for at least twelve months from the date these consolidated financial statements were issued. Beyond 2022, our cash requirements will depend extensively on our ability to advance our research, development and commercialization programs. We expect to seek additional financings primarily from, but not limited to, the sale and issuance of - 79 - equity and debt securities, the licensing or sale of our technologies, additional government contracts and/or funded research and development agreements. Our future expenditures and long-term capital requirements may be substantial and will depend on many factors, including but not limited to the following: We cannot provide assurances that financing will be available when and as needed or that, if available, the financings will be on favorable or acceptable terms. If we are unable to obtain additional financing when and if we require, this would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. To the extent we issue additional equity securities, our existing stockholders could experience substantial dilution. Cash Flows The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for each of the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 Change Change (in thousands) $ % Cash (used in) provided by Operating activities $ (443,172 ) $ 107,466 $ (550,638 ) NM* Investing activities 495,413 (121,721 ) 617,134 NM* Financing activities 561,569 682,323 (120,754 ) (18 )% Increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 613,810 $ 668,068 $ (54,258 ) (8 )% * NM: not meaningful Operating Activities Cash used in operating activities, which consists of our net loss adjusted for non-cash items and changes in net operating assets and liabilities, totaled $443.2 million in 2021. Operating activities provided $107.5 million of cash in 2020. The most significant contributor to the year-over-year change was the cash received in the prior year relating to the collaboration arrangement with Roche that was recorded as deferred revenue. Cash used in operating activities in 2021 was primarily driven by the net loss of $418.8 million, adjusted for following: These amounts were partially offset by the gain of $102.0 million recorded from the sale of the PRV. - 80 - The net cash outflow from changes in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by the following: These amounts were partially offset by the following: Cash provided by operating activities in 2020 was primarily driven by the net loss of $554.1 million, adjusted for: These amounts were partially offset by the gain of $108.1 million recorded from the sale of the PRV. The net cash inflow from changes in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by the following: These increases were partially offset by: Investing Activities Cash provided by investing activities was $495.4 million in 2021 compared to $121.7 million of cash used in 2020. Cash provided by investing activities in 2021 primarily consisted of the following: These amounts were partially offset by the following: Cash used in investing activities in 2020 primarily consisted of the following: These amounts were partially offset by the following: - 81 - Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities was $561.6 million in 2021 compared to $682.3 million in 2020. Cash provided by financing activities in 2021 consisted primarily of the following: These amounts were partially offset by $7.8 million of taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards. Cash provided by financing activities in 2020 primarily consisted of the following: These amounts were partially offset by $4.8 million of taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements During the periods presented, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or for another contractually narrow or limited purpose. As such, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by Regulation S-K of the Securities Act of 1933. Contractual Payment Obligations In our continuing operations, we have entered into long-term contractual arrangements from time to time for our facilities, the provision of goods and services, and issuance of debt securities, among others. As of December 31, 2021, total obligations under debt, lease, and manufacturing arrangements were $1.3 billion, $64.2 million, and $1.2 billion, respectively. Additional information regarding our obligations under debt, lease, and manufacturing arrangements is provided in Note 13, Indebtedness, Note 19, Leases and Note 21, Commitments and Contingencies , respectively, to the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Milestone Obligations For products and product candidates that are currently in various research and development stages, we may be obligated to make up to $4.0 billion of future development, regulatory, up-front royalty and sales milestone payments associated with our collaboration and license agreements. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable upon achievement of certain development, regulatory or commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones is not probable and payment is not required as of December 31, 2021, such contingencies have not been recorded in our consolidated financial statements. Amounts related to contingent milestone payments are not yet considered contractual obligations as they are contingent on the successful achievement of certain development, regulatory approval and commercial milestones. Other Funding Commitments We have several on-going clinical trials in various stages. Our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to CROs. The CRO contracts are generally cancellable at our option. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $378.5 million in cancellable future commitments based on existing CRO contracts. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Please read Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualita tive Disclosures About Market Risk. Our current investment policy is to maintain a diversified investment portfolio consisting of money market investments, commercial paper, government and government agency bonds and high-grade corporate bonds with maturities of 36 months or less. Our cash is deposited in and invested through highly rated financial institutions in the U.S. As of December 31, 2021, we had $2,125.8 - 82 - million of cash, cash equivalents and investments, comprised of $2,115.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and $9.9 million of restricted cash and investments. The Company did not hold any investments in interest rate sensitive instruments as of December 31, 2021. Item 8. Financial Statem ents and Supplementary Data. The information required by this Item 8 begins on page F-1 in Item 15 of Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is incorporated into this item by reference. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Acc ountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. None. Item 9A. Control s and Procedures. Disclosure Controls and Procedures We carried out an evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to paragraph (b) of Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Based on that review, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act (1) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and (2) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control procedure, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control procedure are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. We considered these limitations during the development of our disclosure controls and procedures, and will continually reevaluate them to ensure they provide reasonable assurance that such controls and procedures are effective. Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for our Company, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that: Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in its 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on this assessment, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2021, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. - 83 - The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have not been material changes in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a–15(f) and 15d–15(f) under the Exchange Act for the quarter ended December 31, 2021 that our certifying officers concluded materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for convertible debt as of January 1, 2021 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2020-06, Debt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity. Basis for Opinions The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in F- 2 accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Evaluation of lower of cost or net realizable value of raw materials inventory As described in Note 2 and Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, approximately 19%, or $58.8 million, of the Company’s total inventory balance is comprised of raw materials. As discussed in Note 2, the Company periodically analyzes its raw materials inventories, and writes down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value. We identified the evaluation of lower of cost or net realizable value of raw materials inventory as a critical audit matter. The estimate of expected future demand for raw materials inventory is difficult to assess and results in the application of greater auditor judgment. Specifically, challenging auditor judgment was required to assess the potential impact the Company’s gene therapy technologies and competitor RNA-targeted therapeutic or gene therapy products could have on existing raw materials inventory. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s inventory valuation process, including controls related to the estimate of expected future demand for raw materials. We compared the Company’s prior period forecasted demand for raw materials to actual results to assess their ability to accurately estimate expected future demand. We evaluated clinical progress associated with the Company’s gene therapy technologies by inspecting internal meeting minutes and interviewing research and development personnel of the Company and assessed the potential impact of those technologies on expected future demand for raw materials inventory. We also read publicly available information to identify information regarding other competitor entities with RNA-targeted therapeutic or gene therapy products that could impact the Company’s estimates of expected future demand. /s/ KPMG LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002.

F- 7 Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, “Sarepta” or the “Company”) is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on helping patients through the discovery and development of unique RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene therapy and other genetic therapeutic modalities for the treatment of rare diseases. Applying its proprietary, highly-differentiated and innovative technologies, and through collaborations with its strategic partners, the Company is developing potential therapeutic candidates for a broad range of diseases and disorders, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy (“Duchenne”), Limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (“LGMDs”) and other neuromuscular and central nervous system (“CNS”) disorders. The Company's products in the U.S., EXONDYS 51 (eteplirsen) Injection (“EXONDYS 51”), VYONDYS 53 (golodirsen) Injection (“VYONDYS 53”) and AMONDYS 45 (casimersen) Injection (“AMONDYS 45”), were granted accelerated approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) on September 19, 2016, December 12, 2019 and February 25, 2021, respectively. Indicated for the treatment of Duchenne in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the dystrophin gene that is amenable to exon 51, exon 53 and exon 45 skipping, respectively, EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53 and AMONDYS 45 use the Company’s phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (“PMO”) chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 51, exon 53 and exon 45 of the dystrophin gene. Exon skipping is intended to promote the production of an internally truncated but functional dystrophin protein. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately $ 2,125.8 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments, consisting of $ 2,115.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and $ 9.9 million of restricted cash and investments. The Company believes that its balance of cash, cash equivalents and investments as of December 31, 2021 is sufficient to fund its current operational plan for at least the next twelve months, though it may pursue additional cash resources through public or private debt and equity financings, seek funded research and development arrangements and additional government contracts and establish collaborations with or license its technology to other companies. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”), reflect the accounts of Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions between and among its consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated. Management has determined that the Company operates in one segment: discovering, developing, manufacturing and delivering therapies to patients with rare diseases. The Company’s CEO, as the chief operating decision-maker, manages and allocates resources to the operations of the Company on a total company basis. The Company’s research and development organization is responsible for the research and discovery of new product candidates and supports development and registration efforts for potential future products. The Company’s supply chain organization manages the development of the manufacturing processes, clinical trial supply and commercial product supply. The Company’s commercial organization is responsible for commercialization of EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53 and AMONDYS 45 in the U.S. and internationally. The Company is supported by other back-office general and administration functions. Consistent with this decision-making process, the Company’s CEO uses consolidated, single-segment financial information for purposes of evaluating performance, forecasting future period financial results, allocating resources and setting incentive targets. In the opinion of the Company’s management, all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair presentation have been reflected. Estimates and Uncertainties The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. F- 8 Fair Value Measurements The Company has certain financial assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value which have been classified as Level 1, 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy as described in the accounting standards for fair value measurements: The fair value of the majority of the Company’s financial assets is categorized as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. These assets include money market funds, and publicly traded debt and equity securities. For additional information related to fair value measurements, please read Note 5, Fair Value Measurements to the consolidated financial statements. Cash Equivalents Only investments that are highly liquid and readily convertible to cash and have original maturities of three months or less are considered cash equivalents. Investments Available-For-Sale Debt Securities Available-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholder’s equity. Interest income and realized gains and losses are reported in other expense, net, on a specific identification basis. Equity Investments The Company’s equity investments include its investments in a publicly traded biotechnology company and several privately held biotechnology companies and are included in other non-current assets in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The equity investment in the publicly traded biotechnology company has a readily determinable fair value and is carried at fair value. The equity investments in the privately held biotechnology companies do not have readily determinable fair values and are measured at cost less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Any change in the valuation of equity investments is recorded as a gain or loss on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Accounts Receivable The Company’s accounts receivable primarily arise from product sales. They are generally stated at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Revenues from product sales are recorded at the net sales price (transaction price), which includes estimates of variable consideration for which reserves are established and which result from Medicaid rebates, governmental chargebacks including Public Health Services (“PHS”) chargebacks, prompt pay discounts, co-pay assistance and distribution fees. These reserves are based on the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if no payments are required of the Company) for PHS chargebacks, prompt pay discounts and certain distribution fees, or a current liability (if a payment is required of the Company) for Medicaid rebates, co-pay assistance and certain distribution fees. The accounts receivable from product sales represents receivables due from the Company’s specialty distributor and specialty pharmacies in the U.S. as well as certain distributors in the European Union (“EU”) , Brazil, Israel and the Middle East. The Company has had no historical write-offs of its accounts receivable and its payment terms range from 60 to 91 days for sales within the U.S. and 45 and 150 days for the majority of product sales outside the U.S. The Company monitors the financial performance and creditworthiness of its customers so that it can properly assess and respond to changes in the customers’ credit profiles or any specific issues. The Company provides reserves against trade receivables for expected credit losses that may result from a customer’s inability to pay. Amounts determined to be uncollectible are written-off against the established reserve. As of December 31, 2021 , the credit profiles for the Company’s customers are deemed to be in good standing and an allowance for credit losses is not considered necessary. F- 9 Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of accounts receivable from customers and cash. Three individual customers accounted for 48 %, 39 % and 10 % o f net product revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 , 47 %, 39 % and 11 % for the year ended December 31, 2020 , and 43 %, 41 % and 13 % for the year ended December 31, 2019. Three individual customers accounted for 41 %, 41 % and 10 % of accounts receivable from product sales for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 45 %, 41 % and 9 % for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, the Company believes that such customers are of high credit quality. As of December 31, 2021, the Company’s cash was concentrated at three financial institutions, which potentially exposes the Company to credit risks. However, the Company does not believe that there is significant risk of non-performance by the financial institutions. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. The Company capitalizes inventory costs associated with products following regulatory approval when future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized. EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53 and AMONDYS 45 inventory used in clinical development programs is charged to research and development expense when the product enters the research and development process and no longer can be used for commercial purposes. The Company periodically analyzes its inventories for excess amounts or obsolescence and writes down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value. Additionally, though the Company’s products are subject to strict quality control and monitoring which the Company performs throughout the manufacturing processes, certain batches or units of product may not meet quality specifications. Expense incurred related to excess inventory, obsolete inventory, or inventories that do not meet the Company's quality specifications are recorded as a component of cost of sales in the Company's consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. For products which are under development and have not yet been approved by regulatory authorities, purchased drug product is charged to research and development expense upon delivery. Delivery occurs when the inventory passes quality inspection and ownership transfers to the Company. Nonrefundable advance payments for research and development activities, including production of purchased drug product, are deferred and capitalized until the goods are delivered. If the Company does not expect the goods to be delivered or services to be rendered, the advanced payment capitalized will be charged to expense. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are initially recorded at cost, including the acquisition cost and all costs necessarily incurred to bring the asset to the location and working condition necessary for their intended use. The cost of normal, recurring or periodic repairs and maintenance activities related to property and equipment are expensed as incurred. The cost for planned major maintenance activities, including the related acquisition or construction of assets, is capitalized if the repair will result in future economic benefits. Interest costs incurred during the construction period of major capital projects are periodically reviewed, and if determined to be material, capitalized until the asset is ready for its intended use, at which point the interest costs are amortized as depreciation expense over the life of the underlying asset. The Company generally depreciates the cost of its property and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which are summarized as follows: Asset Category Useful lives Lab and manufacturing equipment 5 years Office equipment 5 years Software and computer equipment 3 - 5 years Furniture and fixtures 7 years Leasehold improvements Lesser of the useful life or the term of the respective lease Land improvements 25 years Land Not depreciated Building and improvements 30 years Construction in progress Not depreciated until put into service F- 10 Intangible assets The Company’s intangible assets consist of in-licensed rights, patent costs and software licenses, which are stated in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, net of accumulated amortization and impairments, if applicable. The in-licensed rights primarily relate to agreements with BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. (“BioMarin”) and the University of Western Australia (“UWA”). The in-licensed rights are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the related patents because the life of the related patents reflects the expected time period that the Company will benefit from the in-licensed rights. Patent costs consist primarily of external legal costs, filing fees incurred to file patent applications and renewal fees on proprietary technology developed or licensed by the Company. Patent costs associated with applying for a patent, being issued a patent and annual renewal fees are capitalized. Costs to defend a patent and costs to invalidate a competitor’s patent or patent application are expensed as incurred. Patent costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated economic lives or the initial term of the patents, which is generally 20 years. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets held and used by the Company, intangible assets with definite lives and right of use (“ROU”) assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. The Company evaluates recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Such reviews assess the fair value of the assets based upon estimates of future cash flows that the assets are expected to generate. Convertible Debt As a result of adopting ASU 2020-06, “ Debt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity ”, the Company accounts for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments that can be settled in cash as a single liability measured at its amortized cost, as long as no other features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging (“ASC 815”). Simultaneously with the issuance of the 2024 Notes (defined below) in November 2017, the Company bought capped call options from certain counterparties to minimize the impact of potential dilution upon conversion. The premium for the capped call options was recorded as additional paid-in capital. For additional information related to the convertible debt transactions, please read Note 13, Indebtedness to the consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for the goods or services provided. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements within the scope of ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), the Company performs the following five steps: (1) identify the contract with the customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers or provides to the customer. At contract inception, the Company assesses the goods or services promised within each contract and determines those that are performance obligations, and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. The Company then recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when or as the performance obligation is satisfied. The only performance obligation in the Company’s contracts with customers is to timely deliver drug products to the customer’s designated location. Product revenues The Company distributes its products principally through its customers. The customers subsequently resell the products to patients and health care providers. The Company provides no right of return to the customers except in cases of shipping error or product defect. Product revenues are recognized when the customers take control of the products, which typically occurs upon delivery to the customers. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the majority of the product revenues recognized were generated by the specialty distributor and specialty pharmacies in the U.S. F- 11 Variable Consideration Product revenues are recorded at the net sales price (transaction price) which includes estimated reserves for variable consideration, such as Medicaid rebates, governmental chargebacks, including PHS chargebacks, prompt payment discounts, co-pay assistance and distribution fees. These reserves reflect the Company’s best estimates of the amount of consideration to which it is entitled based on the terms of the contracts. Additional details relating to variable consideration follows: Collaboration revenue The Company’s collaboration revenue is primarily generated from its collaboration arrangement with F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd. (“Roche”). For more information, please read Note 3, Collaboration and License Agreements . At the inception of a collaboration arrangement, the Company first assesses whether the contractual arrangement is within the scope of ASC Topic 808, Collaborative Arrangements (“ASC 808”) to determine whether the arrangement involves a joint operating activity and involves two (or more) parties that are both active participants in the activity and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of such activity. Then the Company determines whether the collaboration arrangement in its entirety represents a contract with a customer as defined by ASC 606. If only a portion of the collaboration arrangement is potentially with a customer, the Company applies the distinct good or service unit-of-account guidance in ASC 606 to determine whether there is a unit of account that should be accounted for under ASC 606. For the units of account in the collaboration arrangement that do not represent a vendor-customer relationship, the Company will (i) consider applying other GAAP, including by analogy, or (ii) if there is no appropriate analogy, consistently apply a reasonable and rational accounting policy election. In general, by analogy to ASC 606, the Company identifies the performance obligations within the collaboration arrangement and identifies and allocates the transaction price the Company expects to receive on a relative standalone selling price basis to each performance obligation. Variable consideration, consisting of development and regulatory milestones, will be included in the transaction price only if the Company expects to receive such consideration and if it is probable that the inclusion of the variable consideration will not result in a significant reversal in the cumulative amount of revenue recognized under the arrangement. Sales-based royalty and milestone payments are excluded from the transaction price the Company expects to receive until the underlying sales occur because the license to the Company’s intellectual property is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties or milestones relate as it is the primary driver of value in its collaboration arrangement. F- 12 For the recognition of revenue associated with each performance obligation, if the Company determines ASC 606 is not appropriate to apply by analogy, the Company will apply a reasonable, rational and consistently applied accounting policy election to faithfully depict the transfer of services to the collaboration partner over the estimated performance period. Up-front payments from a collaboration partner are recognized as deferred revenue when received and recognized as revenue over the estimated performance period. Reimbursement payments from a collaboration partner associated with cost sharing provisions in a collaboration arrangement are recognized as the related expense is incurred and classified as an offset to operating expenses. Valuation of Product Options The Company's collaboration arrangements may contain options which provide the collaboration partner with the right to obtain additional licenses. If an arrangement contains product options, by analogy to ASC 606, the Company evaluates the product options to determine whether they represent material rights, which may include options to acquire additional goods or services for free or at a discount. If the customer options are determined to represent material rights, they are recognized as a separate performance obligation at inception of the arrangement. The Company allocates a portion of the transaction price of the collaboration arrangement to material rights based on the relative standalone selling price. Amounts allocated to material rights are not recognized as revenue until related options are exercised or expire. Key assumptions to determine the standalone selling price of product options in a collaboration arrangement include, but are not limited to, forecasted revenues, development timelines, incremental costs related to the arrangement, discount rates and likelihood of technical and regulatory success. Research and Development Research and development expenses consist of costs associated with research activities as well as those with the Company’s product development efforts, conducting pre-clinical trials, clinical trials and manufacturing activities. Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred. Up-front fees and milestones paid to third parties in connection with technologies which have not reached technological feasibility and do not have an alternative future use are expensed when incurred. Direct research and development expenses associated with the Company’s programs include clinical trial site costs, clinical manufacturing costs, costs incurred for consultants and other external services, such as data management and statistical analysis support and materials and supplies used in support of clinical programs. Indirect costs of the Company’s clinical programs include salaries, stock-based compensation and an allocation of its facility and technology costs. When third-party service providers’ billing terms do not coincide with the Company’s period-end, the Company is required to make estimates of its obligations to those third parties, including clinical trial and pharmaceutical development costs, contractual services costs and costs for supply of its drug candidates, incurred in a given accounting period and record accruals at the end of the period. The Company bases its estimates on its knowledge of the research and development programs, services performed for the period, past history for related activities and the expected duration of the third-party service contract, where applicable. Stock-Based Compensatio n The Company’s stock-based compensation programs include stock options, restricted stock awards (“RSAs”), restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and an employee stock purchase program (“ESPP”). The Company accounts for stock-based compensation using the fair value method. The fair value of stock options are estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The fair values of RSAs and RSUs are based on the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant. The fair value of stock awards, with consideration given to estimated forfeitures, is recognized as stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the grants. For stock awards with performance-vesting conditions, the Company does not recognize compensation expense until it is probable that the performance-vesting condition will be achieved. Additionally, the Company granted its CEO options with service and market conditions. A market condition relates to the achievement of a specified price of the Company’s common stock, a specified amount of intrinsic value indexed to the Company’s common stock or a specified price of the Company’s common stock in terms of other similar equity shares. The grant date fair value for the options with service and market conditions is determined by a lattice model with Monte Carlo simulations and is recognized as stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period. Under the Company’s ESPP, participating employees purchase common stock through payroll deductions. The purchase price is equal to 85 % of the lower of the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the first business day and the last business day of the relevant purchase period. The fair value of stock purchase rights is estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The fair value of the look-back provision with the 15 % discount is recognized on a graded-vesting basis as stock-based compensation expense over the purchase period. F- 13 Income Taxes The Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the net deferred tax asset to zero when it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon an examination. The amount of the benefit that may be recognized in the financial statements is the largest amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions within income tax expense. It is the intention of the Company to reinvest the earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries in those operations and not to repatriate the earnings to the U.S. Accordingly, the Company does not provide for deferred taxes on the excess of the financial reporting over the tax basis in its investments in foreign subsidiaries as they are considered permanent in duration. Leases At the inception of an arrangement, the Company determines whether the arrangement is or contains a lease based on the unique facts and circumstances present in the arrangement. Leases with a term greater than 12 months are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and short-term and long-term lease liabilities, as applicable. The Company has elected not to recognize leases with terms of 12 months or less on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company typically only includes an initial lease term in its assessment of a lease arrangement. Options to renew a lease are not included in the Company’s assessment unless there is reasonable certainty that the Company will renew. The Company monitors its plans to renew its leases no less than on a quarterly basis. In addition, the Company’s lease agreements generally do not contain any residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants. Operating lease liabilities and their corresponding ROU assets are recorded based on the present value of future lease payments over the expected remaining lease term at lease commencement. The initial measurement of the lease liability is determined based on the future lease payments, which may include lease payments that depend on an index or a rate (such as the consumer price index or other market index). The Company initially measures payments based on an index or rate by using the applicable rate at lease commencement and subsequent changes in such rates are recognized as variable lease costs. Variable payments that do not depend on a rate or index are not included in the lease liability and are recognized as they are incurred. Lease cost for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as an operating expense with unrecognized variable lease payments recognized as incurred. Certain adjustments to the ROU asset may be required for items such as lease prepayments or incentives received. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable. As a result, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate, which reflects the fixed rate at which the Company could borrow on a collateralized basis the amount of the lease payments in the same currency, for a similar term, in a similar economic environment. Components of a lease are bifurcated between lease components and non-lease components. The fixed and in-substance fixed contract consideration identified is then allocated based on the relative standalone price to the lease and non-lease components. However, ASC Topic 842, Leases, provides entities with a practical expedient that allows an accounting policy election to not separate lease and non-lease components by class of underlying asset. In using this expedient, entities would account for each lease component and the related non-lease component together as a single component. For new and amended real estate leases beginning after January 1, 2019, the Company elected to account for the lease and non-lease components together for existing classes of underlying assets and allocates the contract consideration to the lease component only. In contrast, the Company does not apply the practical expedient for leases embedded in manufacturing and supply agreements with certain of its contract manufacturing organizations and has instead allocated contract consideration between the lease and non-lease components based on their relative standalone price. Embedded Derivatives The Company evaluates certain of its financial and business development transactions to determine if embedded components of these contracts meet the definition of derivative under ASC 815. In general, embedded derivatives are required to be bifurcated from the host instrument if (i) the embedded feature is not clearly and closely related to the host contract and (ii) the embedded feature, if considered a freestanding instrument, meets the definition of a derivative. The embedded derivative is reported on the consolidated balance sheets at its fair value. Any change in fair value, as determined at each measurement period, is recorded as a component of the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. F- 14 Contingent Consideration Certain of the Company’s license and collaboration agreements include future payments that are contingent upon the receipt, or receipt and subsequent sale, of a Priority Review Voucher (“PRV”) . The Company has concluded that these contingent payments represent embedded derivatives. The Company records a liability for such contingent payments at fair value on the date the agreements are effective. The Company estimates the fair value of contingent consideration derivatives through a valuation model that includes an income approach based on the probability-weighted expected cash flows that incorporated industry-based probability adjusted assumptions relating to the achievement of the milestone and thus the likelihood of making the payments. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration derivatives can result from changes to one or multiple assumptions, including adjustments to the discount rates, the assumed development timeline and the probability of achievement of certain regulatory milestones. The Company revalues its contingent consideration derivatives upon a material change to one or more of the assumptions discussed above. Changes in the fair value of the Company’s contingent consideration derivatives are recognized in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Such changes are classified as other income (loss) which corresponds to the classification of any gain recognized upon the actual sale of a PRV. Commitments and Contingencies The Company records liabilities for legal and other contingencies when information available to the Company indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Legal costs in connection with legal and other contingencies are expensed as costs are incurred. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Recently adopted In August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2020-06, “ Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity .” This ASU simplifies the complexity associated with applying U.S. GAAP for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity. More specifically, the amendments focus on the guidance for convertible instruments and derivative scope exceptions for contracts in an entity’s own equity. Under ASU 2020-06, the embedded conversion features are no longer separated from the host contract for convertible instruments with conversion features that are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under ASC 815, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital. Consequently, a convertible debt instrument, such as the Company’s senior notes due on November 15, 2024 (the “2024 Notes”), will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost, as long as no other features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives. The new guidance also requires the if-converted method to be applied for all convertible instruments and requires additional disclosures. This guidance is required to be adopted by January 1, 2022, and early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company elected to early adopt this guidance on January 1, 2021, using the modified retrospective method. Under this transition method, the cumulative effect of the accounting change removed the impact of recognizing the equity component of the Company’s convertible notes (at issuance and the subsequent accounting impact of additional interest expense from debt discount amortization). The cumulative effect of the accounting change as of January 1, 2021 increased the carrying amount of the convertible notes by $ 96.8 million, reduced accumulated deficit by $ 60.2 million and reduced additional paid-in capital by $ 157.0 million. Interest expense of the 2024 Notes will be lower as a result of adoption of this guidance. The if-converted method for such instruments will be used to compute diluted net earnings per share if and when profitability is achieved. As a result of the adoption of this guida nce, interest expense and net loss was reduced by $ 22.4 million, or $ 0.28 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2021. In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “ Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes”, which is intended to simplify the accounting for income taxes. This ASU removes certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and clarifies and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. The new guidance was effective beginning January 1, 2021. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 3. LICENSE AND COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd. On December 21, 2019, the Company entered into a license, collaboration and option agreement with Roche and a stock purchase agreement (the “Roche Agreement”) with Roche, providing Roche with exclusive commercial rights to SRP-9001, the Company’s investigational gene therapy for Duchenne, outside the U.S. The Company retains all rights to SRP-9001 in the U.S. and will perform all development activities within the joint global development plan necessary to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for SRP-9001 in the U.S. and the EU, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. Further: (i) research and development expenses incurred under the joint global development plan will be equally shared between the Company and Roche, (ii) Roche is solely responsible for all costs incurred in connection with any development activities (other than those within the joint global development plan) that are necessary to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals outside the U.S, and (iii) the Company will continue to be F- 15 responsible for the manufacturing of clinical and commercial supplies of SRP-9001. The Company has also granted Roche options to acquire ex-U.S. rights to certain future Duchenne-specific programs (the “Options”) in exchange for separate option exercise payments, milestone and royalty considerations, and cost sharing provisions. The agreement became effective on February 4, 2020. The Roche Agreement is governed by a joint steering committee (“JSC”) formed by representatives from Roche and the Company. The JSC, among other activities, manages the overall strategic alignment between the parties, approves any material update to the joint global development plan and budget and oversees the operations of the subcommittees. The Company received an aggregate of approximately $ 1.2 billion in cash consideration from Roche, consisting of an up-front payment and an equity investment in the Company. The Company may receive up to $ 1.7 billion in development, regulatory and sales milestones related to SRP-9001. Upon commercialization, the Company is also eligible to receive tiered royalty payments based on net sales. Of the $1.2 billion cash received from Roche, (i) $ 312.1 million, net of issuance costs, was allocated to the approximately 2.5 million shares of the Company’s common stock issued to Roche based on the closing price when the shares were issued, (ii) $ 485.0 million was allocated to the Options, and (iii) $ 348.7 million was allocated to a single, combined performance obligation (“Combined Performance Obligation”) comprised of: (i) the license of IP relating to SRP-9001 transferred to Roche, (ii) the related research and development services provided under the joint global development plan, (iii) the services provided to manufacture clinical supplies of SRP-9001, and (iv) the Company’s participation in the JSC, because the Company determined that the license of IP and related activities were not capable of being distinct from one another. The value assigned to the Options is reflected as deferred revenue and will not be recognized until an option is either: (i) exercised by Roche, or (ii) expires. If exercised, the value will be aggregated with the option exercise price and recognized over the applicable performance period. If expired, the value will be recognized immediately. The Company recognizes revenue related to the Combined Performance Obligation on a straight-line basis over the expected performance period of the joint global development plan, which is expected to extend through the fourth quarter of 2023. Revenue relating to future development, regulatory and sales milestones will be recognized when the milestone is probable of achievement (which is typically when the milestone has occurred). Any royalties payable by Roche in the future will be recognized in the period earned. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized $ 89.5 million and $ 84.2 million of collaboration and other revenues, respectively, the majority of which relates to the Combined Performance Obligation. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has total deferred revenue of $ 663.5 million associated with the Roche Agreement, of which $ 89.2 million is classified as current. Through 2021, no Options were exercised or expired. As such, deferred revenue related to the separate material rights for the Options remained unchanged at $ 485.0 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. The costs associated with co-development activities performed under the Roche Agreement are included in operating expenses, with any reimbursement of costs by Roche reflected as a reduction of such expenses when the related expense is incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, costs reimbursable by Roche and reflected as a reduction to operating expenses were $ 90.5 million and $ 66.5 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, there was $ 18.6 million of collaboration receivable included in other current assets. Genethon The Company entered into a sponsored research agreement in May 2017 and subsequently entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Genethon in November 2019 (the “Genethon Collaboration Agreement”) for Genethon’s micro-dystrophin gene therapy program for the treatment of Duchenne. The Genethon Collaboration Agreement grants the Company with exclusive rights in the majority of the world (primarily excluding the EU) to Genethon’s micro-dystrophin gene therapy products (“Genethon Products”) and other micro-dystrophin gene therapy products (“Other Licensed Products”). The Company may be liable for up to $ 157.5 million and $ 78.8 million in development, regulatory and sales milestones for the Genethon Products and Other Licensed Products, respectively. Furthermore, upon commercialization, the Company will be required to make tiered royalty payments based on net sales of the Genethon Products and the Other Licensed Products. Under the Genethon Collaboration Agreement, a joint steering committee was established to plan, monitor and coordinate development activities for Genethon Products and Other Licensed Products. The Company and Genethon are responsible for 75 % and 25 %, respectively, of development costs related to both the Genethon Products and the Other Licensed Products. Upon signing the Genethon Collaboration Agreement, the Company made an up-front payment of $ 28.0 million, which was recorded as research and development expense in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2019. Additionally, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company record ed $ 11.7 million, $ 10.1 million and $ 9.0 million, respectively, of research and development expense related to reimbursable development costs incurred by Genethon for Genethon Products. For the year ended December 31, 2021 , the Company recorded $ 4.0 million of research and development expense related to milestone achievements. No additional development or regulatory milestones were deemed probable of being achieved and, accordingly, no additional expense has been recognized. F- 16 StrideBio, Inc. In November 2019, the Company entered into a collaboration and license agreement and a stock purchase agreement (collectively, the “StrideBio Agreements”) with StrideBio, Inc. (“StrideBio”). The StrideBio Agreements grant the Company exclusive worldwide licenses to develop, collaborate and commercialize StrideBio’s adeno-associated viral capsids for gene therapy with respect to multiple development targets, to which the Company will have the exclusive right to perform development activities (“Sarepta Development Targets”) and targets that the two parties will jointly develop through completion of Phase 1/2 clinical trials (“Joint Development Targets”). For Sarepta Development Targets and Joint Development Targets, respectively, the Company may be liable for up to $ 450.0 million and $ 835.0 million in development, regulatory and sales milestone payments per target. Additionally, upon commercialization, the Company may be required to make tiered royalty payments based on net sales of each target. Upon signing the StrideBio Agreements, the Company made an up-front payment of $ 46.9 million, consisting of a cash payment of $ 17.5 million and 301,980 shares of the Company’s common stock delivered to StrideBio with a fair value of $ 29.4 million. The up-front payment was recorded as research and development expense in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2021, no develop ment or regulatory milestones were deemed probable of being achieved and, accordingly, no additional expense has been recognized. In March 2021, the Company participated in StrideBio’s Series B round of financing and purchased approximately 0.2 million shares of preferred stock. As of December 31, 2021, the equity investment in StrideBio’s Series B preferred stock was approximately $ 1.8 million. Please read Note 5, Fair Value Measurements for further information. Myonexus Therapeutics In April 2019, the Company completed its acquisition of Myonexus Therapeutics, Inc. (“Myonexus”), a clinical-stage gene therapy biotechnology company that was developing gene therapies for LGMD for $ 178.3 million. The Company may also be required to make up to $ 200.0 million in additional payments to selling shareholders of Myonexus based on the achievement of certain sales-and regulatory- related milestones. The acquisition was accounted for as an asset acquisition as substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a group of similar identifiable assets (the five LGMD gene therapy programs). The Company determined that one regulatory-related milestone (not solely based on drug approval by the FDA) met the definition of a derivative and recorded a contingent consideration liability. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the contingent consideration liability was $ 42.0 million and $ 49.5 million, respectively. The changes in fair value are recorded as other expense in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Please read Note 5, Fair Value Measurements for further information on the change in fair value of the contingent consideration liability. Lysogene S.A. In October 2018, the Company entered into a license and collaboration agreement to develop and commercialize LYS-SAF302, a gene therapy to treat Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA (“MPS IIIA”) as well as an equity investment agreement with Lysogene S.A. (“Lysogene”). Under the license and collaboration agreement, in addition to the payment of up-front fees, the Company may be liable for a total of $ 102.8 million in development, regulatory and sales milestones. Furthermore, the Company may be required to make tiered royalty payments based on net sales of the LYS-SAF302 product subsequent to its commercialization. Beginning January 1, 2020, the Company began to reimburse Lysogene for expenses incurred in connection with development activities of the MPS IIIA product candidate. As of December 31, 2021, the Company owns 1,140,728 shares of common stock issued by Lysogene and recorded $ 2.5 million of equity investment in Lysogene as an other non-current asset in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The Company sent a termination notice to Lysogene on January 11, 2022 to notify them of the Company's intent to terminate the license and collaboration agreement. The termination will become effective July 11, 2022. The Company does not have to pay any early termination penalties to Lysogene but is liable for certain research and development reimbursements incurred in the six months following termination, which are not expected to be material. As of December 31, 2021, there was no accounting impact as a result of the termination of the license and collaboration agreement because the notice of termination did not occur until subsequent to year-end. Lacerta Therapeutics In August 2018, the Company entered into a license, development and option agreement (the “Lacerta License Agreement”) and a Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”) with Lacerta Therapeutics, Inc. (“Lacerta”). Pursuant to the Lacerta License Agreement, the Company licensed exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize a pre-clinical Pompe product candidate (the “Pompe License”). Lacerta also granted the Company exclusive options to enter into exclusive license agreements to develop, manufacture and commercialize other gene therapy product candidates for F- 17 Sanfilipo syndrome and L-Amino Acid Decarboxylase Deficiency for additional consideration of $ 42.0 million (collectively, the “Options”) when (and if) the Options are exercised. Additionally, the Company may be liable for up to approximately $ 44.0 million in development, regulatory and sales milestones associated with the Pompe License and may be required to make tiered royalty payments based on net sales of the Pompe product subsequent to its commercialization. Under the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company purchased approximately 4.5 million shares of Series A preferred stock issued by Lacerta. Under the agreements, the Company made an up-front payment of $ 38.0 million to Lacerta, of which $ 30.0 million was allocated to the Series A preferred stock investment and recorded as an other non-current asset in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the carrying value of the investment are reported as a component of earnings whenever there are triggering events that warrant impairment or observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of Lacerta in the future. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company did no t record any changes in carrying value of the investment as Lacerta did not issue identical or similar shares during the corresponding periods. As of December 31, 2021, no development or regulatory milestones were deemed probable of being achieved and, accordingly, no additional expense has been recognized. Nationwide Children’s Hospital In December 2016, the Company entered into an exclusive option agreement with Nationwide Children’s Hospital (“Nationwide”) from which the Company obtained an exclusive right to acquire a worldwide license of the micro-dystrophin gene therapy technology for Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy. In October 2018, the Company exercised the option and entered into a license agreement with Nationwide, which granted the Company exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize a micro-dystrophin gene therapy product candidate. In July 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with Nationwide to settle a dispute relating to a sublicense payment owed by the Company resulting from the up-front payment received from Roche under the Roche Agreement. The total sublicense payment payable to Nationwide under the agreement is $ 38.0 million, which was paid in July 2021. Approximately $ 9.3 million of this amount was previously expensed during the year ended December 31, 2020 with the rema ining $ 28.7 million expensed during the year ended December 31, 2021. The expense relating to this payment is recognized to research and development expense. As a result of this payment, the Company has no further financial obligations to Nationwide resulting from the up-front payment received under the Roche Agreement. As of December 31, 2021, no development or regulatory milestones were deemed probable of being achieved and, accordingly, no additional in-licensed rights or expenses have been recognized. BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. In July 2017, the Company and UWA entered into a settlement agreement with BioMarin. On the same day, the Company entered into a license agreement, which was subsequently amended in April 2019, with BioMarin and Academisch Ziekenhuis Leiden (“AZL”) (collectively with the Company, UWA and BioMarin, the “Settlement Parties”). Under these agreements and amendment, BioMarin agreed to provide the Company with an exclusive license to certain intellectual property with an option to convert the exclusive license into a co-exclusive license and the Settlement Parties agreed to stop most existing efforts to continue with ongoing litigation and opposition and other administrative proceedings concerning BioMarin’s intellectual property. BioMarin is also eligible to receive tiered royalty payments, ranging from 4 % to 8 %, based on the net sales for the three products and product candidates. In November 2021, the Company entered into a second settlement agreement and second amendment to the license agreement (the “Second Amendment”), which waived certain future milestone payments and altered royalty payment terms of the agreement. Under the Second Amendment, the Company may be liable for up to approximately $ 50.0 million in regulatory milestones for eteplirsen, casimersen and golodirsen. In addition, on and after July 1, 2022, the tiered royalty payments will range from 4 % to 5 %. The royalty terms under the license agreement will expire in March 2024 in the U.S., December 2024 in the EU and no later than December 2024 in other countries. As a result of execution of the license agreement with BioMarin, the Company recorded an in-licensed right intangible asset of $ 6.6 million in its consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2017, representing the fair value of the U.S. license to BioMarin’s intellectual property. The intangible asset is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the patent and has a carrying value of $ 3.2 million as of December 31, 2021. The FDA approval of AMONDYS 45 and VYONDYS 53 in February 2021 and December 2019, respectively, resulted in settlement charges to BioMarin of $ 10.0 million during each period and each were expensed as incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized royalty expense of $ 31.4 million, $ 23.2 million and $ 19.4 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, no other regulatory milestones were deemed probable of being achieved and, accordingly, no additional in-licensed rights or expenses have been recognized. University of Western Australia In April 2013, the Company and UWA entered into an amendment to an existing exclusive license agreement relating to the treatment of Duchenne by inducing the skipping of certain exons. The agreement was further amended in June 2016. Under the amended agreement, the Company may be obligated to make payments to UWA totaling up to $ 26.0 million upon the achievement of F- 18 certain development, regulatory and sales milestones. Additionally, the Company is required to pay a low-single-digit percentage royalty on net sales of products covered by issued patents licensed under the agreements with UWA. Corresponding to the FDA approval of EXONDYS 51 in 2016, VYONDYS 53 in December 2019, and AMONDYS 45 in February 2021, the Company recorded milestone payments of $ 1.0 million, $ 0.5 million and $ 0.5 million as in-licensed right intangible assets in its consolidated balance sheets, respectively. Each in-licensed right is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the relevant patents and have a combined carrying value of $ 1.2 million as of December 31, 2021. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded $ 7.7 million, $ 5.7 million and $ 3.5 million in royalty expense, respectively, which is included in cost of sales, related to agreements with UWA. As of December 31, 2021 , no other development, regulatory or sales milestones were deemed probable of being achieved and, accordingly, no additional in-licensed rights or expenses have been recognized. Research and Option Agreements The Company has research and option agreements with third parties in order to develop various technologies and biologics that may be used in the administration of the Company’s genetic therapeutics. The agreements generally provide for research services related to pre-clinical development programs, and options to license the technology for clinical development. Prior to the options under these agreements being executed, the Company may be required to make up to $ 11.0 million in resea rch milestone payments. Under these agreements, there are $ 187.0 million in potential option payments to be made by the Company upon the determination to exercise the options. Additionally, if the options for each agreement are executed, the Company would incur additional contingent obligations and may be required to make development, regulatory, and sales milestone payments and tiered royalty payments based on the sales of the developed products upon commercialization. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recogn ized $ 3.0 million of research milestone expense s, with no similar activity for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. A s of December 31, 2021, the Company has not exercised any options nor have any additional research milestone payments become probable of occurring. Milestone Obligations Including the agreements discussed above, the Company has license and collaboration agreements in place for which it could be obligated to pay, in addition to the payment of up-front fees upon execution of the agreements, certain milestone payments as a product candidate proceeds from the submission of an investigational new drug application through approval for commercial sale and beyond. As of December 31, 2021, the Company may be obligated to make up to $ 4.0 billion of future development, regulatory, commercial, and up-front royalty payments associated with its collaboration and license agreements. These obligations exclude potential future option and milestone payments for options that have yet to be exercised within agreements entered into by the Company as of December 31, 2021, which are discussed above. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized approximately $ 50.3 million, $ 47.3 million, $ 113.2 million relating to certain up-front, milestone, settlement and other payments as research and development expense, respectively, under these agreements. The Company is also obligated to pay royalties on net sales of certain of its products related to these collaboration and license agreements. The royalty rates range from the low-single-digit to high teens percentages for both inside and outside the U.S. 4. GAIN FROM SALE OF PRIORITY REVIEW VOUCHER I n February 2021, the Company entered into an agreement to sell the rare pediatric disease PRV (the “ AMONDYS 45 PRV ” ) it received from the FDA in connection with the approval of AMONDYS 45. Following the termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, in April 2021, the Company completed its sale of the AMONDYS 45 PRV and received proceeds of $ 102.0 million, with no commission costs, which was recorded as a gain from sale of the PRV as it did not have a carrying value at the time of the sale. In February 2020, the Company entered into an agreement to sell the rare pediatric disease PRV (the “VYONDYS 53 PRV ” ) it received from the FDA in connection with the approval of VYONDYS 53. Following the early termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, in March 2020, the Company completed its sale of the VYONDYS 53 PRV and received proceeds of $ 108.1 million, net of commission, which was recorded as a gain from sale of the PRV as it did not have a carrying value at the time of the sale. F- 19 5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS There were no transfers between Levels 1, 2 and 3 during the year ended December 31, 2021 . The tables below present information about the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that are measured and carried at fair value and indicate the level within the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques it utilizes to determine such fair value: Fair Value Measurement as of December 31, 2021 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 (in thousands) Assets Money market funds $ 1,562,358 $ 1,562,358 $ — $ — Strategic equity investments 34,892 2,480 — 32,412 Certificates of deposit 250 250 — — Total assets $ 1,597,500 $ 1,565,088 $ — $ 32,412 Liabilities Contingent consideration $ 43,600 $ — $ — $ 43,600 Total liabilities $ 43,600 $ — $ — $ 43,600 Fair Value Measurement as of December 31, 2020 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 (in thousands) Assets Money market funds $ 629,440 $ 629,440 $ — $ — Government and government agency bonds 1,037,981 1,037,981 — — Strategic equity investments 38,799 3,699 — 35,100 Certificates of deposit 250 250 — — Total assets $ 1,706,470 $ 1,671,370 $ — $ 35,100 Liabilities Contingent consideration $ 50,800 $ — $ — $ 50,800 Total liabilities $ 50,800 $ — $ — $ 50,800 The Company’s assets with fair value categorized as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy include money market funds, certificates of deposit and the Company’s strategic investment in Lysogene, a publicly traded company in France, as more fully described in Note 3, License and Collaboration Agreements . The Company did not hold any government and government agency bonds as of December 31, 2021. Certain of the government and government agency bonds are publicly traded fixed income securities and were presented as cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020. The Company’s assets with fair value categorized as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy consists of a strategic investment in Series A preferred stock of Lacerta as more fully described in Note 3, License and Collaboration Agreements and strategic investments in another two private companies. At the end of each reporting period, the fair value of the Company's strategic investments will be adjusted if the issuers were to issue similar or identical equity securities or when there is a triggering event for impairment. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $ 4.5 million related to its investment in one of the private companies. The following table represents a roll-forward of the fair value of Level 3 financial assets for each of the periods indicated: As of December 31, 2021 2020 (in thousands) Fair value, beginning of year $ 35,100 $ 30,000 Additions 1,800 5,100 Changes in estimated fair value ( 4,488 ) — Fair value, end of year $ 32,412 $ 35,100 F- 20 The Company’s contingent consideration liability with fair value categorized as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy relates to the regulatory-related contingent payments to Myonexus selling shareholders as well as to two academic institutions under separate license agreements that meet the definition of a derivative. For more information related to Myonexus, please read Note 3, License and Collaboration Agreements . The contingent consideration liability was estimated using an income approach based on the probability-weighted expected cash flows that incorporated industry-based probability adjusted assumptions relating to the achievement of the milestone and thus the likelihood of making the payments. This fair value measurement was based upon significant inputs not observable in the market and therefore represented a Level 3 measurement. Significant changes which increase or decrease the probabilities of achieving the milestone or shorten or lengthen the time required to achieve the milestone would result in a corresponding increase or decrease in the fair value of the liability. At the end of each reporting period, the fair value is adjusted to reflect the most current assumptions through earnings. The following table represents a roll-forward of the fair value of Level 3 financial liabilities for each of the periods indicated: As of December 31, 2021 2020 (in thousands) Fair value, beginning of year $ 50,800 $ 5,200 Additions — 600 Changes in estimated fair value, net ( 7,200 ) 45,000 Fair value, end of year $ 43,600 $ 50,800 A net decrease of $ 7.2 million and net increase of $ 45.0 million was recorded during the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, to account for the change in fair value of existing contingent consideration liabilities. These changes, which are recorded through earnings, were a result of updates made to certain inputs and assumptions impacting the probability-weighted expected cash flows, principally the probability of success of the underlying programs, the estimate of the year that the payments are expected to be made, the expected approval date of the underlying programs and the estimate of the amount of payments to be ultimately made. An increase of $ 0.6 million was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020 to account for new contingent consideration liabilities associated with new license agreements with certain academic institutions that meet the definition of a derivative. As of December 31, 2021, the contingent consideration was recorded as a non-current liability on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments.

INDEBTEDNESS 2024 Convertible Notes On November 14, 2017, the Company issued $ 570.0 million senior notes due on November 15, 2024 . The 2024 Notes were issued at face value and bear interest at the rate of 1.50 % per annum, payable semi-annually in cash on each May 15 and November 15, commencing on May 15, 2018. The 2024 Notes contain customary covenants and events of default, occurrence of which permits the certain holders to accelerate all outstanding obligations, including principal and interest. The Company incurred $ 10.6 million of offering costs, which represents the total debt discount on the 2024 Notes at issuance. The debt discount is amortized under the effective interest method and recorded as additional interest expense over the life of the 2024 Notes. Upon conversion, the Company may pay cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and stock, as determined by the Company in its discretion. The 2024 Notes may be convertible into 7,763,552 shares of the Company’s common stock under certain circumstances prior to maturity at a conversion rate of 13.621 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the 2024 Notes, which represents a conversion price of $ 73.42 per share, subject to adjustment under certain conditions. To minimize the impact of potential dilution upon conversion of the 2024 Notes, the Company separately entered into capped call transactions with certain counterparties. The capped calls have a strike price of $ 73.42 and a cap price of $ 104.88 and are exercisable when and if the 2024 Notes are converted. If, upon conversion of the 2024 Notes, the price of the Company’s common stock is between the strike price and the cap price of the capped calls, the counterparties will deliver shares of the Company’s common stock and/or cash with an aggregate value equal to the difference between the price of the Company’s common stock at the conversion date and the strike price, multiplied by the number of shares of the Company’s common stock related to the capped calls being exercised. The Company paid $ 50.9 million for these capped calls transactions, which was recorded as additional paid-in capital. Upon adoption of ASU 2020-06, the 2024 Notes are accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost. The cumulative effect of the accounting change as of January 1, 2021 increased the carrying amount of the convertible notes by $ 96.8 million, reduced the accumulated deficit by $ 60.2 million and reduced additional paid-in capital by $ 157.0 million. Upon adoption of ASU 2020-06, the effective interest rate on the liability component of the 2024 Notes for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 1.9 %. The effective interest rate on the liability component of the 2024 Notes for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 6.9 %. Interest expense of the 2024 Notes was reduced by $ 22.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 as a result of adoption of this guidance. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the interest expense related to the 2024 Notes was $ 10.7 million, $ 31.4 million and $ 29.9 million, respectively. December 2019 Term Loan On December 13, 2019, the Company entered into a loan agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) which provides a term loan (“December 2019 Term Loan”) of $ 500.0 million with Biopharma Credit PLC and Biopharma Credit Investments V (Master) LP (collectively, the “Lenders”). The December 2019 Term Loan has two tranches: A and B, each of which had an initial loan amount of $ 250.0 million. On September 24, 2020, the Company entered into a first amendment to Credit Agreement (the “Amendment”),which increased the aggregate principal amount of tranche B of the December 2019 Term Loan from $250.0 million to $ 300.0 million and revised certain fees. Tranche A and B of the December 2019 Term Loan were drawn down on December 20, 2019 and November 2, 2020 and will mature on December 20, 2023 and December 31, 2024 , respectively, when the principal amount of the loan will become F- 26 due. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to 8.5 %, which shall be payable quarterly in arrears. The Company may voluntarily prepay, in whole or in part, the outstanding balance under the December 2019 Term Loan at any time after the tranche A closed but may be obligated to make additional financial considerations to the Lenders. Upon draw-down of tranche A and B, the Company received net proceeds of $ 244.9 million and $ 291.1 million, net of debt discounts of $ 9.4 million and $ 14.9 million relating to fees payable to the Lenders, respectively. Of the fees payable to the Lenders related to tranche A and B, $ 5.0 million and $ 6.0 million are expected to be paid on December 20, 2023 and December 31, 2024, respectively. The debt discounts are being treated as a reduction to the carrying value of tranche A and B of the December 2019 Term Loan and amortized as interest expense over the term of the loan based on an effective interest method. Debt issuance costs associated with the draw-down of tranche A and B were $ 0.7 million and less than $ 0.1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, the Company recorded approximately $ 1,096.9 million as long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheets.

The expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 3 years. Of this amount, $ 92.4 million relates to options with service conditions only, $ 4.3 million relates to awards with service and market conditions, and the remaining $ 79.0 million related to restricted stock units with service conditions only. 16. 401 (K) PLAN The Company sponsors a 401(k) Plan (“the Plan”) in the U.S. and other retirement plans in the rest of the world, all of which are defined contribution plans. The Plan is available to all employees who are age 21 or older. Participants may make voluntary contributions and the Company makes matching contributions according to the Plan’s matching formula. Matching contributions fully vest after one year of service for all employees. The expense related to the Plan primarily consists of the Company’s matching contributions. Expense related to the Plan totaled $ 5.3 million , $ 5.3 million and $ 3.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 , respectively. 17.

In February 2019, the Company exercised its option to acquire Myonexus. Accumulated costs of $ 253.7 million, associated with the Myonexus acquisition, were expensed for U.S. GAAP purposes. Of the $ 253.7 million in accumulated costs, $ 85.0 million relates to up-front and milestone payments as a result of the execution of the Warrant Agreement in May 2018 as well as certain development milestones being achieved or becoming probable of being achieved and $ 168.7 million relates to the exercise of the exclusive option to acquire Myonexus in February 2019. For U.S. income tax purposes, these costs are considered to be an investment in the subsidiary and are not currently deductible for tax purposes. The permanent difference related to this acquisition is separately stated in the rate reconciliation above. F- 32 The following table summarizes the analysis of the deferred tax assets and liabilities for each of the periods indicated: As of December 31, 2021 2020 (in thousands) Deferred tax assets: Net operating loss carryforwards $ 330,392 $ 333,703 Difference in depreciation and amortization 31,563 31,259 Research and development tax credits 201,512 159,917 Stock-based compensation 38,132 31,212 Lease liabilities 10,890 13,120 Capitalized inventory 24,172 35,959 Debt discount 5,875 — Other 38,315 28,381 Total deferred tax assets 680,851 633,551 Deferred tax liabilities: Right of use asset ( 7,405 ) ( 8,772 ) Debt discount — ( 18,044 ) Total deferred tax liabilities ( 7,405 ) ( 26,816 ) Valuation allowance ( 672,319 ) ( 605,848 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 1,127 $ 887 The Company has evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of its U.S. net deferred tax assets, which are comprised principally of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, research and development tax credit carryforwards, stock-based compensation expense, capitalized inventory, and intangibles. Under the applicable accounting standards, management has considered the Company’s history of losses and concluded that it is more likely than not that the Company will not recognize the benefits of net federal and state deferred tax assets. Accordingly, a full valuation allowance of the U.S. net deferred tax asset is maintained at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The net change in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was an increase of $ 66.5 million and $ 117.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. This increase for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to the generation of federal and state income tax credits and a decrease in the debt discount deferred tax liability that was recorded through additional paid-in capital as a result of the Company's early adoption of ASU 2020-06. The Company generated foreign deferred tax assets mainly consisting of net operating loss carryforwards, stock-based compensation and unrealized gain/losses. Based upon the income projections in the majority of the foreign jurisdictions, the Company believes it will realize the benefit of its future deductible differences in these jurisdictions. As such, the Company has not recorded a valuation allowance against these foreign jurisdictions. Brazil, the Netherlands, Czech Republic and one of the entities in the United Kingdom have generated deferred tax assets, which consist of net operating loss carryforwards and stock-based compensation expense. The Company has concluded that it is more likely than not that we will not recognize the future benefits of the deferred tax assets, and accordingly, a full valuation allowance has been recorded against these foreign deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2 021, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $ 1,280.4 million and $ 841.2 million, respectively, available to reduce future taxable income. The federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of $ 577.2 million and $ 797.0 million will expire at various dates between 2022 and 2041 . The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $ 703.2 million and $ 44.2 million, respectively, can be carried forward indefinitely. Utilization of these net operating losses could be limited under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and similar state laws based on historical or future ownership changes and the value of the Company’s stock. Additionally, the Company has $ 139.2 million and $ 77.0 million of federal and state research and development credits, respectively, available to offset future taxable income. These federal and state research and development credits begin to expire between 2022 and 2041 and between 2022 and 2036, respectively. The Company also has foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 13.6 million, mainly derived from the net operating loss generated by its subsidiary in Brazil, which may be carried forward indefinitely. The Company, or one of its subsidiaries, files income tax returns in the U.S., and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The federal, state and foreign income tax returns are generally subject to tax examinations for the tax years ended December 31, 2018 through December 31, 2021. To the extent the Company has tax attribute carryforwards, the tax years in which the attribute was generated may still be adjusted upon examination by the Internal Revenue Service, state or foreign tax authorities to the extent utilized in a future period. F- 33 The follow table summarizes the reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of total unrecognized tax benefits for each of the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 (in thousands) Balance at beginning of the period $ 48,475 $ 41,753 $ 37,544 Increase related to current year tax positions 5,503 6,722 4,275 Increase related to prior year tax positions — — 109 Decrease related to prior year tax positions ( 163 ) — ( 175 ) Balance at end of the period $ 53,815 $ 48,475 $ 41,753 The balance of total unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2021, if recognized, would not affect the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations, due to a full valuation allowance against the Company’s U.S. deferred tax assets. The Company does not expect that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly in the next twelve months. The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. It had no accrual for interest or penalties on its consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2021 or 2020. No interest and/or penalties were recognized in 2021 or 2020. The Company’s intent is to only make distributions from non-U.S. subsidiaries in the future when they can be made at no net tax cost. Otherwise, the Company considers all of its foreign earnings to be permanently reinvested outside of the U.S. and has no plans to repatriate these foreign earnings to the U.S. The Company has no material unremitted earnings from its non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act created a new provision that certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries, known as global intangible low-tax income, must be included in the gross income of their U.S. shareholder. The Company has adopted a policy to account for this provision as a period cost. 19. LEASES The Company has real estate operating leases in Cambridge, Andover and Burlington, Massachusetts, Dublin and Columbus, Ohio, and Durham, NC that provide for scheduled annual rent increases throughout each lease’s term. The Company has also identified leases embedded in certain of its manufacturing and supply agreements as the Company determined that it controls the use of the facilities and related equipment therein. For more information related to manufacturing and supply agreements with Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. (“Thermo”) and Catalent, Inc. (“Catalent”), please refer to Note 21, Commitments and Contingencies . As of December 31, 2021 , ROU assets for operating leases were $ 45.5 million and operating lease liabilities were $ 56.6 million. The following table contains a summary of the lease costs recognized and other information pertaining to the Company’s operating leases for the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 (in thousands) Lease cost Operating lease cost $ 28,737 $ 18,978 Variable lease cost 18,742 17,065 Total lease cost $ 47,479 $ 36,043 Other information Operating lease payments $ 24,449 $ 19,344 Operating lease liabilities arising from obtaining ROU assets 13,225 59,327 Weighted average remaining lease term 3.5 years 4.6 years Weighted average discount rate 7.6 % 7.6 % F- 34 The following table summarizes maturities of lease liabilities and the reconciliation of lease liabilities as of December 31, 2021: For the Year Ended December 31, 2021 (in thousands) 2022 $ 18,702 2023 18,326 2024 17,582 2025 9,052 2026 571 Thereafter — Total minimum lease payments 64,233 Less: imputed interest ( 7,672 ) Total operating lease liabilities $ 56,561 Included in the consolidated balance sheet: Current portion of lease liabilities within other current liabilities $ 15,049 Lease liabilities 41,512 Total operating lease liabilities $ 56,561 20. NET LOSS PER SHARE Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding. Given that the Company recorded a net loss for each of the periods presented, there is no difference between basic and diluted net loss per share since the effect of common stock equivalents would be anti-dilutive and are, therefore, excluded from the diluted net loss per share calculation. For the Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 (in thousands, except per share amounts) Net loss $ ( 418,780 ) $ ( 554,128 ) $ ( 715,075 ) Weighted-average common shares outstanding - basic 81,262 77,956 73,615 Effect of dilutive securities* — — — Weighted-average common shares outstanding - diluted 81,262 77,956 73,615 Net loss per share — basic and diluted $ ( 5.15 ) $ ( 7.11 ) $ ( 9.71 ) * For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, stock options, RSAs, RSUs and ESPP to purchase approximately 9.7 million, 9.0 million and 9.1 million shares of common stock, respectively, were excluded from the net loss per share calculation as their effect would have been anti-dilutive. The Company accounts for the effect of the 2024 Notes on diluted net earnings per share using the if-converted method as this obligation may be settled in cash or shares at the Company’s option. The effect of potential share settlement is included in the diluted net earnings per share calculation if the effect is more dilutive. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the inclusion of the potential share settlement of the 2024 Notes was anti-dilutive. Accordingly, the potential conversion of 7,763,552 shares has been excluded from the computation of diluted net earnings per share as of December 31, 2021. 21. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Manufacturing Obligations The Company has entered into long-term contractual arrangements from time to time for the provision of goods and services. Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. The Company entered into a development, commercial manufacturing, and supply agreement in June 2018 and, subsequently, entered into the first and second amendments in May 2019 and July 2020, respectively, with Thermo, formerly Brammer Bio MA, LLC (collectively, the “Thermo Agreements”). Pursuant to the terms of the Thermo Agreements, the Company had access to substantially all of the facility’s eight clean room suites for the Company’s gene therapy programs, subject to certain minimum and maximum volume limitations. The Company determined that the Thermo Agreements contained a lease because the Company had the right to direct the use of the facility and related equipment therein. The lease on four of the eight dedicated clean F- 35 room suites at Thermo commenced during 2020 and the remaining four commenced during 2021, which is when the dedicated clean room suites became available for use by the Company. In October 2021, the Company executed a third amendment (the “Amendment”) that modified the terms of the Thermo Agreements. The modification significantly decreased the Company’s right of use of the facility’s capacity and significantly reduced the fixed and in-substance fixed payments due over the remaining term of the agreement. The modification was accounted for as a lease termination, resulting in: (i) the derecognition of right of use assets of $ 23.4 million, (ii) the derecognition of lease liabilities of $ 20.1 million, and (iii) the recognition of a loss of $ 3.3 million, which is included in research and development expense. In addition, as a result of the capacity changes associated with the Amendment, $ 21.1 million of accelerated amortization of nonrefundable advance payments made to Thermo that were previously recorded as other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets were charged to research and development expense. Under the Amendment, the Thermo Agreements will expire on December 31, 2028 , or earlier if certain conditions are met. The Company has the ability to extend the term with an 18-months’ notice and an agreement between the two parties. The Company also has the ability to terminate the Thermo Agreements prior to expiration, subject to the payment of additional financial consideration. Further, the Company has committed to guaranteed purchases under the Amendment on a take-or-pay basis regardless of whether services or goods are ordered. As of December 31, 2021, the Company believes it is probable that the guaranteed purchase requirements will be met in the normal course of business throughout the term of the agreement. Catalent, Inc. The Company entered into a manufacturing collaboration agreement and, subsequently, entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement with Catalent, formerly Paragon Biosciences, Inc. in October 2018 and February 2019, respectively (collectively, the “Catalent Agreements”). Pursuant to the terms of the Catalent Agreements, Catalent agreed to provide the Company with two dedicated clean room suites and an option to reserve two additional clean room suites for its gene therapy programs, subject to certain minimum and maximum volume limitations. In September 2019, the Company exercised the option to gain access to the two additional clean room suites. The Catalent Agreements will expire on December 31, 2024 . The Company has the ability to terminate the Catalent Agreements prior to expiration, subject to the payment of additional financial consideration. The Company determined that the Catalent Agreements contained a lease because the Company had the right to direct the use of the facility and related equipment therein. The lease on all four dedicated clean room suites at Catalent commenced during 2020, which is when the dedicated clean room suites became available for use by the Company. In March 2021, the Company modified the terms of the Catalent Agreements. The modification decreased the Company’s right of use of certain dedicated clean room suites and reduced the fixed and in-substance fixed payments due over the remaining term of the agreement. The modification was accounted for as a partial lease termination, resulting in: (i) the derecognition of right of use assets of $ 22.8 million, (ii) the derecognition of lease liabilities of $ 20.0 million, and (iii) the recognition of a loss of $ 2.8 million, which is included in research and development expense. Aldevron, LLC The Company entered into a clinical and commercial supply agreement in December 2018, as subsequently amended in June 2020, with Aldevron LLC (“Aldevron”) for the supply of plasmid DNA to fulfill its needs for gene therapy clinical trials and commercial supply (collectively, the “Aldevron Agreements”). Pursuant to the terms of the Aldevron Agreements, Aldevron agreed to reserve a certain amount of manufacturing capacity on a quarterly basis. In return, the Company is required to make advance payments to Aldevron related to the manufacturing capacity. The term of the Aldevron Agreements will expire on December 31, 2026 . The Company has the option to extend the term of the Aldevron Agreements by one year if the Company delivers a written notice of its intention to extend to Aldevron no later than June 1, 2025. Both parties have the right to early terminate without additional penalty. The Company has determined that the Aldevron Agreements do not contain an embedded lease because it does not convey the right to control the use of Aldevron’s facility or related equipment therein. The following table presents non-cancelable contractual obligations arising from long-term contractual arrangements, including obligations related to leases embedded in certain supply agreements: As of December 31, 2021 (in thousands) 2022 $ 647,124 2023 178,345 2024 138,725 2025 100,838 2026 54,720 Thereafter 109,440 Total manufacturing commitments $ 1,229,192 F- 36 Additionally, should the Company obtain regulatory approval for any drug product candidate produced as a part of the Company’s manufacturing obligations above, additional minimum batch requirements with the respective manufacturing parties would be required. Other Funding Commitments The Company has several on-going clinical trials in various clinical trial stages. Its most significant clinical trial expenditures are to contract research organizations (“CROs”). The CRO contracts are generally cancellable at the Company’s option. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has approximately $ 378.5 million in cancellable future commitments based on existing CRO contracts. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized approximately $ 47.9 million, $ 40.4 million and $ 31.6 million, respectively, for expenditures incurred by CROs. Litigation In the normal course of business, the Company may from time to time be named as a party to various legal claims, actions and complaints, including matters involving securities, employment, intellectual property, arising from the use of therapeutics utilizing its technology, or others. We record a loss contingency reserve for a legal proceeding when we consider the potential loss probable and we can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss or determine a probable range of loss. We provide disclosure when we consider a loss reasonably possible or when we determine that a loss in excess of a reserve is reasonably possible. We provide an estimate of such reasonably possible losses or an aggregate range of such reasonably possible losses, unless we believe that such an estimate cannot be made. The Company has not recorded any material accruals for loss contingencies and in management's opinion no material range of loss is estimable for the matters described below as of December 31, 2021. On September 15, 2020, REGENXBIO INC. (“RegenX”) and the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania filed a lawsuit against the Company and Sarepta Therapeutics Three, LLC (together, “Sarepta”), in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. The plaintiffs assert patent infringement of U.S. Patent No. 10,526,617 (“the ‘617 Patent”) under 35 U.S.C.§§ 271(a)-(c) based on Sarepta’s alleged direct or indirect manufacture and use of the patented cultured host cell technology allegedly used to make adeno-associated virus (“AAV”) gene therapy products, including SRP-9001. Specifically, the Complaint essentially includes the allegation that Sarepta’s use, and the use by its contract manufacturers on its behalf, of a host cell containing a recombinant acid molecule that encodes a capsid protein having at least 95% amino acid identity to AAVrh10 infringes upon the ‘617 Patent asserted by RegenX. Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief, a judgment of infringement and willful infringement, an unspecified amount of damages that is no less than a reasonable royalty (treble damages), attorneys’ fees and costs, and such other relief as the court deems just and proper. On January 4, 2022, the Court denied Sarepta’s motion to dismiss the case pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) based on the Safe Harbor provision of non-infringement contained in 35 U.S.C. § 271(e)(1). Sarepta answered the Complaint on January 18, 2022, and a case schedule has been set with a trial commencing on January 29, 2024. On July 13, 2021, Nippon Shinyaku Co., Ltd. (“Nippon Shinyaku” or “NS”) filed a lawsuit against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. NS asserts a claim for breach of contract arising from Sarepta filing seven petitions for Inter Partes Review (“IPR Petitions”) with the Patent Trial and Appeal Board at the USPTO (PTAB Case Nos. IPR2021-01134, IPR2021-01135, IPR2021-01136, IPR2021-01137, IPR2021-01138, IPR2021-01139, IPR2021-01140) in which Sarepta is seeking to invalidate certain NS patents concerning exon 53 skipping technology (U.S. Patent Nos. 9,708,361, 10,385,092, 10,407,461, 10,487,106, 10,647,741, 10,662,217, and 10,683,322, respectively, and collectively the “NS Patents”). In addition, NS asserts claims for patent infringement and willful infringement of each of the NS Patents arising from Sarepta’s alleged activities concerning, including the sale of, its exon 53 skipping product, VYONDYS 53 (golodirsen). NS further seeks a determination of non-infringement by NS arising from NS’s alleged activities concerning, including the sale of, its exon 53 skipping product, Viltepso (viltolarsen) and invalidity of certain patents licensed to the Company from UWA (U.S. Patent Nos. 9,994,851, 10,227,590, and 10,266,827, collectively the “UWA Patents”). NS is seeking legal fees and costs, an unspecified amount of monetary relief (treble damages) attributed to Sarepta’s alleged infringement, and such other relief as the court deems just and proper. NS filed a motion for preliminary injunction solely seeking Sarepta’s withdrawal of the IPR Petitions. The district court denied NS’ motion for preliminary injunction on September 24, 2021, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed and remanded the district court on February 8, 2022. The deadline for the Company to seek rehearing of the Federal Circuit decision is March 10, 2022. In January 2022, the PTAB granted institution of all claims of all NS Patents in response to Sarepta’s IPR Petitions and determined that Sarepta has demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of success in proving that the NS Patents are unpatentable. On December 27, 2021, the district court partially granted and denied the motion to dismiss by Sarepta and ordered NS to file a Second Amended Complaint (“SAC”), which it did on January 14, 2022. In the SAC, NS maintains all claims of the original complaint of July 13, 2021, except a determination of non-infringement of the UWA Patents. On January 28, 2022, Sarepta filed its answer to the SAC, with defenses and counterclaims against NS and NS Pharma Inc. that include infringement of the UWA Patents arising from their alleged activities concerning, including the sale of, its exon 53 skipping product, Viltepso (viltolarsen) and breach of contract. Sarepta is also seeking a determination of invalidity of the NS Patents. Sarepta is seeking an award of relief in its defenses to NS’ allegations, a judgment of breach of contract, a determination of invalidity of the NS Patents, a judgment of infringement and willful infringement of the UWA Patents, legal fees and costs, an unspecified amount of monetary relief (treble damages) attributed to NS’ alleged infringement, and such other relief as the court deems just and proper. Case scheduling in district court, including a trial date, will follow. F- 37",0000873303,SRPT

We undertake no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K after the date of this report, except as required by law or the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) . We caution readers not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and other written and oral forward-looking statements made by us from time to time, are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements, including the risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified under the heading “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. -3- Risk Factors Summary Our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those described in Item 1A “Risk Factors”. These risks include, but are not limited to the following: • We are highly dependent on the commercial success of our products in the U.S. We may not be able to meet expectations with respect to sales of our products or attain profitability and positive cash-flow from operations; • Even though EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53 and AMONDYS 45 have received accelerated approval by the FDA, they face future post-approval development and regulatory requirements, which will present additional challenges we will need to successfully navigate; • We are subject to uncertainty relating to reimbursement policies which, if not favorable, could hinder or prevent the commercial success of our products and/or product candidates; • Our products may not be widely adopted by patients, payors or healthcare providers, which would adversely impact our potential profitability and future business prospects; • We cannot predict whether historical revenues from eteplirsen and golodirsen through our early access program (“EAP”) outside the U.S. will continue or whether we will be able to continue to distribute eteplirsen and golodirsen through our EAP; • We face intense competition and rapid technological change, which may result in other companies discovering, developing or commercializing competitive products; • We have entered into multiple collaborations, including our collaboration with Roche, and may seek or engage in future collaborations, strategic alliances, acquisitions or licensing agreements that complement or expand our business. We may not be able to complete such transactions, and such transactions, if executed, may increase our capital requirements, dilute our stockholders, cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities and subject us to other risks; • We may find it difficult to enroll patients in our clinical trials, which could delay or prevent clinical trials of our product candidates; • Failures or delays in the commencement or completion of ongoing and planned clinical trials of our product candidates negatively impact commercialization efforts; result in increased costs; and delay, prevent or limit our ability to gain regulatory approval of product candidates and to generate revenues and continue our business; • Results from pre-clinical and early‑stage clinical trials may not be indicative of efficacy in late‑stage clinical trials, and pre-clinical and clinical trials may fail to demonstrate acceptable levels of safety, efficacy, and quality of our product candidates, which could prevent or significantly delay their regulatory approval; • Our product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of product candidates, limit the commercial potential or result in significant negative consequences following any potential marketing approval; • If there are significant delays in obtaining or we are unable to obtain or maintain required regulatory approvals, we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates in a timely manner or at all, which could impair our ability to generate sufficient revenue and have a successful business; • We are investing significant resources in the development of novel gene therapy product candidates. Only a few gene therapy products have been approved in the U.S. and EU. If we are unable to show the safety and efficacy of these product candidates, experience delays in doing so or are unable to successfully commercialize at least one of these drugs, our business would be materially harmed; • Because we are developing product candidates for the treatment of certain diseases in which there is little clinical experience and we are using new endpoints or methodologies, there is increased risk that the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authorities may not consider the endpoints of our clinical trials to provide clinically meaningful results and that these results may be difficult to analyze; • We may not be able to advance all of our programs, and we may use our financial and human resources to pursue particular programs and fail to capitalize on programs that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success; • If we are unable to maintain our agreements with third parties to distribute our products to patients, our results of operations and business could be adversely affected; • We rely on third parties to conduct some aspects of our early stage research and pre-clinical and clinical development. The inadequate performance by or loss of any of these third parties could affect the development and commercialization of our product candidate development. The third parties we use in the manufacturing process for our products and product candidates may fail to comply with cGMP regulations; • We currently rely on third parties to manufacture our products and to produce our product candidates; our dependence on these parties, including failure on our part to accurately anticipate product demand and timely secure manufacturing capacity to meet commercial, EAP, clinical and pre-clinical product demand may impair the availability of product to successfully support various programs, including research and development and the potential commercialization of our product candidates; -4- • Products intended for use in gene therapies are novel, complex and difficult to manufacture. We could experience production problems that result in delays in our development or commercialization of gene therapy programs, limit the supply of our products or otherwise harm our business ; • Our success, competitive position and future revenue depend in part on our ability and the abilities of our licensors and other collaborators to obtain, maintain and defend the patent protection for our products, product candidates, and platform technologies, to preserve our trade secrets, and to prevent third parties from infringing on our proprietary rights; • The outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted and may continue to result in disruptions to our commercialization, clinical trials, manufacturing and other business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and prospects; • We have incurred operating losses since our inception and we may not achieve or sustain profitability; • We will need to raise additional funding, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed may force us to delay, limit or terminate our product development efforts or other operations; • Our stock price is volatile and may fluctuate due to factors beyond our control; • Our revenues and operating results could fluctuate significantly, which may adversely affect our stock price; and • Our indebtedness resulting from our credit agreement could adversely affect our financial condition or restrict our future operations. -5- PART I Item 1. Business. Overview We are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on helping patients through the discovery and development of unique RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene therapy and other genetic therapeutic modalities for the treatment of rare diseases. Applying our proprietary, highly-differentiated and innovative technologies, and through collaborations with our strategic partners, we are developing potential therapeutic candidates for a broad range of diseases and disorders, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy (“DMD”), Limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (“LGMDs”) and other neuromuscular and central nervous system (“CNS”) related disorders. Our first commercial product, EXONDYS 51 (eteplirsen) Injection (“EXONDYS 51”), was granted accelerated approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) on September 19, 2016. EXONDYS 51 is indicated for the treatment of DMD in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 51 skipping. EXONDYS 51 uses our phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (“PMO”) chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 51 of the dystrophin gene. Our second commercial product, VYONDYS 53 (golodirsen) Injection (“VYONDYS 53”), was granted accelerated approval by the FDA on December 12, 2019. VYONDYS 53 is indicated for the treatment of DMD in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 53 skipping. VYONDYS 53 uses our PMO chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 53 of the dystrophin gene. Our third commercial product, AMONDYS 45 (casimersen) Injection (“AMONDYS 45”), was granted accelerated approval by the FDA on February 25, 2021. AMONDYS 45 is indicated for the treatment of DMD in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 45 skipping. AMONDYS 45 uses our PMO chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 45 of the dystrophin gene. Exon skipping is intended to promote the production of an internally truncated but functional dystrophin protein. The original PMO structure and variations of this structure that are so-called PMO-based (collectively “PMO-based”) are central to our proprietary chemistry platform. PMO technologies can be used to selectively up-regulate or down-regulate the production of a target protein through pre-mRNA splice alteration. PMO-based compounds have the potential to be designed to create more, less, or none of certain proteins, or produce analogues of endogenous proteins. This technology can be used to correct disease-causing genetic errors by inducing the targeted expression of novel proteins. The PMO chemistry platform is highly adaptable, and we have developed next-generation PMO-based chemistries for advancing RNA-targeted therapeutics. These next-generation chemistries are specifically designed to enhance tissue targeting, intracellular delivery, target selectivity and drug potency. One of these novel technologies is based on cell-penetrating peptide-conjugated PMO (“PPMO”). The PPMO features covalent attachment of a cell-penetrating peptide to a PMO with the goal of enhanced delivery into the cell. Our most advanced PPMO product candidate is SRP-5051, which is designed to treat DMD in patients with genetic mutations amenable to exon 51 skipping. As part of our multifaceted approach to DMD, we are also developing gene therapy technologies to treat DMD. We are clinically developing a product candidate, SRP-9001, that aims to express a smaller but still functional version of dystrophin (“micro-dystrophin”). We use a unique adeno-associated virus (“AAV”) vector called AAVrh.74 to transport the transgene – the genetic material that will make the protein of interest – to the target cells. Micro-dystrophin is used because naturally-occurring dystrophin is too large to fit in an AAV. We are also developing gene therapy programs for various forms of LGMDs. Our most advanced LGMD product candidate, SRP-9003, is designed to transfer a gene that codes for and restores beta-sarcoglycan protein with the goal of restoring the dystrophin associated protein complex. SRP-9003 utilizes the AAVrh.74 vector, the same vector used in SRP-9001. Our pipeline includes more than 40 programs at various stages of discovery, pre-clinical and clinical development, reflecting our aspiration to apply our multifaceted approach and expertise in precision genetic medicine to make a profound difference in the lives of patients suffering from rare diseases. -6- Objectives and Business Strategy We believe that our proprietary technology platforms and collaborations can be used to develop novel pharmaceutical products to treat a broad range of diseases and address key currently-unmet medical needs. We intend to leverage our technology platforms, organizational capabilities, collaborations and resources to lead the field of precision genetic medicines, including the treatment of rare, neuromuscular and other diseases, with a diversified portfolio of product candidates. In pursuit of this objective, we intend to focus on the following activities: • continuing to build our gene therapy engine, including developing gene therapy product candidates, operationalizing our manufacturing strategy and furthering our commercial capabilities in preparation for potential regulatory approvals; • advancing our RNA technologies (e.g., PMO and PPMO), launching potential approved products and supporting commercialization of approved products; • investing in next-generation precision medicine through internal research, strategic partnerships, collaborations and other potential opportunities; and • continuing to nurture our culture, which is based on strong patient focus, bias to action, a self-starter mentality, smart and appropriate risk-taking and high ethics. Core Therapeutic Areas DMD : We primarily focus on rapidly advancing the development of our potentially disease-modifying pipeline of exon-skipping, gene therapy and gene editing product candidates targeting DMD. DMD is a rare X-linked recessive genetic disorder affecting children (primarily males) that is characterized by progressive muscle deterioration and weakness. It is the most common type of muscular dystrophy. DMD is caused by an absence of dystrophin, a protein that protects muscle cells. The absence of dystrophin in muscle cells leads to significant cell damage and ultimately causes muscle cell death and fibrotic replacement. In the absence of dystrophin protein, affected individuals generally experience the following symptoms, although disease severity and life expectancy vary: • muscle damage characterized by inflammation, fibrosis and loss of myofibers beginning at an early age; • muscle weakness and progressive loss of muscle function beginning in the first few years of life; • decline of ambulation and respiratory function after the age of seven; • total loss of ambulation in the pre-teenage or early teenage years; • progressive loss of upper extremity function during mid- to late-teens; and • respiratory and/or cardiac failure, resulting in death before the age of 30. LGMDs are autosomal recessive, monogenic, rare neuromuscular diseases caused by missense and deletion mutations. These diseases affect males and females equally. Some types of LGMDs affect skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle. More severe forms of LGMDs mimic DMD. LGMDs as a class affect an estimated range of approximately 1 in every 14,500 to 1 in every 123,000 individuals. Currently, there are no available treatment options for LGMDs. Charcot-Marie-tooth Disease, or CMT is a group of hereditary, degenerative nerve diseases that are caused by mutations in genes that produce proteins involved in the structure and function of either the peripheral nerve axon or the myelin sheath. CMT can cause degeneration of motor skills, resulting in muscle weakness, and limiting patients’ ability to walk or use their hands, and in some cases, can cause degeneration of sensory nerves, resulting in a reduced ability to feel heat, cold, and pain. CMT affects approximately 1 in every 2,500 individuals, while CMT type 1A, which is most often caused by an extra copy of the PMP22 gene, affects approximately 50,000 patients in the U.S. Most patients are diagnosed at infancy, while other patients develop symptoms at adolescence. Currently, there are no available treatment options. -7- Our Commercial Products EXONDYS 51 , our first commercial product, approved by the FDA on September 19, 2016, is indicated for the treatment of DMD in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 51 skipping. EXONDYS 51 uses our PMO chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 51 of the dystrophin gene. PMO-based compounds are synthetic compounds that bind to complementary sequences of RNA by standard Watson-Crick nucleobase pairing. The two key structural differences between PMO-based compounds and naturally occurring RNA are that the PMO nucleobases are bound to synthetic morpholino rings instead of ribose rings, and the morpholino rings are linked by phosphorodiamidate groups instead of phosphodiester groups. Replacement of the negatively charged phosphodiester in RNA with the uncharged phosphorodiamidate group in PMO eliminates linkage ionization at physiological pH. Due to these modifications, PMO-based compounds are resistant to degradation by plasma and intracellular enzymes. Unlike the RNA-targeted technologies such as siRNAs and DNA gapmers, PMO-based compounds operate by steric blockade rather than by cellular enzymatic degradation to achieve their biological effects. Thus, PMOs use a fundamentally different mechanism from other RNA-targeted technologies. EXONDYS 51 targets the most frequent series of mutations that cause DMD. Approximately 13% of DMD patients are amenable to exon 51 skipping. We are in the process of conducting various EXONDYS 51 clinical trials, including studies that are required to comply with our post-marketing FDA requirements/commitments to verify and describe the clinical benefit of EXONDYS 51. VYONDYS 53 , our second commercial product, approved by the FDA on December 12, 2019, is indicated for the treatment of DMD in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 53 skipping. VYONDYS 53 uses our PMO chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 53 of the dystrophin gene. VYONDYS 53 has the potential to offer treatment to up to 8% of DMD patients who are amenable to exon 53 skipping. We are in the process of conducting various VYONDYS 53 clinical trials, including studies that are required to comply with our post-marketing FDA requirements/commitments to verify and describe the clinical benefit of VYONDYS 53. AMONDYS 45 , our third commercial product, approved by the FDA on February 25, 2021, is indicated for the treatment of DMD in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 45 skipping. AMONDYS 45 uses our PMO chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 45 of the dystrophin gene. AMONDYS 45 has the potential to offer treatment to up to 8% of DMD patients who are amenable to exon 45 skipping. We are in the process of conducting various AMONDYS 45 clinical trials, including studies that are required to comply with our post-marketing FDA requirements/commitments to verify and describe the clinical benefit of AMONDYS 45. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the Company recorded net revenue of $455.9 million, $380.8 million, and $301.0 million, respectively, related to the sale of our products. Our Pipeline – Key Programs SRP-5051 uses our next-generation chemistry platform, PPMO, and our exon-skipping technology to skip exon 51 of the dystrophin gene. The PPMO technology features covalent attachment of a cell-penetrating peptide to a PMO with the goal of enhanced delivery into the cell. In pre-clinical research, our proprietary class of PPMO compounds demonstrated an increase in dystrophin production and a more durable response compared to PMO. In addition, PPMO treatment in non-human primates results in high levels of exon-skipping in skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle tissues. Pre-clinical trials also indicate that PPMOs may require less frequent dosing than PMOs, and that PPMOs could potentially be tailored to reach other organs beyond muscle. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we commenced a first-in-human, single ascending dose, trial for the treatment of DMD using SRP-5051 in patients who are amenable to exon 51 skipping. In 2019, we commenced a multiple ascending dose study for the treatment of DMD with SRP-5051 in patients who are amenable to exon 51 skipping (“Study 5051-201”). In December 2020, we announced an interim analysis on clinical results from the 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg dose cohorts of Part A of Study 5051-201. We expect to announce results from the next cohort of Part A of Study 5051-201 at 30 mg/kg in the second quarter of 2021. SRP-9001 (DMD, micro-dystrophin gene therapy program) , aims to express micro-dystrophin – a smaller but still functional version of dystrophin. A unique, engineered micro-dystrophin is used because naturally-occurring dystrophin is too large to fit in an AAV vector. SRP-9001 employs the AAVrh.74 vector, which is designed to be systemically and robustly delivered to skeletal, diaphragm and cardiac muscle without promiscuously crossing the blood brain barrier, which we believe makes it a strong candidate to treat peripheral neuromuscular diseases. An MHCK7 promoter was chosen for its ability to robustly express in the heart, which is critically important for patients with DMD, who typically die from pulmonary or cardiac complications. Lastly, the transgene was designed to maintain spectrin-like repeats 2 and 3, which has been reported to be critical to maintaining muscle force. -8- In the fourth quarter of 2017, an investigational new drug (“ IND ”) application for the micro-dystrophin gene therapy program was cleared by the FDA, and a Phase 1/2a clinical trial in individuals with DMD was initiated (Study 10 1 ) . I n October 2018, Nationwide Children’s Hospital (“Nationwide”) presented updated results from Study 10 1 in four individuals with DMD enrolled in the trial. I n March 2019, we presented nine -month functional and CK data from baseline from these four individuals, and twelve -month CK data from baseline from one of these individuals. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we commenced a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of SRP-9001 with the goal to establish the functional benefits of micro-dystrophin expressions (Study 102) . We dosed all 4 1 participants in that trial and have begun dosing participants i n the crossover phase of the study . In January 2021, we released top-line results for Part 1 of Study 102 (the 48-week assessment of the 41 participants) and interim expression results from Part 2 of Study 102 (the crossover phase ) . We expect additional results from Part 2 of Study 102 in the first quarter of 202 2 . We commenced dosing in Study 103, an open-label study evaluating the safety and expression of commercially representative material for SRP-9001, and expect to report biomarker and safety results from Study 103 in the second quarter of 2021. SRP-9003 (LGMD, gene therapy program) . We are developing gene therapy programs for various types of LGMDs. Our LGMD programs use the AAVrh.74 vector, the same vector used in the micro-dystrophin gene therapy program, to transfect a restorative gene. The most advanced of our LGMD product candidates, SRP-9003, aims to treat LGMD2E, also known as beta-sarcoglycanopathy, a severe and debilitating form of LGMD characterized by progressive muscle fiber loss, inflammation and muscle fiber replacement with fat and fibrotic tissue. SRP-9003 is designed to transfect a gene that codes for and restores beta-sarcoglycan protein with the goal of restoring the dystrophin associated protein complex. SRP-9003 has generated positive pre-clinical safety and efficacy data utilizing the AAVrh.74 vector. A Phase 1/2a trial of SRP-9003 was commenced in the fourth quarter of 2018. In February 2019, we announced two-month biopsy data from the first three-patient cohort dosed in the SRP-9003 trial, and in October 2019, we announced nine-month functional data from these three patients. In June 2020, we announced safety and expression results from three clinical trial participants in the high-dose cohort measured at 60 days, and one-year functional data from three clinical trial participants in the high-dose cohort, and eighteen-month functional data from three clinical trial participants in the low-dose cohort. We expect to complete GMP runs for SRP-9003 in 2021. We also expect to seek FDA confirmation to initiate our pivotal trial in 2021. -9- The chart below summarizes the status of our programs, including those with our strategic partners: -10- Manufacturing, Supply and Distribution We have developed proprietary state-of-the-art Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (“CMC”) and manufacturing capabilities that allow synthesis and purification of our products and product candidates to support both clinical development as well as commercialization. Our current main focus in manufacturing is to continue scaling up production of our PMO-based therapies and optimizing manufacturing for PPMO and gene therapy-based product candidates. We have entered into certain manufacturing and supply arrangements with third-party suppliers which will in part utilize these capabilities to support production of certain of our product candidates and their components. In 2017, we opened a facility in Andover, Massachusetts, which significantly enhanced our research and development manufacturing capabilities. However, we currently do not have internal large-scale Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMP”) manufacturing capabilities to produce our products and product candidates for commercial and/or clinical use. For our current and future manufacturing needs, we have entered into supply agreements with specialized contract manufacturing organizations (each a “CMO”) to produce custom raw materials, the active pharmaceutical ingredients (“APIs”), drug product and finished goods for our products and product candidates for both commercial and clinical use. All of our CMO partners have extensive technical expertise, GMP experience and experience manufacturing our specific technology. For our commercial DMD program, we have worked with our existing manufacturers to increase product capacity from mid-scale to large-scale. While there are a limited number of companies that can produce raw materials and APIs in the quantities and with the quality and purity that we require for our commercial products, based on our diligence to date, we believe our current network of manufacturing partners are able to fulfill these requirements, and are capable of expanding capacity as needed. Additionally, we have, and will continue to evaluate further relationships with additional suppliers to increase overall capacity as well as further reduce risks associated with reliance on a limited number of suppliers for manufacturing. Our commercial products are distributed in the U.S. through a limited network of home infusion specialty pharmacy providers that deliver the medication to patients and a specialty distributor that distributes our products to hospitals and hospital outpatient clinics. With respect to the pre-commercial distribution of our products to patients outside of the U.S., we have contracted with third party distributors and service providers to distribute our products in certain countries through our EAPs. We plan to continue building out our network for commercial distribution in jurisdictions in which our products are approved. Our gene therapy manufacturing capabilities have been greatly enhanced through partnerships with Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (“Thermo”), Catalent, Inc. (“Catalent”) and Aldevron LLC (“Aldevron”). We have adopted a hybrid development and manufacturing strategy in which we are building internal manufacturing expertise relative to all aspects of AAV-based manufacturing, including gene therapy and gene editing supply, while closely partnering with first-in-class manufacturing partners to expedite development and commercialization of our gene therapy programs. We expect that our partnerships with Thermo and Catalent will support our clinical and commercial manufacturing capacity for our micro-dystrophin DMD gene therapy programs and LGMD programs, while also acting as a manufacturing platform for potential future gene therapy programs. The collaboration integrates process development, clinical production and testing, and commercial manufacturing. Aldevron is expected to provide GMP-grade plasmid for our SRP-9001 micro-dystrophin DMD gene therapy program and LGMD programs, as well as plasmid source material for future gene therapy programs, such as CMT and other neuromuscular and CNS related disorders. Manufacturers and suppliers of our commercial products and product candidates are subject to the FDA’s current GMP (“cGMP”) requirements and other rules and regulations prescribed by foreign regulatory authorities. We depend on our third-party partners for continued compliance with cGMP requirements and applicable foreign standards. Material Agreements We believe that our RNA-targeted and gene therapy technologies could be broadly applicable for the potential development of pharmaceutical products in many therapeutic areas. To further exploit our core technologies, we have and may continue to enter into research, development or commercialization alliances with universities, hospitals, independent research centers, non-profit organizations, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and other entities for specific molecular targets or selected disease indications. We may also selectively pursue opportunities to access certain intellectual property rights that complement our internal portfolio through license agreements or other arrangements. Roche License, Collaboration, and Option Agreement On December 21, 2019, we entered into a License, Collaboration, and Option Agreement (the “Collaboration Agreement”) with F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd (“Roche”) pursuant to which we granted Roche an exclusive license under certain of our intellectual property rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize SRP-9001 in all countries outside of the U.S. We retained all rights to SRP-9001 in the U.S. The transaction closed on February 14, 2020. -11- Also, under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, Roche granted us a license to use certain of its intellectual property rights to perform development activities worldwide under a joint global development plan , commercialize SRP-9001 in the U . S . , and perform certain manufacturing and medical affairs activities worldwide . Such license is non-exclusive under Roche’s background intellectual property rights , exclusive in the U.S. under intellectual property rights developed by Roche under the Collaboration Agreement , and non-exclusive outside the U.S. under intellectual property rights developed by Roche under the Collaboration Agreement . We intend to manufacture and supply all clinical and, upon approval in the relevant market, commercial supply of SRP-9001. Roche Options and Negotiation Rights Pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, we granted Roche an exclusive option to obtain an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize the following products outside of the U.S.: (i) certain exon-skipping products that target the dystrophin gene to induce exon skipping, including eteplirsen, golodirsen, casimersen and SRP-5051; (ii) certain gene therapy products other than SRP-9001 that encode and directly express dystrophin or a derivative thereof; and (iii) certain gene-editing products that modify, repair, or activate an endogenous dysfunctional dystrophin gene. The products subject to Roche’s options are collectively referred to as the “Option Products.” Upon option exercise, the Option Product that is the subject of the option exercise will be included under the Collaboration Agreement as a product licensed to Roche subject to similar obligations, including with respect to development, manufacturing, commercialization, and cost-sharing as those that apply to SRP-9001. Pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, Roche has a right of first negotiation if we seek to grant a third-party license to (a) commercialize SRP-9001 in the U.S. or (b) commercialize any of our LGMDs products. Exclusivity Other than under the Collaboration Agreement, Roche may not perform any clinical trials for, or commercialize, any gene therapy product, gene-editing product, or antisense oligonucleotide for DMD for a period of five years following the execution of the Collaboration Agreement. The exclusivity period for one or more types of products may be extended if Roche exercises its option with respect to one or more exon-skipping products, gene therapy products, or gene-editing products, in each case, for a period of five years from the time of option exercise. Development The parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct development activities with respect to SRP-9001 under the Collaboration Agreement pursuant to agreed-upon development plans. We will perform all development activities directed to obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for SRP-9001 in the U.S. and the European Union (“EU”), as set forth in a joint global development plan. Subject to certain exceptions, the parties will share the costs of the development activities under such joint global development plan. Roche will have sole responsibility to perform all development activities set forth in a territory-specific development plan for SRP-9001, including additional activities not set forth in the joint global development plan that are specifically directed to obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for SRP-9001 outside of the U.S. Roche will be solely responsible for costs arising from the territory-specific development plan for SRP-9001. Governance Governing committees will facilitate collaboration between the parties with respect to development, manufacturing, medical affairs, intellectual property protection, and commercialization of SRP-9001 and any other licensed products. Financial Terms In consideration for the rights that we granted and for prepaid funding for development activities, in February 2020, Roche and Roche Finance Ltd, an affiliate of Roche (“Roche Finance”), together paid us an up-front payment of approximately $1.2 billion, comprised of $750.0 million in cash from Roche and approximately $400.0 million from Roche Finance in exchange for 2,522,227 shares of our common stock, priced at $158.59 per share under the Stock Purchase Agreement described below. Additionally, we are eligible to receive up to $1.7 billion in regulatory and sales milestone payments with respect to SRP-9001. In addition, the Collaboration Agreement provides that Roche will pay us royalties on net sales of SRP-9001, anticipated to be in the mid-teens. In the event that Roche chooses to exercise its option with respect to one or more Option Products, we will be paid an option exercise fee upon each such exercise and the Option Products that are the subject of the option exercise will be subject to separate milestone payments and royalties on sales of such Option Product. -12- Term; Termination Unless earlier terminated as described below, the Collaboration Agreement will continue with respect to SRP-9001 or any Option Product for which Roche has exercised its option, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until the end of the royalty term for such product in such country. The royalty term expires on the later of (a) twelve years after first commercial sale in such country, (b) loss of regulatory exclusivity in such country and (c) expiration of all valid claims of specific licensed patents in such country. Either party may terminate the Collaboration Agreement for the other party’s material breach if such breach is not cured within a specified cure period. If Roche breaches its development or commercialization diligence obligations with respect to a licensed product or fails to develop or commercialize a particular licensed product in a particular region for a specified period of time, then we may terminate the Collaboration Agreement with respect to such licensed products in such regions. Roche may terminate the Collaboration Agreement if we fail to supply SRP-9001 to Roche in accordance with the terms of the Collaboration Agreement and the supply agreements to be entered into between the parties. Roche may also terminate the Collaboration Agreement for convenience with extended advance notice, in its entirety or on a licensed product-by-licensed product and region-by-region basis. The foregoing description of the terms of the Collaboration Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Collaboration Agreement, a copy of which is filed as an exhibit to this Annual Report. Stock Purchase Agreement On December 21, 2019, pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Roche Finance (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”) pursuant to which, in February 2020, we issued and sold 2,522,227 shares (the “Shares”) of common stock to Roche Finance in a private placement for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $400.0 million, or $158.59 per share, with a fair value of $316.3 million. The Stock Purchase Agreement contains other customary terms and conditions, including mutual representations, warranties, and covenants. Myonexus On May 3, 2018, we purchased from Myonexus, a privately-held Delaware corporation, a warrant to purchase common stock of Myonexus (the “Warrant”), which, in combination with amendments to the Myonexus certificate of incorporation, provided us with an exclusive option (the “Option”) to acquire Myonexus. In consideration for the Warrant, we made an up-front payment of $60.0 million to Myonexus. On February 27, 2019, we announced that we exercised the exclusive option to acquire Myonexus and, on April 4, 2019, we paid the Myonexus shareholders approximately $173.8 million and completed the acquisition of Myonexus. We are required to make contingent payments to the former shareholders of Myonexus upon achievement of a threshold amount of net sales of Myonexus products and the receipt and subsequent sale of a Priority Review Voucher with respect to a Myonexus product. BioMarin License Agreement On July 17, 2017, we executed a License Agreement (as amended on April 14, 2019, the “License Agreement”) with BioMarin Leiden Holding BV, BioMarin Nederlands BV and BioMarin Technologies BV (collectively, “BioMarin”), pursuant to which BioMarin granted us a royalty-bearing, worldwide license under patent rights (“Licensed Patents”) and know-how (“Licensed Know-How”) controlled by BioMarin with respect to BioMarin’s DMD program, which are potentially necessary or useful for the treatment of DMD, to practice and exploit the Licensed Patents and Licensed Know-How in all fields of use and for all purposes, including to develop and commercialize antisense oligonucleotide products that target one or more exons of the dystrophin gene to induce exon skipping, including eteplirsen, golodirsen and casimersen (collectively, the “Products”). The license granted by BioMarin is exclusive, even as to BioMarin, with respect to the Licensed Patents, and is non-exclusive with respect to Licensed Know-How. Under the License Agreement, BioMarin has the option to convert the exclusive license under the Licensed Patents into a co-exclusive license (co-exclusive with BioMarin) (“BioMarin Co-Exclusive Option”). -13- Under the terms of the License Agreement, we were required to pay BioMarin an up - front payment of $15 .0 million, and BioMarin is eligible to receive up to $20 .0 million from us per dystrophin gene exon (other than exon 51) targeted by one or more Products in specified regulatory milestones, as well as an additional $10 .0 million milestone, payable following the regulatory approval of eteplirsen by the EMA . BioMarin is also eligible to receive $15 .0 million from us upon the achievement of $650 .0 million in sales of Products , as well as royalties segmented by specified geographic markets, in some jurisdictions dependent on the existence of a patent, ranging from four (4) to eight (8) percentages of net sales on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis. Milestones and royalties are payable with respect to eteplirsen (an exon 51 skipping Product), golodirsen (an exon 53 skipping Product), casimersen (an exon 45 skipping Product) and potentially other Products. For eteplirsen, golodirsen and casimersen, the royalty term will expire upon March 31, 2024 in the U.S., upon December 31, 2024 in the EU and no later than December 31, 2024 in other countries provided certain conditions are met. For Products other than exon 51 skipping Products, exon 53 skipping Products and exon 45 skipping Products, the royalty term will end on a country-by country basis upon expiration of granted Licensed Patents covering the applicable Product. The royalties for all Products are subject to reduction upon BioMarin’s exercise of the BioMarin Co-Exclusive Option. All royalties are subject to further potential reductions, including for generic competition and, under specified conditions, for a specified portion of payments that we may become required to pay under third-party license agreements, subject to a maximum royalty reduction. Unless earlier terminated, the License Agreement will expire upon the expiration of the last-to-expire royalty term. Either party may terminate the License Agreement in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach. BioMarin may also terminate the License Agreement on a Licensed Patent-by-Licensed Patent basis under specified circumstances relating to patent challenges by us. Settlement Agreement On July 17, 2017, Sarepta and The University of Western Australia (“UWA”) on the one hand, and the BioMarin Parties and Academisch Ziekenhuis Leiden (“AZL”) on the other hand (collectively, the “Settlement Parties”), executed a Settlement Agreement pursuant to which all legal actions in the U.S. and certain legal actions in Europe (the “Actions”) would be stopped or withdrawn as between the Settlement Parties. Specifically, the terms of the Settlement Agreement required that existing efforts pursuing ongoing litigation and opposition proceedings would be stopped as between the Settlement Parties, and the Settlement Parties would cooperate to withdraw the Actions before the European Patent Office (except for actions involving third parties), the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the High Court of Justice of England and Wales, except for the cross-appeal of the Interlocutory Decision of the Opposition Division dated April 15, 2013 of the European Patent Office of EP 1619249B1 (“EP ‘249 Appeal”) in which Sarepta agreed to withdraw its appeal and BioMarin/AZL agreed to continue with its appeal with Sarepta having oversight of the continued appeal by BioMarin/AZL. Additionally, under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the Settlement Parties agreed to release each other and the customers, end-users, agents, suppliers, distributors, resellers, contractors, consultants, services and partners of Sarepta or BioMarin (as applicable) from claims and damages related to (i) the patent rights controlled by the releasing party that are involved in the Actions, (ii) with respect to Sarepta and UWA, its patent rights related to the patent rights involved in the Actions, and (iii) with respect to BioMarin and AZL, all of the Licensed Patents and Licensed Know-How. Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Sarepta made an up-front payment of $20.0 million to BioMarin. University of Western Australia In April 2013, we entered into an agreement with UWA under which an existing exclusive license agreement between the two parties was amended and restated and, in June 2016, we entered into the first amendment to the license agreement (the “UWA License Agreement”). The UWA License Agreement grants us specific rights to compounds for the treatment of DMD by inducing exon skipping. EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53 and AMONDYS 45 fall under the scope of the license agreement. Under the UWA License Agreement, we are required to make payments of up to $6.0 million in the aggregate to UWA based on the successful achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones relating to EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53, AMONDYS 45 and up to three additional product candidates. As of December 31, 2020, $3.7 million of the $6.0 million development and regulatory milestone payments had been made. We are also obligated to make payments to UWA of up to $20.0 million upon the achievement of certain sales milestones. Additionally, we are required to pay a low-single-digit percentage royalty on net sales of products covered by issued patents licensed from UWA during the term of the UWA License Agreement. Currently, the latest date on which an issued patent covered by the UWA License Agreement expires is November 2030 (excluding any patent term extension, supplemental protection certificate or pediatric extensions that may be available); however, patents granted from pending patent applications could result in a later expiration date. -14- Key Strategic Alliances In connection with our multi-front battle against DMD and other rare neuromuscular diseases, we have entered into multiple partnering opportunities, including the ones described below. We believe that these collaborations, taken along with our own programs, represent a comprehensive approach to treating these rare neuromuscular diseases. Nationwide Children’s Hospital In December 2015, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Nationwide to acquire exclusive rights to its GALGT2 gene therapy program for neuromuscular related disorders. In addition, in December 2016, we entered into an exclusive option agreement with Nationwide to acquire exclusive rights to their micro-dystrophin gene therapy program as well as a sponsored research agreement to conduct pre-IND research and conduct the first clinical trial with the lead micro-dystrophin gene therapy. In October 2018, we exercised our exclusive license option and an option under the sponsored research agreement and entered into an exclusive license agreement with Nationwide to acquire exclusive rights to its micro-dystrophin gene therapy program, which provides us with exclusive rights to commercialize SRP-9001. Furthermore, in October 2018, we entered into an exclusive option agreement with Nationwide with respect to exclusive rights to its NT-3 gene therapy program for the treatment of certain CMT neuropathy subtypes, including CMT Type 1A. The option agreement contains pre-determined economic terms for the exclusive license to be entered into upon us exercising our option. In addition, in March 2019, we entered into an exclusive option agreement with Nationwide with respect to exclusive rights to its calpain-3 gene therapy program for the treatment of LGMD Type 2A. The option agreement contains pre-determined economic terms for the exclusive license to be entered into upon us exercising our option. Duke University In October 2017, we entered into a sponsored research and exclusive option agreement with Duke University, granting us an exclusive option to an exclusive license to intellectual property and technology related to certain CRISPR/Cas9 technology developed in the laboratory of Charles A. Gersbach, Ph.D. The underlying premise of Dr. Gersbach’s approach is to restore dystrophin expression by removing or “excising” exons from the dystrophin gene. This includes a strategy to excise exons potentially enabling treatment for a majority of the DMD patient population. Genethon In May 2017, we entered into a sponsored research agreement with Genethon, under which we have been collaborating with Genethon on the pre-clinical development of its micro-dystrophin gene therapy products for the treatment of DMD. In November 2019, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Genethon, under which we will collaborate and share costs with Genethon on the clinical development of such products for the treatment of DMD. Under such agreement, we received the exclusive right to commercialize such products in the majority of the world (primarily excluding the EU). For the rights we received under such agreement, we made an up-front payment of $28.0 million; may be required to pay up to $236.3 million in development, regulatory and sales milestones; and upon commercialization, will be required to make tiered royalty payments based on net sales of licensed products. StrideBio On November 13, 2019, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with StrideBio, Inc. (“StrideBio”), a leading developer of novel AAV capsids, to develop in vivo AAV-based therapies for up to eight CNS and neuromuscular targets. Pursuant to the agreement, we were granted an exclusive license on selected targets to leverage StrideBio’s capsid technology intended to enhance specific tropism to tissues of interest and evade neutralizing antibodies. StrideBio will conduct all IND enabling research, development and manufacturing for the first four CNS targets, which are MECP2 (Rett syndrome), SCN1A (Dravet syndrome), UBE3A (Angelman syndrome), and NPC1 (Niemann-Pick). Additionally, we have an exclusive option for up to four additional targets based on StrideBio’s capsid technology. -15- Under the terms of the agreement, StrideBio will be responsible for AAV capsid development, non-clinical development and manufacturing of preclinical candidates to be selected for advancement into clinical studies. The parties will also share early clinical development activities for certain selected targets, with Sarepta responsible for late stage development and commercialization of all targets . StrideBio received up-front consideration of $ 46.9 million, of which $ 29.4 million was in the form of Sarepta common stock and the balance in cash. In addition, StrideBio will receive significant future development, regulatory and commercial milestones upon the achievement of specified milestone events for each of the four programs. StrideBio will also receive royalties on worldwide net sales of any commercial products developed through the collaboration. Sarepta has also obtained an exclusive option to expand the collaboration to include up to an additional four targets with an up-front option payment of up to $42.5 million along with future downstream milestone and royalty payments, while StrideBio has an option to obtain co-development and co-commercial rights in the U.S. to one of the collaboration targets. In addition, Sarepta has made a commitment to invest in StrideBio’s next financing round that meets certain conditions . Patents and Proprietary Rights Our success depends in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain exclusivity for our products, product candidates and platform technologies. We typically rely on a combination of patent protection and regulatory exclusivity to maintain exclusivity for our products and product candidates, whereas exclusivity for our platform technologies is generally based on patent protection and trade secret protection. In addition to patent protection, regulatory exclusivity, and trade secret protection, we also protect our products, product candidates and platform technologies with copyrights, trademarks, and contractual protections. We actively seek patent protection for our product candidates and certain of our proprietary technologies by filing patent applications in the U.S. and other countries as appropriate. These patent applications are directed to various inventions, including, but not limited to, active ingredients, pharmaceutical formulations, methods of use, and manufacturing methods. In addition, we actively acquire exclusive rights to third party patents and patent applications to protect our in-licensed product candidates and corresponding platform technologies. We do not have patents or patent applications in every jurisdiction where there is a potential commercial market for our product candidates. For each of our programs, our decision to seek patent protection in specific foreign markets, in addition to the U.S., is based on many factors, including: • our available resources; • the number and types of patents already filed or pending; • the likelihood of success of the product candidate; • the size of the commercial market; • the presence of a potential competitor in the market; and • whether the legal authorities in the market effectively enforce patent rights. We continually evaluate our patent portfolio and patent strategy and believe our owned and licensed patents and patent applications provide us with a competitive advantage; however, if markets where we do not have patents or patent applications become commercially important, our business may be adversely affected. A discussion of certain risks and uncertainties that may affect our patent position, regulatory exclusivities and other proprietary rights is set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors included in this report, and a discussion of legal proceedings related to the key patents protecting our products and product candidates are set forth below in the footnotes to the tables in this section. Certain of our product candidates are in therapeutic areas that have been the subject of many years of extensive research and development by academic organizations and third parties who may control patents or other intellectual property that they might assert against us, should one or more of our product candidates in these therapeutic areas succeed in obtaining regulatory approval and thereafter be commercialized. We continually evaluate the intellectual property rights of others in these areas in order to determine whether a claim of infringement may be made by others against us. Should we determine that a third party has intellectual property rights that could impact our ability to freely market a compound, we consider a number of factors in determining how best to prepare for the commercialization of any such product candidate. In making this determination we consider, among other things, the stage of development of our product candidate, the anticipated date of first regulatory approval, whether we believe the intellectual property rights of others are valid, whether we believe we infringe the intellectual property rights of others, whether a license is available upon commercially reasonable terms, whether we will seek to challenge the intellectual property rights of others, the term of the rights, and the likelihood of and liability resulting from an adverse outcome should we be found to infringe the intellectual property rights of others. -16- Currently, U.S. patents, as well as most foreign patents, are generally effective for 20 years from the date the earliest regular application was filed. In some countries, the patent term may be extended to recapture a portion of the term lost during regulatory review of the claimed therapeutic. For example, in the U.S., under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may be eligible for patent term extension (for up to 5 years, but not beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval) as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. In the U.S., only one patent may be extended for any product based on FDA delay. In addition to patent term extension, patents in the U.S. may be granted additional term due to delays at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ( “ USPTO ” ) during prosecution of a patent application. We actively strive to maximize the potential for patent protection for our product s and product candidates in accordance with the law. Key Patents & Regulatory Exclusivities Our products, product candidates and our technologies are primarily protected by composition of matter and methods of use patents and patent applications. A summary of granted composition of matter and/or methods of use patents that we own or control in the U.S. and Europe, which cover our products and late-stage clinical product candidates, is provided below. To the extent the product or product candidate indicated above the tables that immediately follow the name of such product is covered by a patent that is licensed to Sarepta, we may owe milestones and/or royalties to the indicated licensor in connection with the development and/or commercial sale of the product or product candidate.

The various types of regulatory exclusivity for which our products have been granted and our product candidates are anticipated to be eligible to receive are generally discussed below, under ‘Government Regulation’ – ‘Data and Market Exclusivities’ and ‘Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity’. In connection with its FDA approval on February 25, 2021, the FDA granted AMONDYS 45 (casimersen) NCE exclusivity until February 25, 2026, and Orphan Drug Exclusivity until February 25, 2028. In addition to the foregoing composition of matter and method of use patents that protect eteplirsen, casimersen and golodirsen, we either solely own or exclusively license from UWA, BioMarin or AZL patents and patent applications in the U.S. and in major foreign markets that provide additional protection for eteplirsen, casimersen, and golodirsen, which cover the composition of matter, preparation and/or uses of the products and product candidates. These patents, and patent applications, if granted, would expire through at least 2038, such expiration dates not accounting for any patent term extension, patent term adjustment, supplemental protection certificate or pediatric extensions that may be available. Platform Technologies We separately own patents and patent applications in the U.S. and in major foreign markets that cover our proprietary PMO-based platform technologies (e.g., PPMO, PMOplus, PMO-X). These patents, and patent applications, if granted, expire through at least 2038, such expiration dates not accounting for any patent term extension, supplemental protection certificate or pediatric extensions that may be available. Trademarks Our trademarks are important to us and are generally filed to protect our corporate brand, our products and platform technologies. We typically file trademark applications and pursue their registration in the U.S., Europe and other markets in which we anticipate using such trademarks. We are the owner of multiple federal trademark registrations in the U.S. including, but not limited to, Sarepta, Sarepta Therapeutics, the double-helix logo, EXONDYS, EXONDYS 51, the EXONDYS 51 Logo, VYONDYS, VYONDYS 53, and the VYONDYS 53 Logo. In addition, we have multiple pending trademark applications in the U.S. and in major foreign markets, including, but not limited to, AMONDYS, AMONDYS 45, and the AMONDYS 45 Logo. Trademark protection varies in accordance with local law, and continues in some countries as long as the trademark is used and in other countries as long as the trademark is registered. Trademark registrations generally are for fixed but renewable terms. Government Regulation The testing, manufacturing, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, exportation and marketing of our products are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S. and in other countries. In the U.S., the FDA, under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations, regulates pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending marketing applications, withdrawal of approval of approved products, warning letters, untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, civil penalties and/or criminal prosecution. -19- U.S. Drug Approval Process To obtain FDA approval of a product candidate, we must, among other things, submit clinical data providing substantial evidence of safety and efficacy of the product for its intended use, as well as detailed information on product composition, its manufacture and controls and proposed labeling. The testing and collection of data and the preparation of necessary applications are expensive and time-consuming. The FDA may not act quickly or favorably in reviewing these applications, and we may encounter significant difficulties or costs in our efforts to obtain FDA approvals that could delay or preclude us from marketing our products. The steps required before a drug may be approved for marketing in the U.S. generally include the following: • pre-clinical laboratory tests and animal toxicity testing; • submission of an IND for conducting human clinical testing to the FDA, which must become effective before human clinical trials commence; • adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug product for each indication, including controlled studies or comparison of treated group from clinical trials to data from natural history data or studies; • submission of a complete and compliant marketing application containing chemistry, manufacturing and control information for the drug substance and drug product, reports of nonclinical and clinical trials, product labeling and administrative information; • satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the commercial manufacturing facilities at which the drug substance and drug product are made to assess compliance with cGMP; • satisfactory FDA audit of the clinical trial site(s) that generated the pivotal safety and efficacy data included in the marketing application and also potentially the nonclinical trial site(s) in the form of pre-approval inspections; and • FDA review and approval of the marketing application. Pre-clinical trials may include laboratory evaluations of the product chemistry, pharmacology, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the pharmacokinetics, metabolism, bio-distribution, elimination and toxicity of the product candidate. The conduct of the pre-clinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with federal regulations and requirements. The results of the pre-clinical trials, manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed first in human clinical trial protocol are submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may be initiated. The IND will become effective approximately 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions about the supportive data, or the study design, particularly regarding potential safety issues with conducting the clinical trial as described in the protocol. In this situation, the trials are placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns before clinical trials can proceed. Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patient participants under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the study, the administration of the investigational product, study procedures, parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as a submission to the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”) requirements and federal and state laws and regulations protecting study subjects. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) at or servicing each institution in which the clinical trial will be conducted. The IRB will consider, among other things, rationale for conducting the trial, clinical trial design, participant informed consent, ethical factors, the safety and rights of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution. The FDA can temporarily or permanently halt a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial subjects. The IRB may also require the clinical trial at a particular site be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with GCP or the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions. -20- Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential drug development phases (Phases 1, 2 and 3) prior to approval, and a portion of these phases may overlap. A fourth post-approval phase (Phase 4) may include additional clinical trial s. A general description of clinical trials conducted in each phase of development is provided below. However, the number of study subjects involved in each phase of drug development for rare diseases can be significantly less than typically expected for more common diseases with larger patient populations: • Phase 1. Phase 1 clinical trials involve the initial introduction of the drug into human subjects. These studies are usually designed to determine the safety of single and multiple doses of the compound and determine any dose limiting toxicities or intolerance, as well as the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of the drug in humans. Phase 1 studies usually involve less than 100 subjects and are conducted in healthy adult volunteers, unless it is unethical to administer the study drug to healthy volunteers, in which case they are tested in patients. • Phase 2. Phase 2 clinical trials are usually conducted in a limited patient population to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the drug for a specific indication to determine optimal dosage and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks. Phase 2 studies usually involve patients with the disease under investigation and may vary in size from several dozen to several hundred. • Phase 3. If an investigational drug is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in early phase studies, larger Phase 3 clinical trials are conducted to confirm clinical efficacy, dosage and safety in the intended patient population, which may involve geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials which establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for a specific indication are required for approval of a marketing application. Phase 3 studies usually include several hundred to several thousand patients for larger, non-orphan drug indications/diseases. However, clinical trials for rare or orphan diseases generally have fewer patients due to their lower prevalence. For these orphan diseases, a company may also try to demonstrate efficacy and safety by comparing treated patients in clinical trials to untreated patients participating in placebo-controlled clinical trials or to observational natural history studies. • Phase 4. Phase 4 trials are clinical trials conducted after the FDA has approved a product for marketing. Typically there are two forms of Phase 4 trials: those that are conducted to fulfill mandatory conditions of product approval and those that are voluntarily conducted to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. The mandatory studies are used to confirm clinical benefit in the case of drugs approved under the accelerated approval regulations or to provide additional clinical safety or efficacy data for “full” approvals. Failure to promptly conduct and complete mandatory Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval for products approved under accelerated approval regulations. A company seeking marketing approval for a new drug in the U.S. must submit the results of the pre-clinical and clinical trials to the FDA in the form of a marketing application, together with, among other things, detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product candidate and proposed labeling, including payment of a user fee for FDA review of the application. The user fee is waived for an application for a product intended to treat an Orphan Indication. The FDA assesses all submitted marketing applications for completeness before it accepts them for filing. In some cases, the FDA may request additional information before accepting a marketing application for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the marketing application. Applications receive either standard or priority review. Under the current goals mandated under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (the “PDUFA”), the FDA has ten months in which to complete its initial review of a standard marketing application and respond to the applicant, and six months for a priority marketing application. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard or priority marketing applications. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the marketing application sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date. The FDA may refer an application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. Though the FDA is not bound by such recommendations, it considers them carefully when making decisions. If the FDA’s evaluations of the marketing application and the clinical and manufacturing procedures and facilities are favorable, the FDA may issue an approval letter. If the FDA finds deficiencies in the marketing application, it may issue a complete response letter, which defines the conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the marketing application. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will issue an approval letter, authorizing commercial marketing of the drug. Sponsors that receive a complete response letter may submit to the FDA information that represents a complete response to the issues identified by the FDA. Resubmissions by the marketing application sponsor in response to a complete response letter trigger new review periods of varying length (typically two to six months) based on the content of the resubmission. If the FDA’s evaluation of the marketing application and the commercial manufacturing procedures and facilities is not favorable, the FDA may not approve the marketing application. -21- A sponsor may also seek designation of its drug candidates under programs designed to accelerate the FDA’s review and potential approval of marketing application s. For instance, a sponsor may seek FDA designation of a drug candidate as a “fast track product.” Fast track products are those products intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. If fast track designation is obtained, the FDA may initiate early and frequent communication an d begin reviewing sections of a marketing application before the application is complete. This “rolling review” is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the remaining information. Eteplirsen was granted fast track status in 2007. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (“FDASIA”) enacted and signed into law in 2012 amended the criteria for the fast track and accelerated approval pathways and, as a result, the pathways now share many common eligibility criteria. FDASIA provides both the sponsor companies and the FDA with greater flexibility and expedited regulatory mechanisms. The statute clarifies that a fast track product may be approved pursuant to an accelerated approval (Subpart – H) or under the traditional approval process. In addition, FDASIA codified the accelerated approval pathway as separate and apart from the fast track pathway, meaning that for drugs to be eligible for accelerated approval, they do not need to be designated under the fast track pathway. FDASIA reinforces the FDA’s authority to grant accelerated approval of a drug that treats a serious condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies and demonstrates an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality (“IMM”) that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit (i.e., an intermediate clinical endpoint). Approvals of this kind typically include requirements for appropriate post-approval Phase 4 clinical trials to confirm clinical benefit. FDASIA retains this requirement and further requires those studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. Additionally, FDASIA established a new, expedited regulatory mechanism referred to as breakthrough therapy designation. Breakthrough therapy designation, fast track, and accelerated approval are not mutually exclusive and are meant to serve different purposes. The breakthrough therapy designation is focused on expediting the development and review process and by itself does not create an alternate ground for product approval. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of a drug candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the drug is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA issued guidance entitled “Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions––Drugs and Biologics” in May 2014. Finally, if a drug candidate demonstrates a significant benefit over existing therapy, it may be eligible for priority review, which means it will be reviewed within a six-month timeframe from the date a complete marketing application is accepted for filing. A Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (“RMAT”) designation is also designed to accelerate approval for regenerative advanced therapies such as our gene therapy product candidates, but the exact mechanisms have not yet been announced by FDA. We cannot be sure that any of our drug candidates will qualify for any of these expedited development, review and approval programs, or that, if a drug does qualify, that the product candidates will be approved, will be accepted as part of any such program or that the review time will be shorter than a standard review. Holders of an approved marketing application are required to: • report serious adverse drug reactions to the FDA; • submit annual and periodic reports summarizing product information and safety data; • comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling; • continue to have quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP after approval; and • conduct any post-marketing study designated as a required condition of the marketing application approval. The FDA periodically inspects the sponsor’s records related to safety reporting and/or manufacturing; this latter effort includes assessment of compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved marketing application, including withdrawal of the product from the market. -22- Foreign Regulatory Requirements We are pursuing regulatory approval of eteplirsen in jurisdictions outside of the U.S. In November 2016, we submitted a marketing authorization application (“MAA”) for eteplirsen to the EMA and the application was validated in December 2016. As we announced on June 1, 2018, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) within the EMA adopted a negative opinion for eteplirsen. In September 2018, the CHMP confirmed its negative opinion for eteplirsen, and the European Commission adopted the CHMP opinion in December 2018. During 2019, we sought follow-up EMA scientific advice for eteplirsen. Once data from our ongoing studies is available, we plan to evaluate future engagement with the EMA on potential next steps. We have initiated key activities in support of the potential launch of our products in the EU, such as building out commercial infrastructure and scaling-up manufacturing. As of the date of this Annual Report, EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53 and AMONDYS 45 have only been approved for sale and marketing in the U.S. by the FDA, and EXONDYS 51 has been approved in addition for sale and marketing in Israel by the Israeli Ministry of Health. Thus, in addition to regulations in the U.S., our business is subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Irrespective of whether it concerns an FDA approved or investigational drug, the commencement of clinical trials and the subsequent marketing of a drug product in foreign countries are subject to preliminary approvals from the corresponding regulatory authorities of such countries. For example, the conduct of clinical trials in the EU is currently still governed by the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC laying down the requirements for the conduct of clinical trials in the EU and the principles and guidelines on GCP. Both Directives provide a system for the approval of clinical trials, which has been implemented through national legislation in the member states of the EU (“EU Member States”). Under this system, a sponsor must obtain approval from the competent national authority of an EU Member State in which the clinical trial is to be conducted, or in multiple EU Member States if the clinical trial is to be conducted in a number of countries. Furthermore, the sponsor may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. The Clinical Trials Application (“CTA”) must include the supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC, corresponding national laws of the EU Member States, and as further detailed in the applicable guidance documents. In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. Although the new Clinical Trials Regulation has been adopted and has entered into force in 2014, it will only come into application in the EU Member States six months after the European Commission has confirmed the functionality of the new Clinical Trials Information System (“CTIS”), which is the centralized EU portal and database for clinical trials introduced by the Regulation. The Regulation is currently expected to enter into application mid-2021. When the Regulation enters into application, it will repeal the currently applicable Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and its national implementation legislations. It will also apply to clinical trials that were authorized under the previous legislation if they are still ongoing three years after the Regulation has come into operation. No legislation needs to be adopted to implement the new Regulation into national EU Member State law. The new Regulation provides an overhaul of the system, in order to harmonize the assessment of the submission and assessment of clinical trials conducted in EU Member States and to ensure greater consistency with the highest standards of patient safety in the EU. Specifically, the new legislation seeks to simplify and streamline approval of the clinical trials. Under the new coordinated procedure, the sponsor of a clinical trial is required to submit a single application to a reporting EU Member State. The reporting EU Member State will consult and coordinate with all other EU Member States in which the clinical trial is planned to be conducted. If the application is rejected, it can be amended and resubmitted through CTIS, the central EU portal. If an approval is issued, the sponsor can start the clinical trial in all EU Member States concerned. However, a EU Member State can in certain cases declare an “opt-out” from the approval. In such a case, the clinical trial cannot be conducted in such EU Member State(s). The Clinical Trials Regulation also aims to streamline and simplify the rules on safety reporting for clinical trials. In order to obtain marketing authorization for a medicinal product in the EU, applicants are required to submit a MAA to either (a) the national competent authorities (through the decentralized, mutual recognition, or national procedures) or (b) the EMA (through the centralized authorization procedure). Applicants are required to demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicinal product in the application for marketing authorization, which implies the requirement to conduct human clinical trials to generate the necessary clinical data. Furthermore, all applications for marketing authorization for new medicines have to include the results of studies as described in an agreed pediatric investigation plan (“PIP”) aimed at ensuring that the necessary data are obtained through studies in children, unless the medicine is exempt because of a deferral or waiver. Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down the rules applicable to the centralized procedure for the authorization of medicinal products. The centralized procedure allows pharmaceutical companies to submit a single application to the EMA, which is followed by a single evaluation and which results in a single approval to market the medicinal product throughout the European Economic Area (the “EEA”), on the basis of a single market authorization. Approval via the centralized procedure is a two-step process whereby the CHMP first evaluates the MAA and issues an opinion on whether the medicinal product may be authorized or not (step 1). The CHMP opinion is subsequently sent to the European Commission (“EC”), which takes a legally binding decision to grant a marketing authorization (step 2). The marketing authorization is valid throughout the EU and is automatically recognized in three of the four European Free Trade Association states (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). This allows the marketing authorization holder to market the medicine and make it available throughout the EEA. The timeframe for the first step of the centralized procedure (evaluation by the CHMP) opinion is 210 days from receipt of a valid application. However, the actual time needed to complete this first step is generally longer than the 210 days, since procedural clock stops are required in order for the applicant to respond to additional requests for information by the CHMP. Following a positive CHMP opinion, the EC has 67 days to issue its decision to grant the marketing authorization or not. -23- Accelerated evaluation of the MAA is possible in exceptional cases, following a justified request from the applicant, when a medicinal product is of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The CHMP determines what constitutes a major public interest on a case-by-case basis. Justifications must include the major benefits expected and present the arguments to support the claim that the medicinal product introduces new methods of therapy or improves on existing methods, thereby addressing, to a significant extent, the greater unmet needs for maintaining and improving public health. In case of an accelerated assessment, the timeframe for review of a MAA by the EMA’s CHMP is reduced to 150 days. The timeframe for the EC to issue its decision remains unaltered. Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 defines in which cases the centralized application procedure must (mandatory scope) or may (optional scope) be followed. The centralized procedure is mandatory for medicinal products derived from biotechnological and other high-tech processes, orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy medicinal products and products indicated for the treatment of HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions, viral diseases and neurodegenerative diseases. For medicinal products that do not fall under any of the aforementioned categories, a submission via the centralized procedure is possible, provided that it concerns (i) a new active substance or (ii) product that can demonstrate a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation and for which approval would be in the interest of public health. Given the foregoing, our portfolio of innovative orphan products for neurodegenerative diseases is subject to the mandatory centralized procedure. Innovative medicinal products which have been authorized in accordance with the centralized procedure, benefit from an eight-year period of data protection/exclusivity and a ten-year period of marketing protection/exclusivity. During the data exclusivity period, applicants for approval of generics of these innovative products cannot reference or rely upon data contained in the marketing authorization dossier submitted for the innovative medicinal product. Furthermore, the marketing protection entails that even if the generic product is approved, it cannot be placed on the market until the full ten-year period of market protection has elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference medicinal product. The marketing protection period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder for the innovative product obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Similar to the U.S., marketing authorization holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA and/or the national competent authorities of the EU Member States. This oversight applies both before and after the granting of manufacturing and marketing authorizations. It includes compliance with EU GMP and GDP rules in relation to such activities as distribution, importing and exporting of medicinal products, rules governing conduct of pharmacovigilance (including good pharmacovigilance practices (“GVP”)) and requirements governing advertising, promotion and sale of medicinal products. Failure to comply with the EU Member State laws implementing the EU Community Code on medicinal products, and EU rules governing the promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices, with the EU Member State laws that apply to the promotion of medicinal products, statutory health insurance, bribery and anti-corruption or with other applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the relevant EU Member State authorities. This may include any of the following sanctions: fines, imprisonment, orders forfeiting products or prohibiting or suspending their supply to the market, orders to suspend, vary, or withdraw the marketing authorization or requiring the manufacturer to issue public warnings, or to conduct a product recall. The approval process in other countries outside the U.S. and the EU varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for the FDA approval. In addition, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement for market access vary greatly from country to country. In all cases, clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. Data and Market Exclusivities In addition to patent exclusivities, the FDA and certain other foreign health authorities may grant data or market exclusivity for a newly approved chemical entity or biologic, which runs in parallel to any patent protection. Regulatory data protection or exclusivity prevents a potential generic competitor from relying on clinical trial data generated by the sponsor when establishing the safety and efficacy of its competing product. Market exclusivity prohibits any marketing of the same drug for the same indication. -24- In the U.S., the FDA will generally grant a n NCE that is the subject of a n NDA with five years of regulatory data exclusivity, during which time a competitor generally may not submit an application to the FDA based on a sponsor’s clinical data. A competitor, however, may file an Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”) seeking approval of a generic drug four years from the date of approval of the innovative product if it is accompanied by a so-called Paragraph IV certification . For a newly approved biologic that is the subject of a Biologics License Application (“ BLA ”) , the FDA will generally grant 12 years of market exclusivity, during which time a competitor may not market the same drug for the same indication. In addition, the FDA may provide six months of pediatric exclusivity to a sponsor of a marketing application if the sponsor conducted a pediatric study or studies of a product. This process is applied to products developed for adult use and is initiated by the FDA as a written request for pediatric studies that applies to a sponsor’s product. If the sponsor conducts qualifying studies and the studies are accepted by the FDA, then an additional six months of pediatric exclusivity will be added to previously granted exclusivity, such as orphan drug exclusivity and NCE exclusivity, as well as certain patent-based exclusivities. Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity In the U.S., the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that drug. An orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. An orphan drug designation does not shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. The approval of an orphan designation request does not alter the regulatory requirements and process for obtaining marketing approval. Safety and efficacy of a compound must be established through adequate and well-controlled studies. If a chemical or biological product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives FDA approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is generally entitled to an orphan drug exclusivity period of seven years, which means the FDA may not grant approval to any other application to market the same chemical or biological product for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as where an alternative product demonstrates clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. In addition, holders of exclusivity for orphan drugs are expected to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of their orphan drugs to meet the needs of patients. Failure to do so could result in the withdrawal of orphan exclusivity for the drug. Competitors may receive approval of different drugs or biologics for the indications for which a prior approved orphan drug has exclusivity. Pharmaceutical companies can apply for the designation as an orphan medicine. In the EU, applications for orphan designation are evaluated by the EMA in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 141/2000. In order to qualify as an orphan medicine, the medicinal product must be intended to diagnose, prevent or treat a condition that is life-threatening or chronically debilitating, with a prevalence of no more than 5 in 10,000 people in the EU or for which it is unlikely that its sale would generate sufficient returns to justify the investment needed for its development. In addition, the sponsor is required to demonstrate that no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition has been be authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the medicinal product is of significant benefit to those affected by the condition as compared to approved methods. The benefits of being granted orphan designation are significant, including up to ten years of market exclusivity. During this ten-year period, the EMA may not accept a new marketing application for a similar medicinal product for the same therapeutic indication as the approved orphan medicinal product. Pursuant to Regulation (EC) 1901/2006 on medicinal products for pediatric use, the ten-year orphan market exclusivity can be extended to a maximum period of twelve years upon the satisfactory completion of all the key elements of the agreed PIP. We have been granted orphan drug designation for eteplirsen in the EU. Expanded / Early Access In certain countries, drug products approved in the U.S. or the EU can be accessed by patients before the drug has obtained marketing approval in such country. There are various forms of this access including, but not limited to, the actual purchase of product by the purchaser, which is often times the government for patients, on a named patient basis, and providing the product free of charge on a named patient basis for compassionate use. Each country has its own laws and regulations that apply to these forms of access and the extent and nature of such laws and regulations vary by country. For example, in 2018, the so-called Right to Try Act became law in the U.S. The law, among other things, allows eligible patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to such eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act. We established a global EAP for eteplirsen and golodirsen in some countries where eteplirsen and golodirsen currently have not been approved. The EAP provides a mechanism through which physicians can prescribe our products, within their professional responsibility, to patients who meet pre-specified medical and other criteria and can secure funding. -25- Other Regulatory Requirements In addition to regulations enforced by the FDA and foreign authorities relating to the clinical development and marketing of products, we are or may become subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and potential future foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations. Although we believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws that apply to us, we cannot predict whether new regulatory restrictions will be imposed by state or federal regulators and agencies or whether existing laws and regulations will adversely affect us in the future. Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws We are subject to various federal, state and local laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, including anti-kickback and false claims laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by crime or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, and/or exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). Federal and state authorities are paying increased attention to enforcement of these laws within the pharmaceutical industry, and private individuals have been active in alleging violations of the laws and bringing suits on behalf of the government under the federal False Claims Act (“FCA”). Violations of international fraud and abuse laws could result in similar penalties, including exclusion from participation in health programs outside the U.S. Given the broad scope of these laws, our activities could be subject to scrutiny under the laws. If we were subject to allegations concerning, or were convicted of violating, these laws, our business could be harmed. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute generally prohibits, among other things, a pharmaceutical manufacturer from directly or indirectly soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying any remuneration in cash or in kind where one purpose is either to induce the referral of an individual for, or the purchase or prescription of, a particular drug that is payable by a federal health care program, including Medicare or Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or a specific intent to violate the statute. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute can result in exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs as well as civil and criminal fines and penalties of up to $104,330 per violation and three times the amount of the unlawful remuneration. A claim arising from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute also constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. A new federal anti-kickback statute enacted in 2018 prohibits certain payments related to referrals of patients to certain providers (such as clinical laboratories) and applies to services reimbursed by private health plans as well as government health care programs. Federal and state false claims laws generally prohibit anyone from knowingly and willfully, among other activities, presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for drugs or services that are false or fraudulent (which may include claims for services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary services). False or fraudulent claims for purposes of the FCA carry fines and civil penalties for violations ranging from $11,665 to $23,331 for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages sustained by the federal government and, may provide the basis for exclusion from federally funded healthcare programs. There is also a criminal FCA statute by which individuals or entities that submit false claims can face criminal penalties. In addition, under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General has the authority to exclude from participation in federal health care programs or to impose civil penalties against any person who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, certain false or otherwise improper claims. A federal healthcare fraud statute prohibits the knowing and willful execution, or attempt to execute, a scheme to defraud a health care benefit program, including private health plans, or obtain, through false or fraudulent pretenses, money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, such a health care benefit program. The majority of states also have anti-kickback, false claims, and similar fraud and abuse laws and although the specific provisions of these laws vary, their scope is generally broad, and there may not be regulations, guidance or court decisions that apply the laws to particular industry practices. Laws and regulations have also been enacted by the federal government and various states to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers. The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers; require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government; and/or require disclosure to the government and/or public of financial interactions (so-called “sunshine laws”). State laws may also require disclosure of pharmaceutical pricing information and marketing expenditures. Manufacturers must also submit information to the FDA on the identity and quantity of drug samples requested and distributed by a manufacturer during each year. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our activities could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent federal and state laws and regulations. -26- Data Privacy and Security We may be subject to privacy and security laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate, obtain or store personally identifiable information. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business. Our ongoing efforts to comply with evolving laws and regulations may be costly and require ongoing modifications to our policies, procedures and systems. Failure to comply with laws regarding data protection would expose us to risk of enforcement actions and penalties under such laws. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. Within the U.S., there are numerous federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of personal information. For example, at the federal level, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as amended, and its implementing regulations establish privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information, or protected health information, and require the implementation of administrative, physical and technological safeguards to protect the privacy of protected health information. While we have determined that we are neither a “covered entity” nor a “business associate” directly subject to HIPAA, many of the U.S. health care providers with which we interact are subject to HIPAA, and we may have assumed obligations related to protecting the privacy of personal information. States are increasingly regulating the privacy and security of personal information. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which took effect on January 1, 2020, gives California consumers (defined to include all California residents) certain rights, including the right to ask covered companies to disclose the types of personal information collected, the categories of sources from which such information was collected, the business purpose for collecting or selling the consumer’s personal information, the categories of third parties with whom a covered company shares personal information, and specific pieces of information collected by a covered company. The CCPA imposes several obligations on covered companies to provide notice to California consumers regarding their data processing activities. The CCPA also gives California consumers the right to ask covered companies to delete a consumer’s personal information and it places limitations on a covered company’s ability to sell personal information, including providing consumers a right to opt out of sales of their personal information. In addition, we may be subject to privacy and security laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate, obtain or store personally identifiable information. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business. For example, the processing of personal data in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), is subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), which took effect in May 2018. The GDPR increases obligations with respect to clinical trials conducted in the EEA, such as in relation to the provision of fair processing notices, responding to data subjects who exercise their rights and reporting certain data breaches to regulators and affected individuals. The GDPR also requires us to enter certain contractual arrangements with third parties that process GDPR-covered personal data on our behalf. The GDPR also increases the scrutiny applied to transfers of personal data from the EEA (including from clinical trial sites in the EEA) to countries that are considered by the European Commission to lack an adequate level of data protection, such as the United States. The July 2020 invalidation by the Court of Justice of the European Union of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework, one of the mechanisms used to legitimize the transfer of personal data from the EEA to the U.S., has led to increased scrutiny on data transfers from the EEA to the U.S. generally and may increase our costs of compliance with data privacy legislation. If our or our partners’ or service providers’ privacy or data security measures fail to comply with the GDPR requirements, we may be subject to litigation, regulatory investigations, enforcement notices requiring us to change the way we use personal data and/or fines of up to 20 million Euros or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, as well as claims by affected individuals, negative publicity, reputational harm and a potential loss of business and goodwill Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement We have an ongoing dialogue with payors globally with the goal of obtaining broad coverage for our products. To date, payors’ policies on coverage for our products have varied widely, including policies that allow broad coverage per the respective product’s prescribing information, policies that provide limited coverage and policies that have denied coverage. The majority of payors have policies that provide for case-by-case coverage or restricted coverage. Our revenue depends, in part, upon the extent to which payors provide coverage for our products and the amount that payors, including government authorities or programs, private health insurers and other organizations, reimburse patients and healthcare providers for the cost of our products. Third Party Reimbursement and Pricing in the U.S. Commercial Insurance. Coverage and reimbursement of our products vary from commercial payor to commercial payor. Many commercial payors, such as managed care plans, manage access to FDA approved products, and may use drug formularies and medical policies (which may include specific coverage requirements such as prior authorization, re-authorization and achieving performance metrics under value-based contracts) to control utilization. Exclusion from or restriction in coverage can reduce product usage. -27- Medicaid . Our products are eligible to be reimbursed by Medicaid . Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that is administered by the states for low income and disabled beneficiaries. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, participating manufacturers are required to pay a rebate for each unit of product reimbursed under the state Medicaid programs. The amount of the rebate for each product is set by law and depends in part on the prices at which our products are sold to certain other purchasers and may be subject to an additional discount if certain pricing increases more than inflation. State Medicaid programs and Medicaid managed care plans can seek additional “supplemental” rebates from manufacturers in connection with favorable positioning on formularies. Medicare . Medicare is a federal program that is administered by the federal government that covers individuals age 65 and over, disabled individuals and individuals with certain conditions. Our products are eligible for reimbursement under Medicare Part B. Medicare Part B generally covers drugs that are usually administered by physicians or other clinicians. Medicare Part B pays for such drugs under a payment methodology based on the average sales price (“ASP”) of the drugs. Reimbursement levels and reimbursement methodologies have come under scrutiny and may be subject to change. See “ Government Regulation – Healthcare and Other Reform. ” The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) are also increasingly bundling drug reimbursement into procedure costs, which can severely decrease the reimbursement rates for some manufacturers’ drugs. Federal Purchasers . Drug products are subject to discounted pricing when purchased by federal agencies via the Federal Supply Schedule (“FSS”). FSS participation is required for a drug product to be covered and reimbursed by certain federal agencies and for coverage under Medicaid, Medicare Part B and the Public Health Service (“PHS”) 340B drug pricing program. FSS pricing is negotiated periodically with the Department of Veterans Affairs. FSS pricing is intended not to exceed the price that a manufacturer charges its most-favored non-federal customer for its product. In addition, prices for drugs purchased by the Veterans Administration, Department of Defense (including drugs purchased by military personnel and dependents through the TRICARE retail pharmacy program), Coast Guard, and PHS are subject to a cap on pricing (known as the “federal ceiling price”) and may be subject to an additional discount if pricing increases more than the rate of inflation. PHS 340B Drug Pricing Program . To maintain coverage of drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and Medicare Part B, manufacturers are required to extend discounts to certain purchasers under the PHS 340B drug pricing program. Purchasers eligible for discounts include hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of financially needy patients, community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the PHS. Healthcare and Other Reform. In the U.S., federal and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reform delivery of, or payment for, health care, which include initiatives to reduce the cost of healthcare. For example, in March 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (the “Healthcare Reform Act”), which expanded health care coverage through Medicaid expansion, implemented the “individual mandate” for health insurance coverage (by imposing a tax penalty on individuals who did not obtain insurance) and changed the coverage and reimbursement of drug products under government healthcare programs. Under the Trump administration, there have been ongoing efforts to modify or repeal all or certain provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act. Tax reform legislation was enacted at the end of 2017 that includes provisions that will affect healthcare insurance coverage and payment, such as the elimination of the tax penalty for individuals who do not maintain sufficient health insurance coverage. The Healthcare Reform Act has also been subject to judicial challenge. In December 2018, a federal district court judge, in a challenge brought by a number of state attorneys general, found the Healthcare Reform Act unconstitutional in its entirety because once Congress repealed the “individual mandate” provision, there was no longer a basis to rely on Congressional taxing authority to support enactment of the law. The court reasoned that the “individual mandate” was not severable from the rest of the Healthcare Reform Act and found the entire Healthcare Reform Act was an unconstitutional exercise of Congressional authority. The case Texas v. Azar, which challenges the constitutionality of the Healthcare Reform Act, including provisions that are unrelated to healthcare reform but were enacted as part of the Healthcare Reform Act, was argued before the Supreme Court in November 2020. Pending resolution of the litigation, all of the Healthcare Reform Act but the individual mandate to buy health insurance remains in effect. Beyond the Healthcare Reform Act, there have been ongoing health care reform efforts, including a number of recent actions. In 2020 and early 2021, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has issued various rules that affect pricing or payment for drug products. For example, effective January 2022, revisions to the federal anti-kickback statute would remove protection for traditional Medicare Part D discounts offered by pharmaceutical manufacturers to PBMs and health plans. Additional healthcare reform efforts have sought to address certain issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including an expansion of telehealth coverage under Medicare and accelerated or advanced Medicare payments to healthcare providers. Some of these changes have been and may continue to be subject to legal challenge. For example, courts have temporarily enjoined a new “most favored nation” payment model for select drugs covered under Medicare Part B that was to take effect on January 1, 2021 and would limit payment based on international drug price. The nature and scope of health care reform in the wake of the transition from the Trump administration to the Biden administration remains uncertain, although President Biden supported reforms to lower drug prices during his campaign for the presidency. Adoption of new healthcare reform legislation at the federal or state level could affect demand for, or pricing of, our products or product candidates if approved for sale. We cannot predict, however, the ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or action, or its impact on us, and healthcare reform could increase compliance costs and may adversely affect our future business and financial results. -28- There have also been efforts by government officials or legislators to implement measures to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products, including legislation on drug importation. Recently, there has been considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing and proposals to address the perceived high cost of pharmaceuticals. There have also been recent state legislative efforts to address drug costs, which generally have focused on increasing transparency around drug costs or limiting drug prices. Certain state legislation has been subject to legal challenges. Adoption of new legislation regulating drug pricing at the federal or state level could further affect demand for, or pricing of, our products. General legislative cost control measures may also affect reimbursement for our products. The Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended, resulted in the imposition of 2% reductions in Medicare (but not Medicaid) payments to providers in 2013 and remains in effect through 2030 (except May 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021) unless additional Congressional action is taken. Any significant spending reductions affecting Medicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented and/or any significant taxes or fees that may be imposed on us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Third Party Reimbursement and Pricing outside the U.S. We currently have no products approved for marketing outside the U.S., other than a marketing authorization for EXONDYS 51 in Israel. We may need to conduct long-term pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. In the EU and certain other territories, price controls and Health Technology Assessments for new, highly priced medicines are expected. Uncertainty exists about the pricing and reimbursement status of newly approved products in the EU. Criteria such as cost-effectiveness, cost per quality-adjusted life year, budget impact, or others, in addition to the clinical benefit, are often required to demonstrate added value or benefit of a drug and vary by country. Third party reimbursement limits may reduce the demand for our products. The pace of the application process in some countries could also delay commercial product launches. Gaining acceptance of our product pipeline and an economically viable reimbursement terms in the EU and other markets will require strong education and awareness efforts around DMD as well as strong data supporting its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Competition The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive, and any product candidate developed by us would likely compete with existing drugs and therapies. There are many pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, public and private universities, government agencies and research organizations that compete with us in developing various approaches to the treatment of rare, neuromuscular and other diseases. Many of these organizations have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing and marketing resources than we have. Several of them have developed or are developing therapies that could be used for treatment of the same diseases that we are targeting. In addition, some of these competitors have significantly greater commercial infrastructures than we have. Our ability to compete successfully will depend largely on: • our ability to complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates; • the efficacy, safety and reliability of our products and product candidates; • the dosing, strength, convenience and other product profile attributes of our products and product candidates; • the timing and scope of regulatory approvals; • product acceptance by physicians and other health-care providers; • protection of our proprietary rights and the level of generic competition; • the ability to have freedom to operate to commercialize our products and product candidates; • the speed at which we develop product candidates; • our ability to supply commercial quantities of a product meeting FDA specifications to the market; • obtaining reimbursement for product use in approved indications; • our ability to recruit and retain skilled employees; and • the availability of substantial capital resources to fund development and commercialization activities, including the availability of funding from the U.S. government. EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53 and AMONDYS 45 were the first three disease modifying therapeutics approved by FDA for the treatment of DMD for patients with a confirmed mutation that is amenable to exon 51 skipping, exon 53 skipping or exon 45 skipping, respectively. However, in the field of DMD alone, these products and those in our pipeline face a variety of competitors who either have FDA approval or are being clinically developed for the treatment of DMD. In addition, there are many companies who have announced plans to transition pre-clinical candidates to clinical development for the treatment of DMD. While we are uniquely positioned to be pursuing disease-modifying therapies for DMD based on our RNA, gene therapy and gene editing platforms, our competitors may also pursue therapies based on any or all of the platforms or modalities that are competitive with ours. The following paragraphs summarize some of these competitors of interest that have disease-modifying therapeutics commercially available or in clinical development. -29- Nippon Shinyaku Co. Ltd. (“Nippon”) has an exon 53 skipping candidate, VILTEPSO (viltolarsen) (codenamed: NS-065/NCNP-01), that is a morpholino based oligonucleotide. On March 25, 2020, Nippon announced that the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare (“MHLW”) has approved Viltepso Intravenous Infusion 250 mg (viltolarsen) for the treatment of patients with DMD who are amendable to exon 53 skipping therapy making it the first regulatory approval for viltolarsen in the world and the first non-steroidal treatment for DMD approved in Japan. Nippon further announced on August 13, 2020 that the FDA approved VILTEPSO (viltolarsen) injection for patients with DMD who are amenable to exon 53 skipping therapy. Nippon has announced plans to pursue global registration for viltolarsen. Wave Life Sciences (“Wave”) is developing oligonucleotides for the treatment of DMD. It was developing an exon 51 skipping product candidate for DMD, suvodirsen (WVE-210201) until on December 16, 2019, Wave announced the discontinuation of suvodirsen development for DMD (exon 51 amenable patients). Wave more recently reported its intent to develop an exon 53 skipping product candidate, WVE-N531, with plans to submit a CTA in 2021. Daiichi Sankyo (“Daiichi”) has reported a phase 1/2 clinical trial conducted in Japan for its exon 45 skipping oligonucleotide candidate, DS-5141b. In April 2018, Daiichi announced top-line results of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial of DS-5141 and that Daiichi will continue to develop DS-5141b. Daiichi is sponsoring a Phase 2 clinical trial of DS-5141b. Solid Biosciences, LLC (“Solid”) has reported that its micro-dystrophin gene transfer product candidate for DMD, SGT-001 began a Phase 2 clinical study (“IGNITE DMD”) in December 2017. SGT-001 was granted fast track designation by the FDA in October 2018, orphan drug designation in August 2016, and rare pediatric disease designation in 2017. In Europe, orphan designation was granted in September 2016. In February 2019, Solid reported micro-dystrophin expression data for the first three patients in its clinical trial and announced plans to continue the study at a higher dose pending FDA and IRB approval. Solid announced on January 9, 2020 that in response to the FDA placing the SGT-001 IGNITE DMD trial on clinical hold, previously announced in November 2019, it is conducting its analyses of SGT-001 to determine how to address the clinical hold and resume dosing. Solid recently announced that it has been cleared to resume dosing in its IGNITE DMD clinical trial. Pfizer Inc. (“Pfizer”), following its acquisition of Bamboo Therapeutics, Inc., initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial in January 2018 to test the safety and tolerability of its AAV-9 / mini-dystrophin gene transfer product candidate for DMD, PF-06939926/BMB-D001. The related orphan designation was granted in Europe in August 2016, and in the U.S. in May 2017. Rare pediatric disease designation was granted by the FDA in April 2018. In June 2019, Pfizer presented initial Phase 1b clinical data on PF-06939926. In January 2021, Pfizer announced the first dose of its Phase 3 CIFFREO study that will evaluate the efficacy and safety of PF-06939926 in boys with DMD. There are several companies in addition to those mentioned above that are pursuing disease modifying programs for DMD that are at the pre-clinical stage. These companies are pursuing oligonucleotides, gene transfer therapy or gene editing. Some of these pre-clinical approaches have been announced by BioMarin, Ultragenyx, Dyne Therapeutics, Avidity, Regenxbio, Astellas and Exonics (Vertex). Other companies continue to pursue development and approval of products for the treatment of DMD and their products may or may not prove to be safer and/or more efficacious than the products and product candidates in our DMD pipeline. Regarding any of these competitors, it is unknown if clinical development of these or other compounds is planned or would be continued. Additionally, companies such as Santhera, PTC Therapeutics, Fibrogen, ReveraGen, Capricor Therapeutics, BioPhytis, Mallinckrodt, and Antisense Therapeutics have product candidates with mechanisms of action distinct from ours in different stages of development or approval in DMD which we believe could be seen as complementary to exon skipping and not a direct replacement of our products or product candidates at this time. In addition, several companies and institutions have recently entered into collaborations or other agreements for the development of product candidates, including mRNA, gene (CRISPR, AAV, etc.) or small molecule therapies that are potential competitors to therapies being developed by us in the muscular dystrophy, neuromuscular, CNS and rare disease space, including but not limited to Audentes (now Astella), Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, 4D Molecular Therapeutics, Biogen Inc., Ionis, Synthena AG, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Sanofi, Takeda, Roche, Novartis, Eli Lilly, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Moderna Therapeutics, Inc., Akashi, Oxford University, Exonics Therapeutics (acquired by Vertex Pharmaceuticals), CRISPR Therapeutics and Editas Medicine. Platform Technology Competition . We believe that other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies share a focus on RNA-targeted drug discovery and development. Competitors with respect to our RNA-targeted technologies include, but are not limited to, Alnylam, Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corp., Deciphera Pharmaceuticals, Ionis, BioMarin, Sanofi, Synthena AG, Roche Innovation Center Copenhagen (formerly Santaris Pharma A/S) , Shire plc (now Takeda), Nippon, Daiichi Sankyo, Moderna Therapeutics, Avidity, Dyne Therapeutics, Stoke Therapeutics and Wave. -30- Human Capital Resources Our urgent mission – to engineer precision genetic medicine for rare diseases that devastate lives and cut futures short – is dependent on our ability to attract, develop and retain the industry’s best and brightest talent across all dimensions of diversity. This understanding informs our approach to managing our human capital resources. General Information. As of December 31, 2020, we had 866 employees globally, 461 of whom hold advanced degrees. Of these employees, 494 are engaged directly in research and development activities and 372 are in selling and general and administration. None of our employees in the United States are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we consider relations with our employees to be good. Equity, diversity, and inclusion . We strive to promote diversity, inclusion and equal opportunity across the organization. In the area of gender diversity, representation of women has increased over the past several years: in 2017 and 2018, women made up 51% of our workforce, and in 2019, this percentage increased to 54%. As of December 31, 2020, women made up 55% of our workforce. The number of women in leadership positions has also consistently increased. In 2017, women represented 35% of the leadership positions at the Director level and above. This percentage increased to 36% in 2018, 44% in 2019 and 47% as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, women held 28.6% of the seats of our Board of Directors, including the Chair of the Board. Racial and ethnic diversity has also increased in the past few years, from 23% of our workforce being racially/ethnically diverse in 2017 and 2018, to 26% in 2019 and 29% as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, 44% of our Executive Committee, which represents the most senior leadership positions in the Company, is diverse based on gender and ethnicity. Compensation, Benefits and Ongoing Professional Development. We are committed to rewarding, supporting, and developing the employees who make it possible to deliver on our strategy. To that end, we offer a comprehensive total rewards package that includes market-competitive pay, broad-based equity grants and bonuses, healthcare benefits, pension and retirement savings plans, paid time off and family leave, caregiving support, fitness subsidies, tuition reimbursement and an Employee Assistance Program. We offer robust onsite learning opportunities for employees at every stage in their career, and in 2020 we launched ELEVATE – our leadership development program, the participants of which reflect ethnic, racial and gender diversity. In recognition of the new challenges the COVID-19 pandemic brought, we took various steps to support our employees, including by transitioning to remote work and by offering flexible schedule, childcare assistance and sessions focused on resilience and happiness in uncertain times. At the same time, we protected our facility-dependent employees, including those needed to maintain manufacturing and clinical research, by instituting strict protocols designed to ensure they remain healthy. General Corporate Information We were originally incorporated in the State of Oregon on July 22, 1980, and on June 6, 2013, we reincorporated in the State of Delaware. Our principal executive offices are located at 215 First Street, Suite 415, Cambridge, MA 02142 and our telephone number is (617) 274-4000. Our common stock is quoted on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “SRPT”. While we achieve revenue from our products in the U.S. and through distribution of eteplirsen, golodirsen and casimersen through our EAP outside the U.S., we are likely to continue to incur operating losses in the near term associated with our ongoing operations, research and development activities and potential business development activities. For more information about our revenues and operating losses, see Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $1,947.8 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments, consisting of $1,502.6 million of cash and cash equivalents, $435.9 million of short-term investments and $9.3 million of long-term restricted cash investments. We believe that our balance of cash, cash equivalents and investments is sufficient to fund our current operational plan for at least the next twelve months. In addition to pursuing additional cash resources through public or private financings, we may also seek to enter into contracts, including collaborations or licensing agreements with respect to our technologies, with third parties, including government entities. -31- Where You Can Find Additional Information We make available free of charge through our corporate website, www.sarepta.com , our annual reports, quarterly reports, current reports, proxy statements and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed or furnished with the SEC.

Set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC are descriptions of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report. Because of the following factors, as well as other variables affecting our operating results, past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also affect our results of operations and financial condition. Risks Related to Our Business We are highly dependent on the commercial success of our products in the U.S. We may not be able to meet expectations with respect to sales of our products or attain profitability and positive cash-flow from operations. The FDA granted accelerated approval for EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53 and AMONDYS 45, respectively, as therapeutic treatments for DMD in patients who have a confirmed mutation in the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 51, exon 53 and exon 45 skipping, respectively. EXONDYS 51 is currently commercially available in the U.S. and Israel only, and VYONDYS 53 and AMONDYS 45 are currently commercially available in the U.S. only, although they are available in additional countries through our EAP. The commercial success of our products continues to depend on a number of factors attributable to one of our products or the products of our competitors, including, but not limited to: • the effectiveness of our sales, managed markets, marketing efforts and support for our products; • the generation and dissemination of new data analyses and the consistency of any new data with prior results, whether they support a favorable safety, efficacy and effectiveness profile of our products and any potential impact on our FDA accelerated approval status and/or FDA package insert for our products; • the effectiveness of our ongoing commercialization activities, including negotiating and entering into any additional commercial, supply and distribution contracts, ongoing manufacturing efforts and hiring any additional personnel as needed to support commercial efforts; • our ability to timely comply with FDA post-marketing requirements and commitments, including through successfully conducting additional studies that confirm clinical efficacy, effectiveness and safety of our products and acceptance of the same by the FDA and medical community since continued approval may be contingent upon verification of a clinical benefit in confirmatory trials; • the occurrence of any side effects, adverse reactions or misuse, or any unfavorable publicity in these areas; • the generation of evidence describing payers, patients and/or societal value of our products; • whether we can consistently manufacture our products and product candidates at acceptable costs; -32- • the rate and consistency with which our products are prescribed by physicians, which depends on physicians’ views on the safety, effectiveness and efficacy of our products; • our ability to secure and maintain adequate reimbursement for our products, including the duration of the prior-authorization as well as the number and duration of re-authorization processes required for patients who initially obtained coverage by third parties, including by government payors, managed care organizations and private health insurers; • our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products, to preserve our trade secrets, to prevent third parties from infringing on our proprietary rights and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties; • the development, commercialization or pricing of competing products or therapies for the treatment of DMD, or its symptoms, and the existence of competing clinical trials; • our ability to increase awareness of the importance of genetic testing and knowing/understanding DMD mutations, and identifying and addressing procedural barriers to obtaining therapy; • our ability to remain compliant with laws and regulations that apply to us and our commercial activities; • the actual market-size, ability to identify patients and the demographics of patients eligible for our products, which may be different than expected; • the sufficiency of our drug supply to meet commercial and clinical demands and standards, which are negatively impacted by various factors, including when our projections on the potential number of amenable patients and their average weight are inaccurate; if regulatory requirements increase our drug supply needs; if our current drug supply is destroyed or negatively impacted at our manufacturing sites, storage sites or in transit; failure to meet cGMP requirements; or if we encounter delays expanding the number of patients on our products and portions of our products’ supply expire before sale; • our ability to obtain regulatory approvals to commercialize our product candidates, and to commercialize our products in markets outside of the U.S.; • the process leading to a patient’s first infusion of our products may be slower for certain patients. For example, the time to first infusion may take longer if a patient chooses to put in an intravenous port, which eases access to the vein. Delays in the process prior to first infusion could negatively impact the sales of our products; and • the exercise by Roche of its option to obtain an exclusive license to commercialize one or more of our DMD products beyond SRP-9001 outside of the U.S. and Roche’s subsequent commercialization efforts. In addition, the response to COVID-19 by healthcare providers has made it difficult for some patients to receive infusions or initiate treatment with our commercial products. For this and other reasons, such as delays in processing reauthorizations and modifications to program benefits by insurers, we expect that COVID-19 will reduce our revenue from commercial product sales. We experience significant fluctuations in sales of our products from period to period and, ultimately, we may never generate sufficient revenues from our products to reach or maintain profitability or sustain our anticipated levels of operations. Even though EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53 and AMONDYS 45 have received accelerated approval by the FDA, they face future post-approval development and regulatory requirements, which will present additional challenges we will need to successfully navigate. The accelerated approvals for EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53 and AMONDYS 45 granted by the FDA were based on an increase in the surrogate biomarker of dystrophin in skeletal muscles observed in some patients treated with these products. These products will be subject to ongoing FDA requirements governing labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping, and we are required to submit additional safety, efficacy and other post-marketing information to the FDA. Under the accelerated approval pathway, continued approval may be contingent upon verification of a clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. These post-approval requirements and commitments may not be feasible and/or could impose significant burdens and costs on us; could negatively impact our development, manufacturing and supply of our products; and could negatively impact our financial results. Failure to meet post-approval commitments and requirements, including completion of enrollment and in particular, any failure to obtain positive safety and efficacy data from our ongoing and planned studies of our products, would lead to negative regulatory action from the FDA and/or withdrawal of regulatory approval of EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53 or AMONDYS 45. -33- Manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP regulations. Drug product manufacturers are required to continuously monitor and report adverse events from clinical trials and commercial use of the product. If we or a regulatory agency discover previously unknown adverse events or events of unanticipated severity or frequency, a regulatory agency may require labeling changes , implementation of risk evaluation and mitigation strategy program, or additional post-marketing studies or clinical trials. If we or a regulatory agency discover previously unknown problems with a product, such as problems with a facility where the API or drug product is manufactured or tested, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product and/or the manufacturer, including removal of specific product lots from the market, withdrawal of the product from the market, suspension of manufacturing or suspension of clinical trials using the same manufacturing materials . Sponsors of drugs approved under FDA accelerated approval provisions also are required to submit to the FDA, at least 30 days before initial use, all promotional materials intended for use after the first 120 days following marketing approval. If we or the manufacturing facilities for our products fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may: • issue warning letters or untitled letters; • seek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines; • suspend or withdraw or alter the conditions of our marketing approval; • mandate modifications to promotional materials or require us to provide corrective information to healthcare practitioners; • suspend any ongoing clinical trials; • require us to enter into a consent decree, which can include imposition of various fines, reimbursements for inspection costs, required due dates for specific actions and penalties for noncompliance; • refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to applications submitted by us; • suspend or impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; • seize or detain products, refuse to permit the import or export of products or require us to initiate a product recall; or • refuse to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. We are subject to uncertainty relating to reimbursement policies which, if not favorable, could hinder or prevent the commercial success of our products and/or product candidates. Our ability to successfully maintain and/or increase sales of our products in the U.S. depends in part on the coverage and reimbursement levels set by governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors. Third party payors are increasingly challenging the effectiveness of and prices charged for medical products and services. We may not be able to obtain or maintain adequate third-party coverage or reimbursement for our products, and/or we may be required to provide discounts or rebates on our products in order to obtain or maintain adequate coverage. We expect that private insurers will continue to consider the efficacy, effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and safety of our products, including any new data and analyses that we are able to collect and make available in a compliant manner, in determining whether to approve reimbursement for our products and at what levels. If there are considerable delays in the generation of new evidence or if any new data and information we collect is not favorable, third party insurers may make coverage decisions that negatively impact sales of our products. We continue to have discussions with payors, some of which may eventually deny coverage. We may not receive approval for reimbursement of our products from additional insurers on a satisfactory rate or basis, in which case our business would be materially adversely affected. In addition, obtaining these approvals can be a time consuming and expensive process. Our business would be materially adversely affected if we are not able to maintain favorable coverage decisions and/or fail to receive additional favorable coverage decisions from third party insurers, in particular during re-authorization processes for patients that have already initiated therapy. Our business could also be adversely affected if government health programs, private health insurers, including managed care organizations, or other reimbursement bodies or payors limit the indications for which our products will be reimbursed or fail to recognize accelerated approval and surrogate endpoints as clinically meaningful. In addition, the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in delays in processing reauthorizations and modifications to program benefits by insurers, making it difficult for patients to obtain or maintain favorable coverage decisions for our products. Furthermore, we cannot predict to what extent the COVID-19 pandemic, depending on its scale and duration, may disrupt global healthcare systems and access to our products or result in a widespread loss of individual health insurance coverage due to unemployment, a shift from commercial payor coverage to government payor coverage, or an increase in demand for patient assistance and/or free drug programs, any of which would adversely affect access to our products and our net sales. -34- In some foreign countries, particularly Canada and the countries of Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to strict governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take 12 to 24 months or longer after the receipt of regulatory approval and product launch. In order to obtain favorable reimbursement for the indications sought or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to collect additional data, including conducting additional studies. Furthermore, several European countries have implemented government measures to either freeze or reduce pricing of pharmaceutical products. If reimbursement for our products is unavailable in any country in which reimbursement is sought, limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be materially harmed. In addition, many foreign countries are referencing to other countries’ official public list price, hence an unsatisfactory price level in one country could consequently impinge negatively upon overall revenue. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of our current and future products due to a number of factors, including current and future healthcare reforms and initiatives by government health programs and private insurers (including managed care plans) to reduce healthcare costs, the scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing, the ongoing debates on reducing government spending and additional legislative proposals. These healthcare reform efforts or any future legislation or regulatory actions aimed at controlling and reducing healthcare costs, including through measures designed to limit reimbursement, restrict access or impose unfavorable pricing modifications on pharmaceutical products, could impact our and our partners’ ability to obtain or maintain reimbursement for our products at satisfactory levels, or at all, which could materially harm our business and financial results. Additionally, our gene therapy product candidates represent novel approaches to treatment that will call for new levels of innovation in both pricing, reimbursement, payment and drug access strategies. Current reimbursement models may not accommodate the unique factors of our gene therapy product candidates, including high up-front costs, lack of long-term efficacy and safety data and fees associated with complex administration, dosing and patient monitoring requirements. Hence, it may be necessary to restructure approaches to payment, pricing strategies and traditional payment models to support these therapies. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. If we are unable to obtain adequate levels of reimbursement, our ability to successfully market and sell our products and product candidates will be harmed. The manner and level at which reimbursement is provided for services related to our products and product candidates (e.g., for administration of our products to patients) is also important. Inadequate reimbursement for such services may lead to physician resistance and limit our ability to market or sell our products. Healthcare reform and other governmental and private payor initiatives may have an adverse effect upon, and could prevent commercial success of our products and product candidates. The U.S. government and individual states have aggressively pursued healthcare reform, as evidenced by the passing of the Healthcare Reform Act and the ongoing efforts to modify or repeal that legislation. The Healthcare Reform Act substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and contains a number of provisions that affect coverage and reimbursement of drug products and/or that could potentially reduce the demand for pharmaceutical products such as increasing drug rebates under state Medicaid programs for brand name prescription drugs and extending those rebates to Medicaid managed care and assessing a fee on manufacturers and importers of brand name prescription drugs reimbursed under certain government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Other aspects of healthcare reform, such as expanded government enforcement authority and heightened standards that could increase compliance-related costs, could also affect our business. Under the Trump Administration, a number of actions were taken to modify or repeal prior health reform and to implement additional health reform. There are, and may continue to be, judicial challenges to those efforts. In addition, although President Biden supported reforms to lower drug prices during his campaign for presidency, the nature and scope of health reform action that may be taken under his administration remains uncertain. We cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any changes to the Healthcare Reform Act or other federal and state reform efforts. There is no assurance that federal or state health care reform will not adversely affect our future business and financial results, and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative, judicial or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, waiver from Medicaid drug rebate law requirements, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs and the introduction of international reference pricing in the U.S. We anticipate that the U.S. Congress, state legislatures and the private sector will continue to consider and may adopt healthcare policies intended to curb rising healthcare costs. These cost containment measures may include implementation or modification of: • controls on government funded reimbursement for drugs; • caps or mandatory discounts under certain government sponsored programs; • controls on healthcare providers; -35- • challenges to the pricing of drugs or limits or prohibitions on reimbursement for specific products through other means; • reform of drug importation laws; • delegation of decision making to state Medicaid agencies and waiver of reimbursement requirements; • expansion of use of managed care systems in which healthcare providers contract to provide comprehensive healthcare for a fixed cost per person; and • prohibition on direct-to-consumer advertising or drug marketing practices. We are unable to predict what additional legislation, regulations or policies, if any, relating to the healthcare industry or third party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future or what effect such legislation, regulations or policies would have on our business. Any cost containment measures, including those listed above, or other healthcare system reforms that are adopted, could significantly decrease the available coverage and the price we might establish for our products and product candidates, which would have an adverse effect on our net revenues and operating results. Our products may not be widely adopted by patients, payors or healthcare providers, which would adversely impact our potential profitability and future business prospects. The commercial success of our products, particularly in the near term in the U.S., depends upon the level of market adoption by patients, payors and healthcare providers. If our products do not achieve an adequate level of market adoption for any reason, or if market adoption does not persist, our potential profitability and our future business prospects will be severely adversely impacted. The degree of market acceptance of our products depends on a number of factors, including: • our ability to demonstrate to the medical and payor community, including specialists who may purchase or prescribe our products, the clinical efficacy, effectiveness and safety of our products as the prescription products of choice for their respective indications; • the effectiveness of our sales and marketing organizations and distribution networks; • the ability of patients or providers to be adequately reimbursed for our products in a timely manner from government and private payors; • the ability to timely demonstrate to the satisfaction of payors real world effectiveness and the economic, humanistic and societal benefits of our products; • the actual and perceived efficacy and safety profile of our products, particularly if unanticipated adverse events related to our products’ treatment arise and create safety concerns among potential patients or prescribers or if new data and analyses we obtain for our products do not support, or are interpreted by some parties to not support, the efficacy of our products; and • the efficacy and safety of our other exon-skipping product candidates and third parties’ competitive therapies. We may not be able to expand the global footprint of our products outside of the U.S. Even though EXONDYS 51 was approved for marketing in the U.S. and in Israel, and VYONDYS 53 and AMONDYS 45 were approved for marketing in the U.S., we may not receive approval to commercialize these products in additional countries. In November 2016, we submitted a MAA for eteplirsen to the EMA and the application was validated in December 2016. As we announced on June 1, 2018, the CHMP of the EMA adopted a negative opinion for eteplirsen. In September 2018, the CHMP of the EMA confirmed its negative opinion for eteplirsen, and the European Commission adopted the CHMP opinion in December 2018. During 2019, we sought follow-up EMA scientific advice for eteplirsen. Once data from our ongoing studies are available, we plan to evaluate future engagement with the EMA on potential next steps. In order to market any product in a country outside of the U.S., we must comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements for approval in those countries regarding demonstration of evidence of the product’s safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, labeling, distribution, advertising, and promotion, as well as pricing and reimbursement of the product. Obtaining marketing approval in a country outside of the U.S. is an extensive, lengthy, expensive and uncertain process, and the regulatory authority may reject an application or delay, limit or deny approval of any of our products for many reasons, including: • we may not be able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities outside the U.S. the risk benefit of our products; • the results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical or clinical significance required for approval by regulatory authorities outside the U.S.; -36- • regulatory authorities outside the U.S. may disagree with the adequacy (number, design, size, controls, conduct or implementation) of our clinical trials prior to granting approval, and we may not be able to generate the required data on a timely basis, or at all; • regulatory authorities outside the U.S. may conclude that data we submit to them fail to demonstrate an appropriate level of safety or efficacy of our products, or that our products’ respective clinical benefits outweigh their safety risks; • regulatory authorities outside the U.S. may not accept data generated at our clinical trial sites or require us to generate additional data or information; • regulatory authorities outside the U.S. may impose limitations or restrictions on the approved labeling of our products, thus limiting intended users or providing an additional hurdle for market acceptance of the product; • regulatory authorities outside the U.S. may identify deficiencies in the manufacturing processes, or may require us to change our manufacturing process or specifications; and • regulatory authorities outside the U.S. may adopt new or revised approval policies and regulations. Approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ significantly from that required to obtain approval in the U.S. In particular, in many foreign countries, it is required that a product receives pricing and reimbursement approval before the product can be distributed commercially. Many foreign countries undertake cost-containment measures that could affect pricing or reimbursement of our products. This can result in substantial delays, and the price that is ultimately approved in some countries may be lower than the price for which we expect to offer our products. Marketing approval in one country does not ensure marketing approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining marketing approval in one country may have a negative effect on the approval process in others. Failure to obtain marketing approval in other countries or any delay or setback in obtaining such approval would impair our ability to develop foreign markets for our products and could adversely affect our business and financial condition. In addition, failure to obtain approval in one country or area may affect sales under the EAP in other countries or areas. Even if we are successful in obtaining regulatory approval of our products in additional countries, our revenue earning capacity will depend on commercial and medical infrastructure, pricing and reimbursement negotiations and decisions with third party payors, including government payors. In addition, we have granted Roche an exclusive option to obtain an exclusive license to commercialize certain products, including eteplirsen, golodirsen and casimersen, outside of the U.S. If this option is exercised, Roche will have sole control over and decision-making authority with respect to the commercialization of such products outside the U.S. We cannot predict whether historical revenues from eteplirsen and golodirsen through our EAP outside the U.S. will continue or whether we will be able to continue to distribute eteplirsen and golodirsen through our EAP. We established a global EAP for eteplirsen, golodirsen and casimersen in countries where these products currently have not been approved. While we generate revenue from the distribution of these products through our EAP, we cannot predict whether historical revenues from this program will continue, whether we will be able to continue to distribute our products through our EAP, or whether revenues will exceed revenues historically generated from sales through our EAP. Reimbursement through national EAPs may cease to be available if authorization for an EAP expires or is terminated. For example, healthcare providers in EAP jurisdictions may not be convinced that their patients benefit sufficiently from our products or alternatively, may prefer to wait until such time as our products are approved by a regulatory authority in their country before prescribing any of our products. Even if a healthcare provider is interested in obtaining access to our products for its patient through the EAP, the patient will not be able to obtain access to our products if funding for the drug is not secured. Any failure to maintain revenues from sales of eteplirsen, golodirsen and casimersen through our EAP and/or to generate revenues from commercial sales of these products exceeding historical sales through our EAP could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. If we are unable to successfully maintain and further develop internal commercialization capabilities, sales of our products may be negatively impacted. We have hired and trained a commercial team and put in the organizational infrastructure we believe we need to support the commercial success of our products in the U.S. Factors that may inhibit our efforts to maintain and further develop commercial capabilities include: • an inability to retain an adequate number of effective commercial personnel; -37- • an inability to train sales personnel, who may have limited experience with our company or our products, to deliver a consistent message regarding our products and be effective in educating physicians on how to prescribe our products; • an inability to equip sales personnel with compliant and effective materials, including medical and sales literature to help them educate physicians and our healthcare providers regarding our products and their proper administration and educate payors on the safety, efficacy and effectiveness profile of our products to support favorable coverage decisions; • unforeseen costs and expenses associated with maintaining and further developing an independent sales and marketing organization; and • restrictions on the ability of our employees to perform their jobs due to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as quarantines and self-isolations. If we are not successful in maintaining an effective commercial, sales and marketing infrastructure, we will encounter difficulty in achieving, maintaining or increasing projected sales of our products in the U.S., which would adversely affect our business and financial condition. If we are unable to execute effectively our sales and marketing activities outside the U.S., we may be unable to generate sufficient product revenue. EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53 and AMONDYS 45 are our first, second and third commercial products, respectively. As a result, our sales, marketing, managerial and other non-technical capabilities are relatively new in the U.S. The establishment and development of our commercial infrastructure outside of the U.S. will continue to be expensive and time consuming, and we may not be able to successfully develop this capability in a timely manner or at all. If we are unable to establish adequate manufacturing, sales, marketing, supply and distribution capabilities, whether independently or with third parties, we may not be able to generate product revenue and may not become profitable outside of the U.S. Furthermore, we have granted Roche an exclusive option to obtain an exclusive license to commercialize certain products, including eteplirsen, golodirsen and casimersen, outside of the U.S. If this option is exercised, Roche will have sole control over and decision-making authority with respect to the commercialization of such products outside the U.S. If we fail to obtain or maintain regulatory exclusivity for our products, then we may not be able to protect our products from competition and our business may be adversely impacted. If a competitor obtains an authorization to market the same or substantially same product before a product of ours is authorized in a given country and is granted regulatory exclusivity, then our product may not be authorized for sale as a result of the competitor’s regulatory exclusivity and as a result, our investment in the development of that product may not be returned. In addition to any patent protection, we rely on various forms of regulatory exclusivity to protect our products. During the development of our products, we anticipate any one of regulatory exclusivities becoming available upon approval of our products. Implementation and enforcement of regulatory exclusivity, which may consist of regulatory data protection and market protection, varies widely from country to country. Failure to qualify for regulatory exclusivity, or failure to obtain or maintain the extent or duration of such protections that we expect in each of the markets for our products due to challenges, changes or interpretations in the law or otherwise, could affect our revenues for our products or our decision on whether to market our products in a particular country or countries or could otherwise have an adverse impact on our results of operations. We are not guaranteed to receive or maintain regulatory exclusivity for our current or future products, and if our products that are granted orphan status were to lose their status as orphan drugs or the data or marketing exclusivity provided for orphan drugs, our business and operations could be adversely affected. Due to the nature of our products and product candidate pipeline, in addition to new chemical entity exclusivity and new biologic exclusivity, orphan drug exclusivity is especially important for our products that are eligible for orphan drug designation. For eligible products, we plan to rely on orphan drug exclusivity to maintain a competitive position. If we do not have adequate patent protection for our products, then the relative importance of obtaining regulatory exclusivity is even greater. While orphan status for any of our products, if granted or maintained, would provide market exclusivity for the time periods specified above upon approval, we would not be able to exclude other companies from obtaining regulatory approval of products using the same or similar active ingredient for the same indication during or beyond the exclusivity period applicable to our product on the basis of orphan drug status (e.g., seven years in the U.S.). Orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug, nor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process. -38- In addition, we may face risks with maintaining regulatory exclusivities for our products, and our protection may be circumvented, even if maintained. For instance, orphan drug exclusivity in the U.S. may be rescinded if (i) an alternative, competing product demonstrates clinical superiority to our product with orphan exclusivity; or (ii) we are unable to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of our orphan products to meet the needs of patients. Moreover, competitors may receive approval of different drugs or biologics for indications for which our prior approved orphan products have exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity in Europe may be modified for several reasons, including a significant change to the orphan medicinal product designations or status criteria after-market authorization of the orphan product ( e.g. , product profitability exceeds the criteria for orphan drug designation), problems with the production or supply of the orphan drug, or a competitor drug, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior than the initial orphan drug. Thus, other companies may have received, or could receive, approval to market a product candidate that is granted orphan drug exclusivity for the same drug or similar drug and same orphan indication as any of our product candida tes for which we plan to file an NDA , BLA or MAA . If that were to happen, our prior approved orphan product s may face competition and any pending NDA , BLA or MAA for our product candidate for that indication may not be approved until the competing company’s period of exclusivity has expired in the U.S. or the EU, as applicable. For example, in January 2020, the FDA issued a draft guidance to clarify its position on when gene therapy products would be considered the “same” or “different” for purposes of orphan drug exclusivity. The draft guidance notes that if two gene therapy products differ in the genes expressed by the products (“transgenes”) and the vectors used to deliver the transgenes are different, then the two gene therapy products are different and could both be approved for the same indication. However, there is considerable uncertainty as to the interpretation of these guidelines, if adopted to become final. If there are other, lesser differences in the products, FDA would make a case-by-case determination as how to apply orphan exclusivity to the competing product, and it is unclear how such case-by-case determinations would be made. As illustrated by this draft guidance, orphan drug exclusivity as applied to gene therapy products is an evolving area subject to change and interpretation by the FDA and therefore we cannot be certain as to how the FDA will apply those rules to our products. The patient population suffering from DMD, LGMDs, and CMT 1A is small and has not been established with precision. If the actual number of patients is smaller than we estimate, our revenue and ability to achieve profitability may be adversely affected. DMD, LGMD, and CMT 1A are rare, fatal genetic disorders. DMD affects an estimated one in approximately every 3,500 to 5,000 males born worldwide, of which up to 13% are estimated to be amenable to exon 51 skipping, up to 8% are estimated to be amenable to exon 53 skipping and up to 8% are estimated to be amenable to exon 45 skipping. LGMDs as a class affect an estimated range of approximately one in every 14,500 to one in every 123,000 individuals. CMT is a group of peripheral nerve disorders affecting approximately one in every 2,500 individuals. CMT type 1A affects approximately 50,000 patients in the U.S. Our estimates of the size of these patient populations are based on limited number of published studies as well as internal analyses. Various factors may decrease the market size of our products and product candidates, including the severity of the disease, patient demographics and the response of patients’ immune systems to our products and product candidates. If the results of these studies or our analysis of them do not accurately reflect the relevant patient population, our assessment of the market may be inaccurate, making it difficult or impossible for us to meet our revenue goals, or to obtain and maintain profitability. We face intense competition and rapid technological change, which may result in other companies discovering, developing or commercializing competitive products. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and subject to significant and rapid technological change. We are aware of many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are actively engaged in research and development in areas in which our products and product candidates are aimed. Some of these competitors are developing or testing product candidates that now, or may in the future, compete directly with our products or product candidates. For example, we face competition in the field of DMD by third parties who are developing or who had once developed: (i) exon skipping product candidates, such as Wave Life Sciences (notably for exons 51 and 53), Nippon Shinyaku (notably for exon 44 and exon 53, for which it has received FDA approval for its product Viltepso (viltolarsen)), Daiichi Sankyo (notably for exon 45), Dyne Therapeutics pursuing antibody-oligonucleotide conjugates for exons 44, 45, 51, and 53, Audentes Therapeutics, Inc. (acquired by Astellas Pharma) (notably for exons 2, 51 and 53), and BioMarin (BMN-351); (ii) gene therapies that express micro-dystrophin or mini-dystrophin, such as Pfizer and Solid Biosciences (in partnership with Ultragenyx); (iii) CRISPR/Cas 9 approaches, such as Exonics Therapeutics (acquired by Vertex Pharmaceuticals), CRISPR Therapeutics and Editas Medicine; (iv) other disease modifying approaches, such as PTC Therapeutics, which has a small molecule candidate, ataluren, that targets nonsense mutations; and (v) other approaches that may be palliative in nature or potentially complementary with our products and product candidates and that are or were once being developed by Santhera, Catabasis, Fibrogen, ReveraGen, Capricor Therapeutics, BioPhytis, Mallinckrodt, and Antisense Therapeutics. Although BioMarin announced on May 31, 2016 its intent to discontinue clinical and regulatory development of drisapersen as well as its other clinical stage candidates, BMN 044, BMN 045 and BMN 053, then-currently in Phase 2 studies for distinct forms of DMD, it further announced its intent to continue to explore the development of next generation oligonucleotides for the treatment of DMD. Indeed, BioMarin recently announced it is pursuing IND enabling studies for BMN-351, an oligonucleotide therapy. In addition, while Wave announced its intention to discontinue development of suvodirsen and suspend development of WVE-N531, it recently announced that it intends to file a CTA for its exon 53 oligonucleotide, WVE-N531. -39- In addition, we are aware of many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are actively engaged in research and development using platform technologies that may be viewed as competing with ours beyond and including those companies mentioned immediately above, such as Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corp., Deciphera Pharmaceuticals, Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Roche Innovation Center Copenhagen (formerly Santaris Pharma A/S), Shire plc (now Takeda), Biogen, Moderna Therapeutics, Avidity, Dyne Therapeutics, Stoke Therapeutics, Fulcrum Therapeutics, Ultragenyx and Sanofi. Additionally, several companies and institutions have entered into collaborations or other agreements for the development of product candidates, including mRNA, gene therapy and gene editing (CRIPSR and AAV, among others) and small molecule therapies that are potential competitors for therapies being developed in the muscular dystrophy, neuromuscular and rare disease space, including, but not limited to, Astellas Pharma, Biogen Inc., Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Ionis, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Sanofi, Shire (now Takeda), Eli Lilly, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Moderna Therapeutics, Inc., Akashi, Catabasis, Capricor Therapeutics, Oxford University, Exonics Therapeutics (acquired by Vertex Pharmaceuticals), and Editas Medicine. If any of our competitors are successful in obtaining regulatory approval for any of their product candidates, it may limit our ability to enter into the market, gain market share or maintain market share in the DMD space or other diseases targeted by our platform technologies, products and product candidate pipeline. It is possible that our competitors will succeed in developing technologies that limit the market size for our products or product candidates, impact the regulatory approval and post-marketing process for our products and product candidates, are more effective than our products or product candidates or would render our technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. Our competitors may, among other things: • develop safer or more effective products; • implement more effective approaches to sales and marketing; • develop less costly products; • obtain preferred formulary status; • obtain regulatory approval more quickly; • have access to more manufacturing capacity; • develop products that are more convenient and easier to administer; • form more advantageous strategic alliances; or • establish superior intellectual property positions. Our revenue could face competitive pressures for any of the above reasons. Moreover, if competing products are marketed in a territory in which we also have the authority to market our products, our sales may diminish or our business could be otherwise materially adversely affected. We have entered into multiple collaborations, including our collaboration with Roche, and may seek or engage in future collaborations, strategic alliances, acquisitions or licensing agreements that complement or expand our business. We may not be able to complete such transactions, and such transactions, if executed, may increase our capital requirements, dilute our stockholders, cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities and subject us to other risks. In order to achieve our long-term business objectives, we actively evaluate various strategic transactions on an ongoing basis, including licensing or acquiring products, technologies or businesses. We may face competition from other companies in pursuing acquisitions and similar transactions in the biotechnology industry. This competition is most intense for approved drugs and late-stage drug candidates, which have the lowest risk and would have the most immediate effect on our financial performance. Our ability to complete transactions may also be limited by applicable antitrust and trade regulation laws and regulations in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions in which we or the operations or assets we seek to acquire carry on business. We have entered into multiple collaborations, including with Roche, Nationwide, Duke University, Genethon, StrideBio, University of Florida, Codiak BioSciences, Hansa Biopharma and Selecta Biosciences. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of such collaborations, and the anticipated benefits of any future collaborations or acquisitions, each of which involves numerous risks, including: • collaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to a collaboration; -40- • collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our products or product candidates based on clinical trial results, changes in their strategic focus due to the acquisition of competitive products, availability of funding, or other external factors, such as a business combination that diverts resources or creates competing priorities; • collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial, stop a clinical trial, abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials, or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing; • collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates; • collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our intellectual property or proprietary information in a way that gives rise to actual or threatened litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential liability; • disputes may arise between us and a collaborator that cause the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our products or product candidates, or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources; • collaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may eliminate our rights to commercialize certain product candidates or may result in a need for additional capital; • failure to successfully develop the acquired or licensed drugs or technology or to achieve strategic objectives, including successfully developing and commercializing the drugs, drug candidates or technologies that we acquire or license; • entry into markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience or where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions; • disruption of our ongoing business, distraction of our management and employees from other opportunities and challenges and retention of key employees; • potential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired company, or acquired or licensed product or technology, including but not limited to, problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges with respect to intellectual property, product quality, safety, accounting practices, employee, customer or third-party relations and other known and unknown liabilities; • liability for activities of the acquired company or licensor before the acquisition or license, including intellectual property infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities; • exposure to litigation or other claims in connection with, or inheritance of claims or litigation risk as a result of an acquisition or license, including but not limited to, claims from terminated employees, customers, former equity holders or other third-parties; • difficulty in integrating the products, product candidates, technologies, business operations and personnel of an acquired asset or company; and • difficulties in the integration of the acquired company’s departments, systems, including accounting, human resource and other administrative systems, technologies, books and records, and procedures, as well as in maintaining uniform standards, controls, including internal control over financial reporting required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related procedures and policies. For example, we will have limited influence and control over the development and commercialization activities of Roche in the territories in which it leads development and commercialization of SRP-9001, and if the exclusive option is exercised, in the territories in which it leads commercialization of certain other products or product candidates. Roche’s development and commercialization activities in the territories where it is the lead party may adversely impact our own efforts in the U.S. Failure by Roche to meet its obligations under the collaboration agreement, to apply sufficient efforts at developing and commercializing collaboration products, or to comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements, may materially adversely affect our business and our results of operations. In addition, to the extent we rely on Roche to commercialize any products for which we obtain regulatory approval, we may receive less revenues than if we commercialized these products ourselves, which could materially harm our prospects. -41- E ven if we achieve the long-term benefits associated with strategic transactions, our expenses and short-term costs may increase materially and adversely affect our liquidity and short-term net income (loss). Future licenses or acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, the creation of contingent liabilities, impairment or expenses related to goodwill, and impairment or amortization expenses related to other intangible assets, which could harm our financial condition. For example, in February 2020, we issued and sold 2,522,227 shares of common stock to Roche Finance in connection with the entry into the collaboration agreement with Roche . Risks Related to the Development of our Product Candidates We may find it difficult to enroll patients in our clinical trials, which could delay or prevent clinical trials of our product candidates. Identifying and qualifying patients to participate in clinical trials of our product candidates is critical to our success. The timing of our clinical trials depends on the speed at which we can recruit eligible patients to participate in testing our product candidates. We have experienced delays in some of our clinical trials, and we may experience similar delays in the future. These delays could result in increased costs, delays in advancing our product development, delays in testing the effectiveness of our technology or termination of the clinical trials altogether. We may not be able to identify, recruit and enroll a sufficient number of patients, or those with required or desired characteristics to achieve diversity in a study, to complete our clinical trials within the expected timeframe. Patient enrollment can be impacted by factors including, but not limited to: • design and complexity and/or commitment of participation required in the study protocol; • size of the patient population; • eligibility criteria for the study in question; • clinical supply availability; • delays in participating site identification, qualification and subsequent activation to enroll; • perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study, including as a result of adverse effects observed in similar or competing therapies; • proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients; • availability of competing therapies and clinical trials; • competition of site efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials; • participating site motivation; • patient referral practices of physicians; • activities of patient advocacy groups; • ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment; and • severity of the disease under investigation. In particular, each of the conditions for which we plan to evaluate our product candidates are rare genetic diseases with limited patient pools from which to draw for clinical trials. Further, because newborn screening for these diseases is not widely adopted, and it can be difficult to diagnose these diseases in the absence of a genetic screen, we may have difficulty finding patients who are eligible to participate in our studies. The eligibility criteria of our clinical trials will further limit the pool of available study participants. Additionally, the process of finding and diagnosing patients may prove costly. The treating physicians in our clinical trials may also use their medical discretion in advising patients enrolled in our clinical trials to withdraw from our studies to try alternative therapies. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic may impact patient ability and willingness to travel to clinical trial sites as a result of quarantines and other restrictions, which may negatively impact enrollment in our clinical trials. -42- We may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials if we cannot enroll the required eligible patients per protocol to participate in the clinical trials required by the FDA or the EMA or other regulatory agencies. Our ability to successfully initiate, enroll and complete a clinical trial in any foreign country is subject to numerous risks unique to conducting business in foreign countries, including: • difficulty in establishing or managing relationships with contract research organizations (“CROs”) and physicians; • different standards for the conduct of clinical trials; • our inability to locate qualified local consultants, physicians and partners; • the potential burden of complying with a variety of foreign laws, medical standards and regulatory requirements, including the regulation of pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and treatment; • ability to procure and deliver necessary clinical trial materials needed to perform the study; and • inability to implement adequate training at participating sites remotely when in person training cannot be completed. If we have difficulty enrolling a sufficient number of patients to conduct our clinical trials as planned, we may need to delay, limit or terminate ongoing or planned clinical trials, any of which would have an adverse effect on our business. Failures or delays in the commencement or completion of ongoing and planned clinical trials of our product candidates negatively impact commercialization efforts; result in increased costs; and delay, prevent or limit our ability to gain regulatory approval of product candidates and to generate revenues and continue our business. Successful completion of clinical trials at each applicable stage of development is a prerequisite to submitting a marketing application to the regulatory agencies and, consequently, the ultimate approval and commercial marketing of any of our product candidates for the indications in which we develop them. We do not know whether any of our clinical trials will begin or be completed, and results announced, as planned or expected, if at all, as the commencement and completion of clinical trials and announcement of results is often delayed or prevented for a number of reasons, including, among others: • denial by the regulatory agencies of permission to proceed with our planned clinical trials or any other clinical trials we may initiate, or placement of a clinical trial on hold; • delays in filing or receiving approvals of additional INDs that may be required; • negative results from our ongoing non-clinical trials or clinical trials; • challenges in identifying, recruiting, enrolling and retaining patients to participate in clinical trials; • challenges with subject compliance within clinical trials; • timely and effectively contract with (under reasonable terms), manage and work with investigators, institutions, hospitals and the CROs/ vendors involved in the clinical trial; • negotiate contracts and other related documents with clinical trial parties and institutional review boards, such as informed consents, CRO agreements and site agreements, which can be subject to extensive negotiations that could cause significant delays in the clinical trial process, with terms possibly varying significantly among different trial sites and CROs and possibly subjecting the Company to various risks; • inadequate quantity or quality of supplies of a product candidate or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials, for example as a result of delays in defining and implementing the manufacturing process for materials used in pivotal trials or for the manufacture of larger quantities or other delays or issues arising in the manufacturing of sufficient supply of finished drug product; • difficulties obtaining institutional review board (“IRB”) approval, and equivalent approval for sites outside the U.S., to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site or sites; • ensure adherence to trial designs and protocols agreed upon and approved by regulatory authorities and applicable legal and regulatory guidelines; • delays or problems in analyzing data, or the need for additional analysis or data or the need to enroll additional patients; • the occurrence of serious adverse events or unexpected drug-related side effects experienced by patients in a clinical trial or unexpected results in ongoing non-clinical trials; • delays in validating endpoints utilized in a clinical trial; -43- • our inability to have formal meetings with the regulatory agencies or to interact with them on a regular basis; • our inability to satisfy the requirements of the regulatory agencies to commence clinical trials, such as developing potency assays and lot release specifications that correlate with the activity or response of the product candidate or other CMC requirements; • the regulatory agencies disagreeing with our clinical trial design and our interpretation of data from clinical trials, or changing the requirements for approval even after the regulatory authority has reviewed and commented on the design for our clinical trials; • reports from non-clinical or clinical testing of competing therapies that raise safety or efficacy concerns; and • the recruitment and retention of employees, consultants or contractors with the required level of expertise. In addition, the impact of COVID-19 has caused disruptions and may cause delays in some of our clinical trials. The recent responses to COVID-19 by healthcare providers and regulatory agencies could delay the commencement of clinical trials, site initiation, protocol compliance, the completion of clinical trials, including the completion of post-marketing requirements and commitments, slow down enrollment, and make the ongoing collection of data for patients enrolled in studies more difficult or intermittent. In addition, the pandemic may impact patient ability and willingness to travel to clinical trial sites as a result of fear, physician recommendation, quarantines and other restrictions, which may negatively impact the execution of clinical trials. Any inability to complete successfully pre-clinical and clinical development could result in additional costs to us or impair our ability to generate revenues from product sales, regulatory and commercialization milestones and royalties. In addition, manufacturing or formulation changes to our product candidates often require additional studies to demonstrate comparability of the modified product candidates to earlier versions. Clinical study delays also shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, which impairs our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and harms our business and results of operations. Results from pre-clinical and early‑stage clinical trials may not be indicative of safety or efficacy in late‑stage clinical trials, and pre-clinical and clinical trials may fail to demonstrate acceptable levels of safety, efficacy, and quality of our product candidates, which could prevent or significantly delay their regulatory approval. To obtain the requisite regulatory approvals to market and sell any of our product candidates, we must demonstrate, through extensive pre-clinical and clinical trials, that the product candidate is safe and effective in humans. Ongoing and future pre-clinical and clinical trials of our product candidates may not show sufficient safety, efficacy or adequate quality to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals. For example, although we believe the data for SRP-9001, SRP-9003 and SRP-5051 collected to date are positive, the additional data we collect may not be consistent with the pre-clinical and/or early clinical data or show a safe benefit that warrants further development or pursuit of a regulatory approval for these product candidates. Furthermore, success in pre-clinical and early clinical trials does not ensure that the subsequent trials will be successful, nor does it predict final results of a confirmatory trial. Some of our clinical trials were conducted with small patient populations and were not blinded or placebo-controlled, making it difficult to predict whether the favorable results that we observed in such trials will be repeated in larger and more advanced clinical trials. For example, in October 2018, Nationwide presented results from a Phase 1/2a micro-dystrophin gene therapy clinical trial in four individuals with DMD enrolled in the trial (Study 101) and, in March 2019, we presented nine-month functional and CK data from baseline from these four individuals, and twelve-month CK data from baseline from one of these individuals. In June 2020, we announced that functional, safety and tolerability data at twelve-months from baseline from these four individuals had been published in JAMA Neurology. In September 2020, we presented functional, safety and tolerability data at 24 months from these four individuals. In January 2021, we released top-line results for Part 1 of Study 102 and interim expression results from Part 2 of Study 102. In addition, in February 2019, we announced expression and biomarker data from the first three-patient low-dose cohort dosed in the SRP-9003 gene therapy trial to treat LGMD type 2E, or beta-sarcoglycanopathy and, in October 2019, we announced nine-month functional data from these three patients. In June 2020, we announced safety and expression results from three clinical trial participants in the high-dose cohort measured at 60 days, and one-year functional data from three clinical trial participants in the low-dose cohort. In September 2020, we announced six-month functional data from three clinical trial participants in the high-dose cohort, and eighteen-month functional data from three clinical trial participants in the low-dose cohort. These data are based on small patient samples, and, given the heterogeneity of DMD and LGMD patients and potential lot-to-lot variability, the data may not be predictive of future results. In addition, we cannot assure that the results of additional data or data from any future trial will yield results that are consistent with the data presented, that we will be able to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of these product candidates, that later trial results will support further development, or even if such later results are favorable, that we will be able to successfully complete the development of, obtain accelerated, conditional or standard regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize any of such product candidates. Similarly, we cannot provide assurances that data from our ongoing and planned studies with respect to our commercially approved products and product candidates will be positive and consistent or that the interpretation by regulators, such as the FDA or EMA, of the data we collect for our products or product candidates will be consistent with our interpretations. -44- Our product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of product candidates, limit the commercial potential or result in significant negative consequences following any potential marketing approval. Our product candidates may cause undesirable side effects. In addition to side effects caused by our product candidates, the administration process or related procedures also can cause adverse side effects. If any such adverse events occur in our trials, we may decide, or the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authorities could order us, to halt, delay or amend pre-clinical development or clinical development of our product candidates or we may be unable to receive regulatory approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. Even if we are able to demonstrate that all future serious adverse events are not product-related, such occurrences could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial. Moreover, if we elect, or are required, to delay, suspend or terminate any clinical trial of any of our product candidates, the commercial prospects of such product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate product revenues from any of these product candidates may be delayed or eliminated. Any of these occurrences may harm our ability to develop other product candidates and may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly. Our gene therapy product candidates may be perceived as unsafe or may result in unforeseen adverse events. Failure of other gene therapy programs, negative public opinion and increased regulatory scrutiny of gene therapy may damage public perception of the safety of our gene therapy product candidates and harm our ability to conduct our business or obtain regulatory approvals for our gene therapy product candidates. Gene therapy remains a newly applied technology, with only a few gene therapy products approved to date in the U.S., the EU or elsewhere. Public perception may be influenced by claims that gene therapy is unsafe, and gene therapy may not gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community. In particular, our success will depend upon physicians who specialize in the treatment of genetic diseases targeted by our product candidates, prescribing treatments that involve the use of our product candidates in lieu of, or in addition to, existing treatments with which they are familiar and for which greater clinical data may be available. In addition, ethical, social and legal concerns about gene therapy, genetic testing and genetic research could result in additional regulations or prohibiting the processes we may use. Federal and state agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments have expressed their intentions to further regulate biotechnology. More restrictive regulations or claims that our product candidates are unsafe or pose a hazard could prevent us from commercializing any products. New government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, regulations, policies or guidance changed, or interpretations by agencies or courts changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. More restrictive government regulations or negative public opinion would harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and may delay or impair the development and commercialization of our gene therapy product candidates or demand for any products we may develop. For example, earlier gene therapy trials led to several well-publicized adverse events, including death. Lack of efficacy and/or serious adverse events related to clinical trials we, our strategic partners or other companies conduct, even if such adverse events are not ultimately attributable to the relevant product candidates or products, and/or failed commercialization of gene therapy products may result in increased government regulation, unfavorable public perception, potential regulatory delays in the testing or approval of our product candidates, stricter labeling requirements for those product candidates that are approved and a decrease in demand for any such product candidates. If there are significant delays in obtaining or we are unable to obtain or maintain required regulatory approvals, we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates in a timely manner or at all, which could impair our ability to generate sufficient revenue and have a successful business. The research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, commercialization, marketing, selling and distribution of drug products are subject to extensive regulation by applicable local, regional and national regulatory authorities and regulations may differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In the U.S., approvals and oversight from federal (e.g., FDA), state and other regulatory authorities are required for these activities. Sale and marketing of our product candidates in the U.S. or other countries is not permitted until we obtain the required approvals from the applicable regulatory authorities. Of the large number of drugs in development in the biopharmaceutical industry, only a small percentage result in the submission of a marketing application to the FDA or an MAA to the EMA and even fewer are approved for commercialization. -45- Our ability to obtain the government or regulatory approvals required to commercialize any of our product candidates in any jurisdiction, including in the U.S. or the EU, cannot be assured, may be significantly delayed or may never be achieved for various reasons including the following: • Our non-clinical, clinical, chemistry, manufacturing and controls and other data and analyses from past, current and future studies for any of our product candidates may not be sufficient to meet regulatory requirements for marketing application approvals. The regulatory authorities could disagree with our interpretations and conclusions regarding data we provide in connection with NDA, BLA or MAA submissions for one or more of our product candidates, and may delay, reject or refuse to accept for review, or approve any submission we make or identify additional requirements for product approval to be submitted upon completion, if ever. In addition, in the U.S., an FDA advisory committee could determine that our data are insufficient to provide a positive recommendation for approval of any NDA or BLA we submit to the FDA. Even if we meet FDA requirements and an advisory committee votes to recommend approval of an NDA or BLA submission, the FDA could still disagree with the advisory committee’s recommendation and deny approval of a product candidate based on their review. • The regulatory approval process for product candidates targeting orphan diseases, such as DMD, that use new technologies and processes, such as antisense oligonucleotide therapies, gene therapy and other alternative approaches or endpoints for the determination of efficacy is uncertain due to, among other factors, evolving interpretations of a new therapeutic class, the broad discretion of regulatory authorities, lack of precedent, small safety databases, varying levels of applicable expertise of regulators or their advisory committees, scientific developments, changes in the competitor landscape, shifting political priorities and changes in applicable laws, rules or regulations and interpretations of the same. As a result of uncertainty in the approval process for products intended to treat serious rare diseases, we may not be able to anticipate, prepare for or satisfy requests or requirements from regulatory authorities, including completing and submitting planned NDAs, BLAs and MAAs for our product candidates, in a timely manner, or at all. Examples of such requests or requirements could include, but are not limited to, conducting additional or redesigned trials and procedures (e.g., additional safety data, patient muscle biopsies, dystrophin analyses and the use of assays), repeating or completing additional analysis of our data, or providing additional supportive data. In addition, in the U.S., an FDA advisory committee or regulators may disagree with our data analysis, interpretations and conclusions at any point in the approval process, which could negatively impact the approval of our NDA or BLA or result in a decision by the Company not to proceed with an NDA or BLA submission for a product candidate based on feedback from regulators. • We may not have the resources required to meet regulatory requirements and successfully navigate what is generally a lengthy, expensive and extensive approval process for commercialization of drug product candidates. Any failure on our part to respond to these requirements in a timely and satisfactory manner could significantly delay or negatively impact confirmatory study timelines and/or the development plans we have for PMO, PPMO, gene therapy-based product candidates or other product candidates. Responding to requests from regulators and meeting requirements for clinical trials, submissions and approvals may require substantial personnel, financial or other resources, which, as a small biopharmaceutical company, we may not be able to obtain in a timely manner or at all. In addition, our ability to respond to requests from regulatory authorities that involve our agents, third party vendors and associates may be complicated by our own limitations and those of the parties we work with. It may be difficult or impossible for us to conform to regulatory guidance or successfully execute our product development plans in response to regulatory guidance, including guidance related to clinical trial design with respect to any NDA, BLA or MAA submissions. Even if our product candidates demonstrate safety and efficacy in clinical studies, the regulatory agencies may not complete their review processes in a timely manner, or we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval. Additional delays may result if an FDA Advisory Committee or other regulatory advisory group or authority recommends non-approval or restrictions on approval. In addition, we may experience delays or rejections based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action, or changes in regulatory agency policy during the period of product development, clinical studies and the review process. Regulatory agencies also may approve a treatment candidate for fewer or more limited indications than requested or may grant approval subject to the performance of post-marketing studies. Furthermore, regulatory agencies may not approve the labeling claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our treatment candidates. Finally, some of our product candidates may require diagnostic tests to ensure we appropriately select patients suitable for treatment. If we are unable to successfully develop diagnostic tests for these product candidates, experience significant delays in doing so, or are unable to obtain required regulatory clearances or approvals for any diagnostic tests, the commercialization of our product candidates may be delayed or prevented. Even if we receive the required regulatory clearance or approvals for certain diagnostic tests, the commercial success of any of our product candidates that require such tests will be dependent upon the continued availability of such tests. -46- Even after approval and commercialization of a product candidate, we remain subject to ongoing regulatory compliance and oversight to maintain our approval. Conducting our confirmatory studies could take years to complete, could yield negative or uninterpretable results or could result in an FDA determination that the studies do not provide the safety and efficacy requirements to maintain regulatory approval. If we or any of our strategic partners are unable to develop, or obtain regulatory approval for, or, if approved, maintain regulatory compliance and successfully commercialize, our product candidates, our business will be materially harmed. We are investing significant resources in the development of novel gene therapy product candidates. Only a few gene therapy products have been approved in the U.S. and EU. If we are unable to show the safety and efficacy of these product candidates, experience delays in doing so or are unable to successfully commercialize at least one of these drugs, our business would be materially harmed. We are investing significant resources in the development of our gene therapy product candidates. We believe that a significant portion of the long-term value attributed to our company by investors is based on the commercial potential of these product candidates. There can be no assurance that any development problems we experience in the future related to our gene therapy programs will not cause significant delays or unanticipated costs, or that such development problems can be solved. Development problems and delays in one program may delay the development of other programs. Early results from ongoing clinical trials may differ materially from final results from such clinical trials. The results from pre-clinical and early clinical studies do not always accurately predict results in later, large-scale clinical trials. We may also experience delays in developing a sustainable, reproducible and commercial-scale manufacturing process or transferring that process to commercial partners, which may prevent us from completing our clinical trials or commercializing our products on a timely or profitable basis, if at all. In addition, the clinical trial requirements of the FDA, the EMA, and other regulatory agencies and the criteria these regulators use to determine the safety and efficacy of a product candidate vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use and market of the potential products. The regulatory approval process for novel product candidates such as ours can be more expensive and take longer than for other, better known or more extensively studied pharmaceutical or other product candidates. Currently, only a few gene therapy products have been approved in the Western world. Given the few precedents of approved gene therapy products, it is difficult to determine how long it will take or how much it will cost to obtain regulatory approvals for our gene therapy product candidates in the U.S., the EU or other jurisdictions. Approvals by the EMA and the European Commission may not be indicative of what the FDA may require for approval. Regulatory requirements governing gene therapy products have evolved and may continue to change in the future. Within the FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (“CBER”) regulates gene therapy products. Within the CBER, the review of gene therapy and related products is consolidated in the Office of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies, and the FDA has established the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER on its reviews. The CBER works closely with the National Institutes of Health (the “NIH”). The FDA and the NIH have published guidance documents with respect to the development and submission of gene therapy protocols. For example, on January 28, 2020, the FDA issued final guidance documents that updated draft guidance documents that were originally released in July 2018 to reflect recent advances in the field, and to set forth the framework for the development, review and approval of gene therapies. These final guidance documents pertain to the development of gene therapies for the treatment of specific disease categories, including rare diseases, and to manufacturing and long-term follow up issues relevant to gene therapy, among other topics. At the same time the FDA issued a new draft guidance document describing the FDA’s approach for determining whether two gene therapy products were the same or different for the purpose of assessing orphan drug exclusivity. In addition, the FDA can put an IND on clinical hold if the information in an IND is not sufficient to assess the risks in pediatric patients. These regulatory review agencies, committees and advisory groups and the new requirements and guidelines they promulgate may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to perform additional or larger studies, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of these treatment candidates or lead to significant post-approval studies, limitations or restrictions. As we advance our product candidates, we will be required to consult with these regulatory and advisory groups and comply with applicable requirements and guidelines. If we fail to do so, we may be required to delay or discontinue development of our product candidates. If the anticipated or actual timing of marketing approvals for our gene therapy product candidates, or the market acceptance of these product candidates, if approved, including treatment reimbursement levels agreed to by third-party payors, do not meet the expectations of investors or public market analysts, the market price of our common stock would likely decline. -47- Because we are developing product candidates for the treatment of certain diseases in which there is little clinical experience and we are using new endpoints or methodologies, there is increased risk that the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authorities may not consider the endpoints of our clinical trials to provide clinically meaningful results and that these results may be difficult to analyze. During the FDA review process, we will need to identify success criteria and endpoints such that the FDA will be able to determine the clinical efficacy and safety profile of our product candidates. As we are developing novel treatments for diseases in which there is little clinical experience with new endpoints and methodologies, such as gene therapy, there is heightened risk that the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory bodies may not consider the clinical trial endpoints to provide clinically meaningful results (reflecting a tangible benefit to patients). In addition, the resulting clinical data and results may be difficult to analyze. Even if the FDA does find our success criteria to be sufficiently validated and clinically meaningful, we may not achieve the pre-specified endpoints to a degree of statistical significance. Achieving appropriate statistical power may be challenging for some of the ultra-rare genetically defined diseases we are targeting in our programs, especially if the acceptance of descriptive data is not yet established. In addition, different methodologies, assumptions and applications we utilize to assess particular safety or efficacy parameters may yield different statistical results. Even if we believe the data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates are promising, these data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities. Pre-clinical and clinical data can be interpreted in different ways. Accordingly, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities could interpret these data in different ways from us or our partners, which could delay, limit or prevent full or accelerated regulatory approval. If our study data do not consistently or sufficiently demonstrate the safety or efficacy of any of our product candidates, the regulatory approvals for such product candidates could be significantly delayed as we work to meet approval requirements, or, if we are not able to meet these requirements, such approvals could be withheld or withdrawn. Fast track product, breakthrough therapy, priority review, or Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (“RMAT”) designation by the FDA, or access to the PRIME scheme by the EMA, for our product candidates may not lead to faster development or regulatory review or approval process, and it does not increase the likelihood that our product candidates will receive marketing approval. We may seek fast track, breakthrough therapy designation, RMAT designation, PRIME scheme access or priority review designation for our product candidates if supported by the results of clinical trials. A fast track product designation is designed to facilitate the clinical development and expedite the review of drugs intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition which demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. A RMAT designation is designed to accelerate approval for regenerative advanced therapies such as our gene therapy product candidates. Priority review designation is intended to speed the FDA marketing application review timeframe for drugs that treat a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. PRIME is a scheme provided by the EMA to enhance support for the development of medicines that target an unmet medical need. For drugs and biologics that have been designated as fast track products or breakthrough therapies, or granted access to the PRIME scheme, interaction and communication between the regulatory agency and the sponsor of the trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development. Sponsors of drugs with fast track products or breakthrough therapies may also be able to submit marketing applications on a rolling basis, meaning that the FDA may review portions of a marketing application before the sponsor submits the complete application to the FDA, if the sponsor pays the user fee upon submission of the first portion of the marketing application. For products that receive a priority review designation, the FDA's marketing application review goal is shortened to six months, as opposed to ten months under standard review. This review goal is based on the date the FDA accepts the marketing application for review, this application validation period typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. RMAT designations will accelerate approval but the exact mechanisms have not yet been announced by FDA. Designation as a fast track product, breakthrough therapy, RMAT, PRIME, or priority review product is within the discretion of the regulatory agency. Accordingly, even if we believe one of our product candidates meets the criteria for designation as a fast track product, breakthrough therapy, RMAT, PRIME, or priority review product, the agency may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation. In any event, the receipt of such a designation for a product candidate may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional regulatory procedures and does not assure ultimate marketing approval by the agency. In addition, regarding fast track products and breakthrough therapies, the FDA may later decide that the products no longer meet the conditions for qualification as either a fast track product, RMAT, or a breakthrough therapy or, for priority review products, decide that period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. -48- We may not be able to advance all of our programs, and w e may use our financial and human resources to pursue particular program s and fail to capitalize on programs that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success. Our pipeline includes more than 40 programs in various stages of development for a broad range of diseases and disorders. We plan to expand our pipeline through internal research and development and through strategic transactions. Because we have limited resources, we may not be able to advance all of our programs. We may also forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with certain programs or for indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs for product candidates may not yield any commercially viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through strategic collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate, or we may allocate internal resources to a product candidate in a therapeutic area in which it would have been more advantageous to enter into a partnering arrangement. Risks Related to Third Parties If we are unable to maintain our agreements with third parties to distribute our products to patients, our results of operations and business could be adversely affected. We rely on third parties to commercially distribute our products to patients in the U.S. We have contracted with a third-party logistics company to warehouse our products and with distributors and specialty pharmacies to sell and distribute our products to patients. A specialty pharmacy is a pharmacy that specializes in the dispensing of medications for complex or chronic conditions that require a high level of patient education and ongoing management. This distribution network requires significant coordination with our sales and marketing and finance organizations. In addition, failure to coordinate financial systems could negatively impact our ability to accurately report product revenue from our products. If we are unable to effectively manage the distribution process, the sales of our products, as well as any future products we may commercialize, could be delayed or severely compromised and our results of operations may be harmed. In addition, the use of third parties involves certain risks, including, but not limited to, risks that these organizations will: • not provide us with accurate or timely information regarding their inventories, the number of patients who are using our products or serious adverse events and/or product complaints regarding our products; • not effectively sell or support our products; • reduce or discontinue their efforts to sell or support our products; • not devote the resources necessary to sell our products in the volumes and within the time frame we expect; • be unable to satisfy financial obligations to us or others; or • cease operations. Any such events may result in decreased product sales, lower product revenue, loss of revenue, and/or reputational damage, which would harm our results of operations and business. With respect to the pre-commercial distribution of our products to patients outside of the U.S., we have contracted with third party distributors and service providers to distribute our products in certain countries through our EAP. We will need to continue building out our network for commercial distribution in jurisdictions in which our products are approved, which will also require third party contracts. The use of distributors and service providers involves certain risks, including, but not limited to, risks that these organizations will not comply with applicable laws and regulations, or not provide us with accurate or timely information regarding serious adverse events and/or product complaints regarding our products. Any such events may result in regulatory actions that may include suspension or termination of the distribution and sale of our products in a certain country, loss of revenue, and/or reputational damage, which could harm our results of operations and business. Furthermore, a significant outbreak of COVID-19 at one of our third-party logistics, distribution, or specialty pharmacy sites could lead to a delay in the commercial or pre-commercial shipments of our products to patients and hospitals. -49- We rely on third parties to conduct some aspects of our early stage research and pre-clinical and clinical development. The inadequate performance by or loss of any of these third parties could affect the development and commercialization of our product candidate development. We have relied upon, and plan to continue to rely upon, third parties to conduct some aspects of our early stage research and pre-clinical and clinical development with respect to certain of our product candidates, including our follow-on exon-skipping product candidates, PPMO, gene therapy and gene editing product candidates. Our third-party collaborators may not commit sufficient resources or adequately develop our programs for these candidates. If our third-party collaborators fail to commit sufficient resources to any of our product candidates or to carry out their contractual duties or obligations, our programs related to any particular product candidate could be delayed, terminated, or unsuccessful. Furthermore, if we fail to make required payments to these third-party collaborators, including up-front, milestone, reimbursement or royalty payments, or to observe other obligations in our agreements with them, these third parties may not be required to perform their obligations under our respective agreements with them and may have the right to terminate such agreements. In addition, if our strategic partners experience regulatory delays for the development of their clinical product candidates, including clinical holds, our opportunities to commercialize products may be delayed. We also have relied upon and plan to continue to rely upon third-party CROs to monitor and manage data completeness for our ongoing pre-clinical and clinical programs. We rely on these parties for execution of our pre-clinical and clinical trials, and we control only certain aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol and legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on collaborators and CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. The individuals at our third-party collaborators and CROs who conduct work on our behalf, including their sub-contractors, are not always our employees, and although we participate in the planning of our early stage research and pre-clinical and clinical programs, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources or exercise appropriate oversight of these programs, except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such third parties. If our collaborators and CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our pre-clinical and clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates. As a result, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed. Our reliance on third parties requires us to share our proprietary information, which increases the possibility that a competitor will discover them or that our proprietary information will be misappropriated or inadvertently disclosed. Our reliance on third-party collaborators requires us to disclose our proprietary information to these parties, which could increase the risk that a competitor will discover this information or that this information will be misappropriated or disclosed without our intent to do so. If any of these events were to occur, then our ability to obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights could be irrevocably jeopardized, and costly, distracting litigation could ensue. Furthermore, if these third parties cease to continue operations and we are not able to quickly find a replacement provider or we lose information or items associated with our products or product candidates, our development programs may be delayed. Although we carefully manage our relationships with our third-party collaborators and CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects. Risks Related to Manufacturing We currently rely on third parties to manufacture our products and to produce our product candidates; our dependence on these parties, including failure on our part to accurately anticipate product demand and timely secure manufacturing capacity to meet commercial, EAP, clinical and pre-clinical product demand may impair the availability of product to successfully support various programs, including research and development and the potential commercialization of our product candidates. We currently do not have the internal ability to undertake the manufacturing process for our products or product candidates in the quantities needed to meet commercial, clinical or EAPs demand for our products, or to conduct our research and development programs and conduct clinical trials. Therefore, we rely on, and expect to continue relying on for the foreseeable future, a limited number of third parties to manufacture and supply materials (including raw materials and subunits), API and drug product, as well as to perform additional steps in the manufacturing process, such as labeling and packaging of vials and storage of our products and product candidates. The limited number of third parties with facilities and capabilities suited for the manufacturing process of our products and product candidates creates a heightened risk that we may not be able to obtain materials and APIs in the quantity and purity that we require. -50- In addition, the process for adding new manufacturing capacity is lengthy and often cause s delays in development efforts. Any interruption of the development or operation of those facilities due to, among other reasons, events such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic , order delays for equipment or materials, equipment malfunction s , quality control and quality assurance issues, regulatory delays and possible negative effects of such delays on supply chains and expected timelines for product availability, production yield issues, shortages of qualified personnel, discontinuation of a facility or business or failure or damage to a facility by natural disasters , such as earthquake s or fire s , could result in the cancellation of shipments, loss of product in the manufacturing process or a shortfall in supply of our products , product candidates or materials. If these third parties cease providing quality manufacturing and related services to us, and we are not able to engage appropriate replacements in a timely manner, our ability to manufacture our products or product candidates in sufficient quality and quantity required for our planned commercial, pre-clinical and clinical or EAPs, our various product research, development and commercialization efforts would be adversely affected. Furthermore, a ny problems in our manufacturing process or the facilities with which we contract make us a less attractive collaborator for potential partners, including larger pharmaceutical companies and academic research institutions, which could limit our access to additional attractive development programs. Problems in third-party manufacturing processes or facilities also restrict our ability to meet market demand. We, through our third-party manufacturers, seek to produce or produce supply of our products and product candidates. In light of the limited number of third parties with the expertise to produce our products and product candidates, the lead time needed to manufacture them, and the availability of underlying materials, we may not be able to, in a timely manner or at all, establish or maintain sufficient commercial and other manufacturing arrangements on the commercially reasonable terms necessary to provide adequate supply of our products and product candidates. Furthermore, we may not be able to obtain the significant financial capital that may be required in connection with such arrangements. Even after successfully engaging third parties to execute the manufacturing process for our products and product candidates, such parties may not comply with the terms and timelines they have agreed to for various reasons, some of which may be out of their or our control, which impacts our ability to execute our business plans on expected or required timelines in connection with the commercialization of our products and the continued development of our product candidates. When we enter into long-term manufacturing agreements that contain exclusivity provisions and /or substantial termination penalties, we constrain our operational flexibility. A significant outbreak of COVID-19 at one of our partner sites could lead to delays in the manufacturing of our products and product candidates. In addition, the need to prioritize rated orders issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency pursuant to the U.S. Defense Production Act could impact the manufacturing, supply chain and distribution of our products and product candidates. The third parties we use in the manufacturing process for our products and product candidates may fail to comply with cGMP regulations. Our contract manufacturers are required to produce our materials, APIs and drug products under cGMP. We and our contract manufacturers are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA, EMA and corresponding state and foreign authorities to ensure strict compliance with cGMP and other applicable government regulations. In addition, before we can begin to commercially manufacture our product candidates in third-party or our own facilities, we must obtain regulatory approval from the FDA, which includes a review of the manufacturing process and facility. A manufacturing authorization also must be obtained from the appropriate EU regulatory authorities and may be required by other foreign regulatory authorities. The timeframe required to obtain such approval or authorization is uncertain. In order to obtain approval, we need to demonstrate that all of our processes, methods and equipment are compliant with cGMP, and perform extensive audits of vendors, contract laboratories and suppliers. In complying with cGMP, we are obligated to expend time, money and effort in production, record keeping and quality control to seek to assure that the product meets applicable specifications and other requirements. We do not have direct operational control over a third-party manufacturer’s compliance with regulations and requirements. In addition, changes in cGMP could negatively impact the ability of our contract manufacturers to complete the manufacturing process of our products and product candidates in a compliant manner on the schedule we require for commercial and clinical trial use, respectively. Failure to achieve and maintain compliance with cGMP and other applicable government regulations, including failure to detect or control anticipated or unanticipated manufacturing errors, results in product recalls, clinical holds, delayed or withheld approvals, patient injury or death. This risk is particularly heightened as we optimize manufacturing for our product candidates. For example, we were notified by the Research Institute at Nationwide that they received a letter from the FDA on July 24, 2018, stating that their Phase 1/2a DMD micro-dystrophin gene therapy trial had been placed on clinical hold due to the presence of a trace amount of DNA fragment in research-grade third-party supplied plasmid (the “Clinical Hold”). The Research Institute, working with us, developed an action plan with immediate plans to submit for review by the FDA, which included the use of cGMP plasmid for the program. On September 24, 2018, we announced that the FDA had lifted the Clinical Hold. -51- Failure by our contract manufacturers to adhere to applicable cGMP and other applicable government regulations , or our contract manufacturers experienc ing manufacturing problems, may result in significant negative consequences, including product seizures or recalls, postponement or cancellation of clinical trials, loss or delay of product approval, fines and sanctions, loss of revenue, termination of the development of a product candidate, reputational damage, shipment delays, inventory shortages, inventory write-offs and other product-related charges and increased manufacturing costs. If we experience any of these consequences , the success of our commercialization of our products and/or our development efforts for our product candidates could be significantly delayed, fail or otherwise be negatively impacted. We may not be able to successfully scale up manufacturing of our products or product candidates in sufficient quality and quantity or within targeted timelines, or be able to secure ownership of intellectual property rights developed in this process, which could negatively impact the commercial success of our products and/or the development of our product candidates. We are working to increase manufacturing capacity and scale up production of some of the components of our drug products. Our focus remains on (i) achieving larger-scale manufacturing capacity for our products and product candidates throughout the manufacturing supply chain, (ii) continuing to increase material and API production capacity to provide the anticipated amounts of drug product needed for our planned studies for our product candidates and (iii) optimizing manufacturing for our follow-on exon skipping product candidates and other programs, including PPMO and gene therapy. We may not be able to successfully increase manufacturing capacity or scale up the production of materials, APIs and drug products, whether in collaboration with third party manufacturers or on our own, in a manner that is safe, compliant with cGMP conditions or other applicable legal or regulatory requirements, in a cost-effective manner, in a time frame required to meet our timeline for commercialization, clinical trials and other business plans, or at all. Challenges complying with cGMP requirements and other quality issues arise during efforts to increase manufacturing capacity and scale up production. We experience such issues in connection with manufacturing, packaging and storage of our products and product candidates, and during shipping and storage of the APIs or finished drug product. In addition, in order to release our products for commercial use and demonstrate stability of product candidates for use in clinical trials (and any subsequent drug products for commercial use), our manufacturing processes and analytical methods must be validated in accordance with regulatory guidelines. Failure to successfully validate, or maintain validation of, our manufacturing processes and analytical methods or demonstrate adequate purity, stability or comparability of our products or product candidates in a timely or cost-effective manner, or at all, may undermine our commercial efforts. Failure to successfully validate our manufacturing processes and analytical methods or to demonstrate adequate purity, stability or comparability, will negatively impact the commercial availability of our products and the continued development and/or regulatory approval of our product candidates, which could significantly harm our business. During our work with our third-party manufacturers to increase and optimize manufacturing capacity and scale up production, they may make proprietary improvements in the manufacturing and scale-up processes for our products or product candidates. We may not own or be able to secure ownership of such improvements or may have to share the intellectual property rights to those improvements. Additionally, we may need additional processes, technologies and validation studies, which could be costly and which we may not be able to develop or acquire from third parties. Failure to secure the intellectual property rights required for the manufacturing process needed for large-scale clinical trials or commercialization of our products or the continued development of our product candidates could cause significant delays in our business plans or otherwise negatively impact the commercialization of our products or the continued development of our product candidates. Products intended for use in gene therapies are novel, complex and difficult to manufacture. We could experience production problems that result in delays in our development or commercialization of gene therapy programs, limit the supply of our products or otherwise harm our business. We currently have development, manufacturing and testing agreements with third parties to manufacture supplies of our gene therapy product candidates. Several factors could cause production interruptions, including equipment malfunctions, facility contamination, raw material shortages or contamination, natural disasters, disruption in utility services, human error or disruptions in the operations of suppliers. The physical and chemical properties of biologics such as ours generally cannot be fully characterized. As a result, assays of the finished product may not be sufficient to ensure that the product will perform in the intended manner. Accordingly, we employ multiple steps to control our manufacturing process to assure that the process works and the product candidate is made strictly and consistently in compliance with the process. Problems with the manufacturing process, even minor deviations from the normal process, could result in product defects or manufacturing failures that result in lot failures, product recalls, product liability claims or insufficient inventory. We may encounter problems achieving adequate quantities and quality of clinical and/or commercial-grade materials that meet FDA, EMA or other applicable foreign standards or specifications with consistent and acceptable production yields and costs. -52- In addition, the FDA, the EMA and other foreign regulatory authorities may require us to submit samples of any lot of any approved product together with the protocols showing the results of applicable tests at any time. Under some circumstances, the FDA, the EMA or other foreign regulatory authorities may require that we not distribute a lot until the competent authority authorizes its release. Slight deviations in the manufacturing process, including those affecting quality attributes and stability and deviations among different sites , may result in unacceptable changes in the product that could result in lot failures or product recalls. Lot failures or product recalls could cause us to delay clinical trials or product launches which could be costly to us and otherwise harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. As our product candidates advance to later stage clinical trials, it is customary that various aspects of the development program, such as manufacturing, formulation and other processes, and methods of administration, may be altered to optimize the candidates and processes for scale-up necessary for later stage clinical trials and potential approval and commercialization. These changes may not produce the intended optimization, including production of drug substance and drug product of a quality and in a quantity sufficient for Phase 3 clinical stage development or for commercialization, which may cause delays in the initiation or completion of clinical trials and greater costs. We may also need to conduct additional studies to demonstrate comparability between newly manufactured drug substance and/or drug product for commercialization relative to previously manufactured drug substance and/or drug product for clinical trials. Demonstrating comparability may require us to incur additional costs or delay initiation or completion of clinical trials and, if unsuccessful, could require us to complete additional preclinical studies or clinical trials. We also may encounter problems hiring and retaining the experienced scientific, quality control and manufacturing personnel needed to operate our manufacturing process which could result in delays in our production or difficulties in maintaining compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. Furthermore, no manufacturer currently has the capacity and scalability to produce our vectors or gene therapy product candidates at commercial levels. Even if we timely develop a manufacturing process and successfully transfer it to the third-party vector and product manufacturers or successfully and timely develop our internal capacity, if we or such third-party manufacturers are unable to produce the necessary quantities of viral vectors and our product candidates, or in compliance with GMP or other pertinent regulatory requirements, and within our planned time frame and cost parameters, it may result in delays in our development plans or increased capital expenditures, and the development and sales of our products, if approved, may be materially harmed. Risks Related to our Intellectual Property Our success, competitive position and future revenue depend in part on our ability and the abilities of our licensors and other collaborators to obtain, maintain and defend the patent protection for our products, product candidates, and platform technologies, to preserve our trade secrets, and to prevent third parties from infringing on our proprietary rights. We currently directly hold various issued patents and patent applications, or have exclusive license or option rights to issued patents and patent applications, in each case in the U.S. as well as other countries that protect our products, product candidates and platform technologies. We anticipate filing additional patent applications both in the U.S. and in other countries. Our success will depend, in significant part, on our ability to obtain, maintain and defend our U.S. and foreign patents covering our products, product candidates and platform technologies as well as preserving our trade secrets for these assets. The patent process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining, maintaining, or defending our patents. Even when our patent claims are allowed, the claims may not issue, or in the event of issuance, may not be sufficient to protect our products, product candidates or platform technologies. The patent positions of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. This uncertainty is heightened for our PMO-based products and product candidates and gene therapy-based product candidates for which there has been little patent litigation involving such technologies. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents has emerged to date in the U.S. and tests used for determining the patentability of patent claims in all technologies are in flux. The USPTO and patent offices in other jurisdictions have often required that patent applications concerning pharmaceutical and/or biotechnology-related inventions be limited or narrowed substantially to cover only the specific innovations exemplified in the patent application, thereby limiting the scope of protection against competitive challenges. Accordingly, even if we or our licensors are able to obtain patents, the patents might be substantially narrower than anticipated. Thus, there is no assurance as to the degree and range of protections any of our patents, if issued, may afford us or whether patents will be issued. Patents which may be issued to us may be subjected to further governmental review that may ultimately result in the reduction of their scope of protection, and pending patent applications may have their requested breadth of protection significantly limited before being issued, if issued at all. The pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences patent situation outside the U.S. can be even more uncertain. -53- As a matter of public policy, there might be significant pressure on governmental bodies to limit the scope of patent protection or impose compulsory licenses for disease treatments that prove successful , particularly as a tactic to impose a price control . Additionally, competitors may leverage such pressure to enhance their ability to exploit these laws to create, develop and market competing products. We may be able to assert that certain activities engaged in by our competitors infringe on our current or future patent rights. To the extent that we enforce our patents, an alleged infringer may deny infringement and/or counter-claim that our patents are not valid, and if successful, could negatively impact our patent estate. We may not be able to successfully defend patents necessary to prevent competitors from commercializing competing product candidates. To the extent we assert infringement of a patent that covers a competing product as well as our own patent, or such a patent is otherwise challenged without our initiation, the patent protection for our own product could be materially adversely affected should an infringing competitor be successful challenging the validity of our patent. Our patent rights might be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or otherwise not provide any competitive advantage. Defending our patent positions may require significant financial resources and could negatively impact other Company objectives. Even if we successfully enforce our patent rights against a competitor, we may not be able to recover adequate damages or obtain other desired relief. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, one or more motivated third parties may file an ANDA, seeking approval of a generic copy of an innovator product approved under the NDA pathway such as our PMO products, or a NDA under Section 505(b)(2), which may be for a new or improved version of the original innovator products. In certain circumstances, motivated third parties may file such an ANDA or NDA under Section 505(b)(2) as early as the so-called “NCE-1” date that is one year before the expiry of the five-year period of New Chemical Entity exclusivity or more generally four years after NDA approval. The third parties are allowed to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the innovator’s product, may not need to conduct clinical trials and can market a competing version of a product after the expiration or loss of patent exclusivity or the expiration or loss of regulatory exclusivity and often charge significantly lower prices. Upon the expiration or loss of patent protection or the expiration or loss of regulatory exclusivity for a product, the major portion of revenues for that product may be dramatically reduced in a very short period of time. If we are not successful in defending our patents and regulatory exclusivities, we will not derive the expected benefit from them. As such, a third party could be positioned to market an ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) product that competes with one of our products prior to the expiry of our patents if the third party successfully challenged the validity of our patents protecting the product. The patent landscape is continually evolving, and we may be able to assert that certain activities engaged in by third parties infringe our current or future patent rights. There has been, and we believe that there will continue to be, significant litigation in the biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical industries regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. As such, the patents and patent applications that we own, license, have optioned, and rely on for exclusivity for our product candidates may be challenged. Uncertainty over intellectual property in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry has been the source of litigation and other disputes, which is inherently costly and unpredictable. Litigation, interferences, oppositions, inter partes reviews, administrative challenges or other similar types of proceedings are, have been and may in the future be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of certain of our proprietary rights, and in other instances to determine the validity, scope or non-infringement of certain patent rights claimed by third parties to be pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our products. We may also face challenges to our patent and regulatory exclusivities covering our products by third parties, including manufacturers of generics and biosimilars that may choose to launch or attempt to launch their products before the expiration of our patent or regulatory exclusivity. Litigation, interferences, oppositions, inter partes reviews, administrative challenges or other similar types of proceedings are unpredictable and may be protracted, expensive and distracting to management. The outcomes of such proceedings could adversely affect the validity and scope of our patents or other proprietary rights, hinder our ability to manufacture and market our products, require us to seek a license for the infringed products or technology or result in the assessment of significant monetary damages against us that may exceed amounts, if any, accrued in our financial statements. An adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or a failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products. Furthermore, payments under any licenses that we are able to obtain would reduce our profits derived from our products. Any of these circumstances could result in financial, business or reputational harm to us or could cause a decline or volatility in our stock price. On September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (the “Leahy-Smith Act”), was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law, including provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted, and may also affect patent litigation. The USPTO has issued regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act. In view of the long timelines for interpreting legal provisions in the court system and the evolving nature of our laws, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. For instance, a third party may petition the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“PTAB”) seeking to challenge the validity of some or all of the claims in any of our patents through an inter partes review or other post-grant proceeding. Should the PTAB institute an inter partes review or other proceeding and decide that some or all of the claims in the challenged patent are invalid, such a decision, if upheld on appeal, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. -54- Our business prospects will be impaired if third parties successfully assert that our products, product candidates, or platform technologies infringe proprietary rights of such third parties. Similar to us, competitors continually seek intellectual property protection for their technology. Several of our development programs, particularly gene therapy programs, focus on therapeutic areas that have been the subject of extensive research and development by third parties for many years and have been protected with third party patent rights. Due to the amount of intellectual property in our various fields of technology, we cannot be certain that we do not infringe intellectual property rights of competitors or other third parties or that we will not infringe intellectual property rights of competitors or other third parties granted or created in the future. Our competitors or other third parties might have obtained, or could obtain in the future, patents that threaten, limit, interfere with or eliminate our ability to make, use and sell our products, product candidates or platform technologies in important commercial markets. Due to the nature of our various partnerships, collaborators, licensors, CROs, CMOs and the like, we may be subjected to claims of infringement arising from activities conducted by these third parties in connection with our product candidates, whether or not such activities are authorized by us. As a result, we may be subject to substantial unforeseen costs, distraction, and financial liability if a third party making such a claim was successful in obtaining a final judgment of infringement and validity. In order to maintain or obtain freedom to operate for our products and product candidates, we may incur significant expenses, including those associated with entering into agreements with third parties that require milestone and royalty payments. Additionally, if we were to challenge the patent rights of our competitors or otherwise defend against allegations of infringement, misappropriation or related claims, we could incur substantial costs and ultimately might not be successful. If our products, product candidates, or platform technologies are alleged to infringe or are determined to infringe enforceable proprietary rights of others, we could incur substantial costs and may have to: • obtain rights or licenses from others, which might not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all; • abandon development of an infringing product candidate, or cease commercialization of an infringing product; • redesign our products, product candidates or processes to avoid infringement; • pay damages; and/or • defend litigation or administrative proceedings which might be costly whether we win or lose, and which could result in a substantial diversion of financial and management resources. Any of these events could result in product and product candidate development delays or cessation, and as such substantially harm our potential earnings, financial condition and operations. The patent landscape of our product candidates is continually evolving and multiple parties, including both commercial entities and academic institutions, may have rights to claims or may be pursuing additional claims that could provide these parties a basis to assert that our products, product candidates or platform technologies infringe on the intellectual property rights of such parties. There has been, and we believe that there will continue to be, significant litigation in the biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical industries regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Risks Related to our Business Operations The outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted, and may continue to result in disruptions to our commercialization, clinical trials, manufacturing and other business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and prospects. The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a substantial public health and economic challenge around the world. The rapid spread of COVID-19 has led to the implementation of various responses, including government-imposed quarantines, shelter-in-place mandates, sweeping restrictions on travel, mandatory shutdowns for non-essential businesses, requirements regarding social distancing, and other public health safety measures, as well as reported adverse impacts on healthcare resources, facilities and providers across the United States and in other countries. In response to the pandemic, healthcare providers have, and may need to further, reallocate resources, such as physicians, staff, hospital beds, and intensive care unit facilities, as they prioritize limited resources and personnel capacity to focus on the treatment of patients with COVID-19 and implement limitations on access to hospitals and other medical institutions due to concerns about the potential spread of COVID-19 in such settings. These actions have and may continue to negatively impact commercialization, clinical trials, manufacturing and other business operations, including: • Commercial: The response to COVID-19 by healthcare providers has made it difficult for some patients, especially those dependent on a hospital setting, to receive infusions or initiate treatment with our commercial products. In addition, as a result of the pandemic, some patients may choose to delay or stop treatment to avoid a visit to a hospital or a visit of a third party in their homes to minimize the risk of infection. The impact of COVID-19 may also result in delays in processing reauthorizations and modifications to program benefits by insurers, making it difficult for patients to obtain or maintain favorable coverage decisions for our products. In addition, the increase in unemployment due to the pandemic has resulted in decreased insurance coverage for many individuals. These challenges may continue for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is uncertain, and are expected to reduce our revenue and cash flows. -55- • Clinical trials: The impact of COVID-19 has caused disruptions and may cause delays in some of our clinical trials. Missing data could undermine data integrity and probability of success. The recent responses to COVID-19 by healthcare providers and regulatory agencies could delay the commencement of trials, site initiation, compliance in the trials, the completion of trials, including the completion of post-marketing requirements and commitments, slow down enrollment, and make the ongoing collection of data for patients enrolled in studies more difficult or intermittent. We are implementing certain strategy and technology in an attempt to mitigate this risk in the event of subsequent outbreaks. In addition, as COVID-19 continues to spread, some participants and clinical investigators may be unable or unwilling to comply with clinical trial protocols. For example, quarantines or other travel limitations (whether voluntary or required) have been implemented in many countries, and may impede participant movement, affect sponsor access to study sites, or interrupt healthcare services, which may negatively impact the execution of clinical trials. Significant delays or disruptions to our clinical trials could adversely affect our ability to timely initiate studies, conduct successful studies, obtain or maintain regulatory approvals, or commercialize our product candidates. • Manufacturing: A significant outbreak at one of our partner sites could lead to delays in the manufacturing of our products and product candidates. In addition, the need to prioritize rated orders issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency pursuant to the U.S. Defense Production Act could impact the manufacturing, supply chain and distribution of our products and product candidates. • Operations: On March 13, 2020, to protect the health of our employees and their families, and our communities, and in accordance with direction from state and local government authorities, we instituted mandatory work-from-home for all employees and contingent workers other than those who are facility-dependent. Our increased reliance on personnel working from home may negatively impact productivity or disrupt, delay or otherwise adversely impact our business. In addition, remote working could increase our cyber security risk. General protective measures put into place at various governmental levels, including quarantines, travel restrictions and business shutdowns, may also negatively affect our operations. Further, if the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic continues and our operations are adversely impacted, including due to an outbreak in a facility, we risk a delay, default and/or nonperformance under existing agreements. • Share Price: The extent and duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our stock price is uncertain. The COVID-19 pandemic may cause our stock price to be more volatile, and our ability to raise capital could be impaired. Any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and prospects. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our operations and those of our third-party partners will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the pandemic, additional or modified government actions, new information which emerges concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions taken to contain the virus or treat its impact, among others. In particular, the speed of the continued spread of COVID-19 globally, and the magnitude of interventions to contain the spread of the virus, will determine the impact of the pandemic on our operations. If we fail to comply with healthcare and other regulations, we could face substantial penalties and our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. As a manufacturer of pharmaceuticals, within the U.S., certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations will apply to or affect our business. The laws and regulations include: • federal healthcare anti-kickback law, which prohibit, among other things, persons from soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid; • federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, information or claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent; • the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which among other things, strictly regulates drug product and medical device marketing, prohibits manufacturers from marketing such products for off-label use and regulates the distribution of samples; • federal laws that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to report certain calculated product prices to the government or provide certain discounts or rebates to government authorities or private entities, often as a condition of reimbursement under government healthcare programs; -56- • the so-called “federal sunshine” law, which requires pharmaceutical and medical device companies to monitor and report certain financial interactions with teaching hospitals , physicians and certain non-physician practitioners to the federal government for re-disclosure to the public; and • state law equivalents of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third party payor, including commercial insurers, state laws regulating interactions between pharmaceutical manufactures and healthcare providers, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by federal laws, thus complicating compliance efforts. The number and complexity of both federal and state laws continues to increase, and additional governmental resources are being used to enforce these laws and to prosecute companies and individuals who are believed to be violating them. We anticipate that government scrutiny of pharmaceutical sales and marketing practices will continue for the foreseeable future and subject us to the risk of government investigations and enforcement actions. We have implemented a compliance program, which is based on industry best practices and is designed to ensure that our activities comply with all applicable laws, regulations and industry standards. While our compliance program is intended to detect and prevent potential non-compliance, we cannot be certain that compliance will be assured. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other laws, rules or regulations that apply to us, we will be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Responding to government investigations, defending any claims raised, and any resulting fines, restitution, damages and penalties, settlement payments or administrative actions, as well as any related actions brought by stockholders or other third parties, could have a material impact on our reputation, business and financial condition and divert the attention of our management from operating our business. Even if we successfully defend against an action against us for violation of a law, the action and our defense could nonetheless cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state privacy, security, fraud and reporting laws may prove costly. If we, our collaborators, or any third-party manufacturers engaged by us or our collaborators fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could harm our business. We, our collaborators, and any third-party manufacturers we engage are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the generation, handling, use, storage, treatment, manufacture, transportation and disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous materials and wastes, as well as laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety, including those governing laboratory procedures, exposure to blood-borne pathogens and the handling of bio-hazardous materials. Our operations involve the use of hazardous materials, including organic and inorganic solvents and reagents. Although we believe that our activities conform in all material respects with such environmental laws, there can be no assurance that violations of these laws will not occur in the future as a result of human error, accident, equipment failure or other causes. Liability under environmental, health and safety laws can be joint and several and without regard to fault or negligence. The failure to comply with past, present or future laws could result in the imposition of substantial fines and penalties, remediation costs, property damage and personal injury claims, loss of permits or a cessation of operations, and any of these events could harm our business and financial condition. We expect that our operations will be affected by other new environmental, health and workplace safety laws on an ongoing basis, and although we cannot predict the ultimate impact of any such new laws, they may impose greater compliance costs or result in increased risks or penalties, which could harm our business. Further, with respect to the operations of any current or future collaborators or third party contract manufacturers, it is possible that if they fail to operate in compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or properly dispose of wastes associated with our product or product candidates, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, suffer reputational harm or experience a disruption in the manufacture and supply of our product or product candidates. -57- Comprehensive tax reform in the U.S. and future guidance could adversely affect our business and financial condition. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”) was enacted on December 22, 2017 in the U.S. The TCJA contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, elimination of U.S. tax on foreign earnings (subject to certain important exceptions), one-time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense, immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits. On March 27, 2020, President Trump signed into law the “Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act” or the CARES Act, which included certain changes in tax law intended to stimulate the U.S. economy in light of the COVID-19 outbreak, including temporary beneficial changes to the treatment of net operating losses, interest deductibility limitations and payroll tax matters. We continue to monitor for legislative developments, issuance of regulations and technical memorandum to provide further clarification and/or interpretations of the TCJA, as modified by the CARES Act. President Biden has provided informal guidance on tax law changes he may support. Among other things, his proposals would raise the rate on both domestic and foreign income. If these proposals are ultimately enacted into legislation, they could materially impact our tax provision, cash tax liability and effective tax rate. Our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset future taxable income may be limited as a result of future transactions involving our common stock. In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, a corporation that undergoes an ‘‘ownership change’’ is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses and certain other tax assets to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders increases by more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders’ lowest percentage ownership during the testing period, which is generally three years. An ownership change could limit our ability to utilize our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for taxable years including or following such “ownership change.” Limitations imposed on the ability to use net operating losses and tax credits to offset future taxable income could require us to pay U.S. federal income taxes earlier than we estimated or than would have otherwise been required if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such net operating losses and tax credits to expire unused, in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such net operating losses and tax credits and potentially adversely affecting our financial position. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes. We are winding down our expired U.S. government contracts, and the U.S. government may deny payment of some or all of the currently outstanding amounts owed to us. In addition, further development of our infectious disease programs may be limited by the intellectual property and other rights retained by the U.S. government. We have historically relied on U.S. government contracts and awards to fund and support certain infectious disease development programs. These contracts are expired and we are currently involved in contract close-out activities. The U.S. government has the right to perform additional audits prior to making final payment of costs and fees. If we are not able to adequately support costs incurred or other government requirements, the government may deny payment of some or all of the currently outstanding amounts owed to us. In addition, the U.S. government may have the right to develop all or some parts of product candidates that we have developed under a U.S. government contract after such contract has terminated or expired. Our employees, principal investigators, consultants and strategic partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading. We are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees, principal investigators, consultants and strategic partners. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional failures to comply with the regulations of the FDA and non-U.S. regulators, provide accurate information to the FDA and non-U.S. regulators, comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. We adopted a code of conduct applicable to all of our employees, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions. -58- Risks Related to our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements We have incurred operating losses since our inception and we may not achieve or sustain profitability. We incurred an operating loss of $564.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our accumulated deficit was $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2020. Although we currently have two commercially approved products in the U.S., we believe that it will take us some time to attain profitability and positive cash flow from operations. Since our products and product candidates target small patient populations, the per-patient drug pricing must be high in order to recover our development and manufacturing costs, fund adequate patient support programs, fund additional research and achieve profitability. We may be unable to maintain or obtain sufficient sales volumes at a price high enough to justify our product development efforts and our sales, marketing and manufacturing expenses. We have generally incurred expenses related to research and development of our technologies and product candidates and from general and administrative expenses that we have incurred while building our business infrastructure. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if and/or as we: • continue the commercialization of our products in the U.S.; • expand the global footprint of our products outside of the U.S.; • establish our sales, marketing and distribution capabilities; • continue our research, pre-clinical and clinical development of our product candidates; • respond to and satisfy requests and requirements from regulatory authorities in connection with development and potential approval of our product candidates; • initiate additional clinical trials for our product candidates; • seek marketing approvals for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; • acquire or in-license other product candidates; • maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; • increase manufacturing capabilities, including capital expenditures related to our real estate facilities and entering into manufacturing agreements; • hire additional clinical, quality control and scientific personnel; and • add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and planned future commercialization efforts. As a result, we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses at least through 2021. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing biopharmaceutical products, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when, or if, we will become profitable. We will need to raise additional funding, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed may force us to delay, limit or terminate our product development efforts or other operations. We will likely require additional capital from time to time in the future in order to meet FDA post-marketing approval requirements and market and sell our products as well as to continue the development of product candidates in our pipeline, to prepare for potential commercialization of our product candidates, to expand our product portfolio and to continue or enhance our business development efforts. The actual amount of funds that we may need and the sufficiency of the capital we have or are able to raise will be determined by many factors, some of which are in our control and others that are beyond our control. While we are currently well capitalized, we may use available capital resources sooner than we expect under our current operating plan. In addition, our operating plan may change. We may need or choose to seek additional funds sooner than planned, through equity or debt financings, government or other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements or a combination of these approaches. In any event, we expect to require additional capital to expand future development efforts, obtain regulatory approval for, and to commercialize, our product candidates. Raising funds in the current economic environment may present additional challenges. Even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans, we may seek additional capital if market conditions are favorable or in light of specific strategic considerations. -59- Any additional fundraising efforts may divert our management from their day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates. In addition, we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In the event we receive negative data from our key clinical programs or encounter other major setbacks in our development , manufacturing or regulatory activities or in our commercialization efforts, our stock price is likely to decline , which would make a future financing more difficult. Moreover, the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders. The issuance of additional securities, whether equity or debt, by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our shares to decline. The sale of additional equity or convertible securities may dilute all of our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness may result in increased fixed payment obligations and we may be required to agree to certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. We could also be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or otherwise at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable and we may be required to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product candidates or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects. If we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, we may be required to significantly curtail, delay or discontinue one or more of our research or development programs or the commercialization of any product, if approved, or be unable to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, as desired, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Raising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights. We may seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations and strategic and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of common stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock, the ownership interest of our stockholders in our company may be diluted. In addition, the terms of any such securities may include liquidation or other preferences that materially adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may increase our fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaboration, strategic partnerships and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our product candidates, our intellectual property, future revenue streams or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. The estimates and judgments we make, or the assumptions on which we rely, in preparing our consolidated financial statements could prove inaccurate. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the amounts of charges accrued by us and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Such estimates and judgments include revenue recognition, inventory, valuation of stock-based awards, research and development expenses and income tax. We base our estimates on historical experience, facts and circumstances known to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We cannot provide assurances, however, that our estimates, or the assumptions underlying them, will not change over time or otherwise prove inaccurate. If this is the case, we may be required to restate our consolidated financial statements, which could, in turn, subject us to securities class action litigation. Defending against such potential litigation relating to a restatement of our consolidated financial statements would be expensive and would require significant attention and resources of our management. Moreover, our insurance to cover our obligations with respect to the ultimate resolution of any such litigation may be inadequate. As a result of these factors, any such potential litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cause our stock price to decline, which could in turn subject us to securities class action litigation. -60- Risks Related to Our Common Stock Our stock price is volatile and may fluctuate due to factors beyond our control. The market prices for and trading volumes of securities of biotechnology companies, including our securities, has historically been volatile. Our stock has had significant swings in trading prices, in particular in connection with our public communications regarding feedback received from regulatory authorities. For example, over the last twelve months, as of the date of this report, our stock has increased as much as 11% in a single day or decreased as much as 51% in a single day. The market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors, including but not limited to: • the commercial performance of our products in the U.S.; • the timing of our submissions to regulatory authorities and regulatory decisions and developments; • positive or negative clinical trial results or regulatory interpretations of data collected in clinical trials conducted by us, our strategic partners, our competitors or other companies with investigational drugs targeting the same, similar or related diseases to those targeted by us; • delays in beginning and completing pre-clinical and clinical trials for potential product candidates; • delays in entering or failing to enter into strategic relationships with respect to development and/or commercialization of our products or product candidates or entry into strategic relationships on terms that are not deemed to be favorable to us; • technological innovations, product development or additional commercial product introductions by ourselves or competitors; • changes in applicable government regulations or regulatory requirements in the approval process; • developments concerning proprietary rights, including patents and patent litigation matters, such as developments in the interferences declared by the USPTO, including in the near term any outcomes of ongoing interference proceedings and over the longer term the outcomes from any related appeals; • public concern relating to the commercial value, efficacy or safety of any of our products; • our ability to obtain funds, through the issuance of equity or equity linked securities or incurrence of debt, or other corporate transactions; • comments by securities analysts; • developments in litigation against us; • changes in senior management; or • general market conditions in our industry or in the economy as a whole. Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of a company’s stock, including ours, regardless of actual operating performance. For example, the trading prices of biopharmaceutical companies have been highly volatile as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which continues to rapidly evolve. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources. Our revenues and operating results could fluctuate significantly, which may adversely affect our stock price. Our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from year-to-year and quarter-to-quarter as well as in comparison to the corresponding quarter of the preceding year. Variations my result from one or more factors, including, without limitation: • timing of purchase orders; • changes in coverage and reimbursement policies of health plans and other health insurers, especially in relation to those products that are currently manufactured, under development or identified for future development by us; • re-authorizations processes that may be required for patients who initially obtained coverage by third parties, including government payors, managed care organizations and private health insurers; • transition from temporary billing codes established by the CMS to permanent medical codes; • timing of approval of applications filed with the FDA; -61- • timing of product launches and market acceptance of products launched; • changes in the amounts spent to research, develop, acquire, license or promote new and existing products; • results of clinical trial programs; • serious or unexpected health or safety concerns with our product or product candidates and any resulting clinical holds; • introduction of new products by others that render one or more of our products obsolete or noncompetitive; • the ability to maintain selling prices and gross margins on our products; • increases in the cost of raw materials contained within our products and product candidates; • manufacturing and supply interruptions, including product rejections or recalls due to failure to comply with manufacturing specifications; • timing of revenue recognition relating to our distribution agreements; • the ability to protect our intellectual property from being acquired by other entities; • the ability to avoid infringing the intellectual property of others; • the continued impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; and • the addition or loss of customers. In addition, in one or more future periods, our results of operations may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline. Provisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law might deter acquisition bids for us that might be considered favorable and prevent or frustrate any attempt to replace or remove the then-current management and board of directors. Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or effect a change in our board of directors and management. These provisions include: • when the board is comprised of six or more directors, classification of our board of directors into two classes, with one class elected each year; • directors may only be removed for cause by the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of voting stock; • prohibition of cumulative voting of shares in the election of directors; • right of the board of directors to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death, disqualification or removal of a director; • express authorization of the board of directors to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; • prohibition on stockholder action by written consent; • advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings; • the ability of our board of directors to authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms and rights of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, including rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock; and • a super-majority (66 2/3%) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock are required to amend, rescind, alter or repeal our bylaws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation. In addition, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws and in the Delaware General Corporation Law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by the then-current board of directors. -62- A significant number of shares of our common stock are issuable pursuant to outstanding stock awards, and we expect to issue additional stock awards and shares of common stock to attract and retain employees, directors and consultants. We may also issue shares of common stock to finance our operations and in connection with our strategic goals . Exercise of these awards and sales of shares will dilute the interests of existing security holders and may depress the price of our common stock. Currently, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 198.0 million shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2020, there were approximately 79.4 million shares of common stock outstanding and outstanding awards to purchase 8.8 million shares of common stock under various incentive stock plans. Additionally, as of December 31, 2020, there were approximately 5.8 million shares of common stock available for future issuance under our 2018 Equity Incentive Plan, approximately 0.5 million shares of common stock available for issuance under our Amended and Restated 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and approximately 1.4 million shares of common stock available for issuance under our 2014 Employment Commencement Incentive Plan. We may issue additional shares to grant equity awards to our employees, officers, directors and consultants under our 2018 Equity Incentive Plan, our 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan or our 2014 Employment Commencement Incentive Plan. We may also issue additional common stock and warrants from time to time to finance our operations and in connection with strategic transactions, such as acquisitions and licensing. For example, in February 2020, we issued and sold 2,522,227 shares of common stock to Roche Finance in connection with the entry into the collaboration agreement with Roche. The issuance of additional shares of common stock or warrants to purchase common stock and the perception that such issuances may occur or exercise of outstanding warrants or stock options may have a dilutive impact on other stockholders and could have a material negative effect on the market price of our common stock. Future sales of our common stock in the public market could cause our share price to fall. Sales of a substantial number of our common stock in the public market, including sales by members of our management or board of directors, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity or equity-related securities. Risks Related to Our Credit Agreement and Convertible Senior Notes Our indebtedness resulting from our credit agreement could adversely affect our financial condition or restrict our future operations. On December 13, 2019, we entered into a loan agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with BioPharma Credit PLC, as the collateral agent and a lender (“BioPharma”), and BioPharma Credit Investments V (Master) LP, as a lender (together with BioPharma in its capacity as a lender, and each of their respective successors and assigns at any time party to the Credit Agreement, the “Lenders” and each a “Lender”) that provides for a senior secured term loan facility (the “Loan Facility”) of up to $500.0 million to be funded in two tranches: (i) a Tranche A Loan in an aggregate principal amount of $250.0 million (the “Tranche A Loan”), which was funded on December 20, 2019; and (ii) a Tranche B Loan in an aggregate principal amount of up to $250.0 million (the “Tranche B Loan”, and together with the Tranche A Loan, the “Term Loans”). We drew the $250.0 million Tranche A Loan in full on December 20, 2019. On September 24, 2020, we entered into a first amendment to loan agreement (the “Amendment”) which amends the Credit Agreement. The Amendment increases the aggregate principal amount of the Tranche B Loan under the Loan Facility from $250.0 million to $300.0 million. On November 2, 2020, we drew the $300.0 million Tranche B Loan. In addition, the Amendment extends the maturity date for the Tranche B Loan to December 31, 2024 and increases the funding fee payable to each Lender providing a portion of the Tranche B Loan on the date the Tranche B Loan is funded by 120 basis points to 2.95%. All obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured pursuant to the terms of a security agreement and subject to certain exceptions, by security interests in certain collateral (collectively, the “Collateral”), which includes the following: (1) any and all U.S. intellectual property owned by, and rights to U.S. intellectual property licensed to, us relating to any pharmaceutical composition in which eteplirsen or golodirsen is indicated to be administered for use in the treatment of DMD in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 51 or 53 skipping, respectively, or for any other use approved by the FDA (the “Loan Products”), (2) 100% of the equity interests directly held by us in certain wholly owned domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the equity interests in certain other wholly owned domestic subsidiaries, and (3) all of our personal property, including, without limitation, cash held in all our deposit accounts. Any non-U.S. intellectual property related to the Loan Products and intellectual property unrelated in any way to the Loan Products anywhere are not part of the Collateral. -63- The Credit Agreement contains negative covenants that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, restrict our ability to: • sell or dispose of assets, including certain intellectual property; • amend, modify or waive certain material agreements or organizational documents; • consolidate or merge; • incur additional indebtedness; • incur additional liens on the Collateral; • pay dividends or make any distribution or payment on or redeem, retire or purchase any equity interests; and • make payments of certain subordinated indebtedness. The Credit Agreement requires us to have consolidated liquidity of at least $100.0 million as of the last day of each month. Additionally, the Credit Agreement contains certain representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and provisions relating to events of default, which include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) nonpayment of principal, interest and other amounts; (ii) failure to comply with covenants; (iii) the occurrence of a material adverse change in (A) our ability to fulfill the payment or performance obligations under the Credit Agreement and related documents or (B) the binding nature of the Credit Agreement and related documents; (iv) the rendering of judgments or orders or the acceleration or payment default by us in respect of other indebtedness in excess of $10.0 million; and (v) certain insolvency and ERISA events. A change of control triggers a mandatory prepayment of the Term Loans, and we may not have sufficient funds or the ability to raise the funds necessary to prepay them. Servicing our Credit Agreement and 1.50% notes due 2024 (the “Notes”) requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow to pay our debt. In 2017, we issued $570.0 million aggregate principal amount of Notes, pursuant to that certain indenture, dated as of November 14, 2019, between us, as issuer, and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness, including the Credit Agreement and the Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to many factors, including, economic, financial, competitive and other, beyond our control. We do not expect our business to be able to generate cash flow from operations in the foreseeable future, sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures and we may therefore be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance the term loan under the Credit Agreement, which matures in 2023 and the Notes, which are non-callable and mature in 2024, will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations, and limit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business. We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to repurchase the Notes as required upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to repurchase the Notes. Holders of the Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their Notes for cash upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. A fundamental change may also constitute an event of default or prepayment under, and result in the acceleration of the maturity of, our then-existing indebtedness. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient financial resources, or will be able to arrange financing, to pay the fundamental change repurchase price in cash with respect to any Notes surrendered by holders for repurchase upon a fundamental change. In addition, restrictions under our then existing credit facilities or other indebtedness, if any, may not allow us to repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change. Our failure to repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change when required would result in an event of default with respect to the Notes which could, in turn, constitute a default under the terms of our other indebtedness, if any. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Notes. Capped call transactions entered into in connection with the Notes may impact the value of our common stock. In connection with the Notes, we entered into capped call transactions (the “Capped Call Transactions”) with certain financial institutions. The Capped Call Transactions are expected to generally reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the Notes into shares of our common stock. -64- In connection with establishing their initial hedges of the C apped C all T ransactions, these financial institutions or their respective affiliates entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock and/or to purchase our common stock. The financial institutions, or their respective affiliates, may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Notes. This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the Notes, which could affect the value of our common stock . General Risks We may be subject to product liability claims and our insurance may not be adequate to cover damages. The current and future use of our product candidates by us and our collaborators in clinical trials, expanded access programs, the sale of our products, or the use of our products under emergency use vehicles may expose us to liability claims inherent to the manufacture, clinical testing, marketing and sale of medical products. These claims might be made directly by consumers or healthcare providers or indirectly by pharmaceutical companies, our collaborators or others selling such products. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, we may experience financial losses in the future due to such product liability claims. We have obtained commercial general liability insurance coverage for our clinical trials and the sale of commercial products. However, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against all losses. If a successful product liability claim or series of claims is brought against us for uninsured liabilities or in excess of insured liabilities, our assets may not be sufficient to cover such claims and our business operations could be impaired. Violation of the General Data Protection Regulation could subject us to significant fines. The GDPR increases our obligations with respect to clinical trials conducted in the member states of the EEA by expanding the definition of personal data to include coded data and requiring changes to informed consent practices and more detailed notices for clinical trial subjects and investigators. In addition, the GDPR increases the scrutiny that clinical trial sites located in the EEA should apply to transfers of personal data from such sites to countries that are considered to lack an adequate level of data protection, such as the U.S. The GDPR imposes substantial fines for breaches of data protection requirements, which can be up to four percent of global revenue or 20 million Euros, whichever is greater, and it also confers a private right of action on data subjects for breaches of data protection requirements. Compliance with these directives will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase our cost of doing business, and despite those efforts, there is a risk that we may be subject to fines and penalties, litigation and reputational harm in connection with our European activities. If we fail to retain our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional qualified personnel, our future growth and our ability to compete would suffer. We are highly dependent on the efforts and abilities of the principal members of our senior management. Additionally, we have scientific personnel with significant and unique expertise in RNA-targeted therapeutics and gene therapy technologies. The loss of the services of any one of the principal members of our managerial team or staff may prevent us from achieving our business objectives. The competition for qualified personnel in the biotechnology field is intense, and our future success depends upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate such personnel. In order to develop and commercialize our products successfully, we will be required to retain key management and scientific employees. In certain instances, we may also need to expand or replace our workforce and our management ranks. In addition, we rely on certain consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in the formulation and advancement of our research and development programs. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by other entities or have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with third parties that limit their availability to us, or both. If we are unable to attract, assimilate or retain such key personnel, our ability to advance our programs would be adversely affected. In the second half of 2020, we announced several executive management changes. Leadership transitions can be inherently difficult to manage and may cause uncertainty or a disruption to our business or may increase the likelihood of turnover in other key officers and employees. If we lose the services of one or more of our senior management or key employees, or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise to compete with us, our business could be harmed. -65- We have expanded, and may continue to expand, our organization and may experience difficulties in managing this growth, which could disrupt our operations. To support the expansion of our business activities, we have expanded, and may continue to expand, our full-time employee base, as well as our consultant and contractor base. Our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. Our ability to manage our growth properly and maintain compliance with all applicable rules and regulations will require us to continue to improve our operational, legal, financial and management controls, as well as our reporting systems and procedures. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Our growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of additional product candidates. If our management is unable to effectively manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate and/or grow revenues could be reduced, and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally. We are increasing our presence in international markets, including emerging markets, subjecting us to many risks that could adversely affect our business and revenues, such as: • the inability to obtain necessary foreign regulatory or pricing approvals of products in a timely manner; • uncertainties regarding the collectability of accounts receivable; • fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that may adversely impact our revenues, net income and value of certain of our investments; • difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; • the imposition of governmental controls; • less favorable intellectual property or other applicable laws; • increasingly complex standards for complying with foreign laws and regulations that may differ substantially from country to country and may conflict with corresponding U.S. laws and regulations; • the far-reaching anti-bribery and anti-corruption legislation in the U.K., including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, and elsewhere and escalation of investigations and prosecutions pursuant to such laws; • compliance with complex import and export control laws; • restrictions on direct investments by foreign entities and trade restrictions; and • changes in tax laws and tariffs. In addition, our international operations are subject to regulation under U.S. law. For example, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from paying, offering to pay, promising to pay or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to otherwise obtain favorable treatment or influence a person working in an official capacity. In many countries, the healthcare professionals we regularly interact with may meet the FCPA's definition of a foreign government official. Failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences, including: possible delay in approval or refusal to approve a product, recalls, seizures or withdrawal of an approved product from the market, disruption in the supply or availability of our products or suspension of export or import privileges, the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions, the prosecution of executives overseeing our international operations and damage to our reputation. Any significant impairment of our ability to sell products outside of the U.S. could adversely impact our business and financial results. Unfavorable global economic conditions could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our results of operations could be harmed by general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets. A severe or prolonged economic downturn could result in a variety of risks to our business, including weakened demand for our product candidates and our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. A weak or declining economy could strain our manufacturers, possibly resulting in manufacturing disruption, or cause delays in payments for our services by third-party payors or our future collaborators. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the current economic climate and financial market conditions could harm our business. -66- Additionally, in June 2016, a majority of United Kingdom ( “ UK ” ) voters voted for the UK to exit the EU (Brexit) and , on January 31, 2020 , the UK’s withdrawal became effective . A transition period applied until the end of 2020 during which the pre-Brexit legal regime continued to apply. E xisting EU Treaties, EU free movement rights and the general principles of EU law now no longer apply in relation to the UK. EU regulations only continue to apply in UK domestic law (by virtue of the European Union Withdrawal Act of 2018) to the extent that they are not modified or revoked by regulations under that Act. The EU and the UK negotiating teams have agreed the terms of a detailed post-Brexit Trade and Cooperation Agreement which has been given effect from 1st of January 2021. The economic effects of Brexit will depend the implementation of this Trade and Cooperating Agreement . Brexit could adversely affect European and worldwide economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial markets. Brexit is likely to lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the UK determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. We may face new regulatory costs and challenges as a result of Brexit that could have a material adverse effect on our operations. For example, as of January 1, 2021, the United Kingdom lost the benefits of global trade agreements negotiated by the European Union on behalf of its members, which may result in increased trade barriers that could make our doing business in areas that are subject to such global trade agreements more difficult. Any of these effects of Brexit, and any other effects we cannot anticipate, could adversely affect our business, business opportunities, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting the global economy, and the U.S. economy in particular, with the potential for any economic downturn to be severe and prolonged. A severe or prolonged economic downturn as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could result in a variety of risks to our business, including disruptions in the financial markets, which could adversely impact our ability to raise additional capital when needed or on acceptable terms, if at all. We rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology, including any cyber security incidents, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of the patients using our commercially approved products, clinical trial participants and employees. Similarly, our third-party providers possess certain of our sensitive data. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information, including our data being breached at third party providers, could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt our operations and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business. We may incur substantial costs in connection with litigation and other disputes. In the ordinary course of business we may, and in some cases have, become involved in lawsuits and other disputes such as securities claims, intellectual property challenges, including interferences declared by the USPTO, and employee matters. It is possible that we may not prevail in claims made against us in such disputes even after expending significant amounts of money and company resources in defending our positions in such lawsuits and disputes. The outcome of such lawsuits and disputes is inherently uncertain and may have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The increasing use of social media platforms presents new risks and challenges. Social media is increasingly being used to communicate about our products, technologies and programs, and the diseases our product and product candidates are designed to treat. Social media practices in the biopharmaceutical industry continue to evolve and regulations relating to such use are not always clear. This evolution creates uncertainty and risk of noncompliance with regulations applicable to our business. For example, patients may use social media channels to comment on the effectiveness of a product or to report an alleged adverse event. When such disclosures occur, there is a risk that we fail to monitor and comply with applicable adverse event reporting obligations or we may not be able to defend ourselves or the public's legitimate interests in the face of the political and market pressures generated by social media due to restrictions on what we may say about our product and/or product candidates. There is also a risk of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information or negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us on any social networking website. If any of these events were to occur or we otherwise fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could incur liability, face overly restrictive regulatory actions or incur other harm to our business. -67- We or the third parties upon whom we depend may be adversely affected by natural disasters and/or terrorism attack s , and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster. Natural disasters could severely disrupt our operations, and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. If a natural disaster, power outage, terrorism attack or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our office, manufacturing and/or lab spaces, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as the manufacturing facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place may prove inadequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None. Item 2. Properties. A description of the facilities we own and/or occupy is included in the following table. We believe that our current facilities in Cambridge, Andover and Burlington, Massachusetts and Columbus, Ohio are suitable and will provide sufficient capacity to meet the projected needs of our business for the next 12 months.

This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Please review our legend titled “Forward-Looking Information” at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K which is incorporated herein by reference. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below, and those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Throughout this discussion, unless the context specifies or implies otherwise, the terms “Sarepta”, “we”, “us” and “our” refer to Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. and its subsidiaries. This section discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 have been excluded from this Form 10-K and can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. Overview We are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on helping patients through the discovery and development of unique RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene therapy and other genetic therapeutic modalities for the treatment of rare diseases. Applying our proprietary, highly-differentiated and innovative technologies, and through collaborations with our strategic partners, we are developing potential therapeutic candidates for a broad range of diseases and disorders, including DMD, LGMDs, and other CNS related disorders. Our first commercial product, EXONDYS 51, was granted accelerated approval by the FDA on September 19, 2016. EXONDYS 51 is indicated for the treatment of DMD in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 51 skipping. EXONDYS 51 uses our PMO chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 51 of the dystrophin gene. Our second commercial product, VYONDYS 53, was granted accelerated approval by the FDA on December 12, 2019. VYONDYS 53 is indicated for the treatment of DMD in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 53 skipping. VYONDYS 53 uses our PMO chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 53 of the dystrophin gene. Our third commercial product, AMONDYS 45, was granted accelerated approval by the FDA on February 25, 2021. AMONDYS 45 is indicated for the treatment of DMD in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 45 skipping. AMONDYS 45 uses our PMO chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 45 of the dystrophin gene. A summary description of our key product candidates, including those in collaboration with our strategic partners, is as follows: • SRP-5051 uses our next-generation chemistry platform, PPMO, and our exon-skipping technology to skip exon 51 of the dystrophin gene. SRP-5051, a peptide conjugated PMO, is designed to bind to exon 51 of dystrophin pre-mRNA, resulting in exclusion of this exon during mRNA processing in patients with genetic mutations that are amenable to exon 51 skipping. Exon skipping is intended to promote the production of an internally truncated but functional dystrophin protein. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we commenced a first-in-human, single ascending dose, study for the treatment of DMD in patients who are amenable to exon 51 skipping. In 2019, we commenced Study 5051-201. In December 2020, we announced an interim analysis on clinical results from the 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg dose cohorts of Part A of Study 5051-201. We expect to announce results from the next cohort of Part A of Study 5051-201 at 30 mg/kg in the second quarter of 2021. • SRP-9001 (DMD, micro-dystrophin gene therapy program) , aims to express micro-dystrophin – a smaller but still functional version of dystrophin. A unique, engineered micro-dystrophin is used because naturally-occurring dystrophin is too large to fit in an AAV vector. In the fourth quarter of 2017, an IND application for the micro-dystrophin gene therapy program was cleared by the FDA, and a Phase 1/2a clinical trial in individuals with DMD was initiated (Study 101). In October 2018, Nationwide presented results from the Phase 1/2a clinical trial in four individuals with DMD enrolled in the trial. In March 2019, we presented nine-month functional and creatine kinase (“CK”) data from baseline from these four individuals, and twelve-month CK data from baseline from one of these individuals. In June 2020, we announced that functional, safety and tolerability data at twelve-months from baseline from these four individuals had been published in JAMA Neurology. In September 2020, we presented functional, safety and tolerability data at 24 months from these four individuals. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we commenced a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of SRP-9001 with the goal to establish the functional benefits of micro-dystrophin expressions (Study 102). We dosed all 41 participants in Study 102 and have begun dosing participants in the crossover phase of the study. In January 2021, we released top-line results for Part 1 of Study 102 (the 48-week assessment of 41 participants) and interim expression results from Part 2 of Study 102 (the crossover phase). We expect additional results from Part 2 of Study 102 in the first quarter of 2022. We have commenced dosing in Study 103, an open-label study evaluating the safety and expression of commercially representative material for SRP-9001, and expect to report biomarker and safety results from Study 103 in the second quarter of 2021. -71- • SRP-9003 (LGMD, gene therapy program) . We are developing gene therapy programs for various forms of LGMDs. The most advanced of our LGMD product candidates, SRP-9003, is designed to transfer a gene that codes for and restores beta-sarcoglycan protein with the goal of restoring the dystrophin associated protein complex. It utilizes the AAVrh.74 vector system, the same vector used in the micro-dystrophin gene therapy program we are developing with Nationwide. A Phase 1/2a trial of SRP-9003 was commenced in the fourth quarter of 2018. In February 2019, we announced positive two-month biopsy data from the first three-patient low-dose cohort dosed in the SRP-9003 trial, and in October 2019, we announced positive nine-month functional data from these three patients. We have recently dosed one additional cohort of three patients at a higher dose per the study protocol. In June 2020, we announced safety and expression results from three clinical trial participants in the high-dose cohort measured at 60 days, and one-year functional data from three clinical trial participants in the low-dose cohort. In September 2020, we announced six-month functional data from three clinical trial participants in the high-dose cohort, and eighteen-month functional data from three clinical trial participants in the low-dose cohort. We expect to complete GMP runs for SRP-9003 in 2021. We also expect to seek FDA confirmation to initiate our pivotal trial in 2021. Our pipeline includes more than 40 programs in various stages of pre-clinical and clinical development, reflecting our multifaceted approach and expertise in precision genetic medicine to make a profound difference in the lives of patients suffering from rare diseases. We have developed proprietary state-of-the-art CMC and manufacturing capabilities that allow synthesis and purification of our products and product candidates to support both clinical development as well as commercialization. Our current main focus in manufacturing is to continue scaling up production of our PMO-based therapies and optimizing manufacturing for PPMO and gene therapy-based product candidates. We have entered into certain manufacturing and supply arrangements with third-party suppliers and will utilize these capabilities to support production of certain of our products and product candidates and their components. In 2017, we opened a facility in Andover, Massachusetts, which significantly enhanced our research and development manufacturing capabilities. However, we currently do not have internal large scale GMP manufacturing capabilities to produce our products and product candidates for commercial and/or clinical use. The likelihood of our long-term success must be considered in light of the expenses, difficulties and delays frequently encountered in the development and commercialization of new pharmaceutical products, competitive factors in the marketplace and the complex regulatory environment in which we operate. We may never achieve significant revenue or profitable operations. COVID-19 Pandemic The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a substantial public health and economic challenge around the world. Our business operations and financial condition and results have been impacted to varying degrees, and we expect the impact will continue in future quarters. Commercialization : We have activated business continuity plans to minimize disruption to patients. The response to COVID-19 by healthcare providers has made it difficult for some patients, especially those dependent on a hospital setting, to receive infusions or initiate treatment with our commercial products. In addition, as a result of the pandemic, some patients may choose to delay or stop treatment to avoid a visit to a hospital or a visit of a third party in their homes to minimize the risk of infection. The impact of COVID-19 may also result in delays in processing reauthorizations and modifications to program benefits by insurers, making it difficult for patients to obtain or maintain favorable coverage decisions for our products. In addition, the increase in unemployment due to the pandemic has resulted in decreased insurance coverage for many individuals. These challenges may continue for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is uncertain, and are expected to reduce our revenue and cash flows. Clinical Trials : The impact of COVID-19 has caused disruptions and may cause delays in some of our clinical trials. Missing data could undermine data integrity and probability of success. The response to COVID-19 by healthcare providers and regulatory agencies could delay the commencement of trials, site initiation, compliance in the trials, the completion of trials, including the completion of post-marketing requirements and commitments, slow down enrollment, and make the ongoing collection of data for patients enrolled in studies more difficult or intermittent. We are implementing certain strategy and technology in an attempt to mitigate this risk in the event of subsequent outbreaks. In addition, as COVID-19 continues to spread, some participants and clinical investigators may be unable or unwilling to comply with clinical trial protocols. For example, quarantines or other travel limitations (whether voluntary or required) have been implemented in many countries, and may impede participant movement, affect sponsor access to study sites, or interrupt healthcare services, which may negatively impact the execution of clinical trials. Significant delays or disruptions to our clinical trials could adversely affect our ability to timely initiate studies, conduct successful studies, obtain or maintain regulatory approvals, or commercialize our product candidates. -72- Operations : On March 13, 2020, to protect the health of our employees and their families, and our communities, and in accordance with direction from state and local government authorities, we instituted mandatory work-from-home for all employees and contingent workers other than those who are facility-dependent . Facility-dependent employees, including those needed to maintain manufacturing and clinical research, are reporting to work under strict protocols designed to help those employees remain healthy. Our increased reliance on personnel working from home may negatively impact productivity or disrupt, delay or otherwise adversely impact our business. To date, our remote working arrangements have not impacted our ability to maintain critical business operations. In addition, remote working could increase our cyber security risk. General protective measures put into place at various governmental levels, including quarantines, travel restrictions and business shutdowns, may also negatively affect our operations. Further, if the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic continues and our operations are adversely impacted, including due to an outbreak in a facility, we risk a delay, default and/or nonperformance under existing agreements. Manufacturing : A significant outbreak at one of our partner sites could lead to delays in the manufacturing of our products and product candidates. In addition, the need to prioritize rated orders issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency pursuant to the U.S. Defense Production Act could impact the manufacturing, supply chain and distribution of our products and product candidates. We are continuing to assess the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations and financial condition and results. Despite careful tracking and planning, however, we are unable to accurately predict the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business, results of operations and financial condition due to the uncertainty of future developments. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19, the actions taken to contain it or treat its impact and the economic impact on local, regional, national and international markets. For additional information on the various risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities for the periods presented. Some of these judgments can be subjective and complex, and, consequently, actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe that the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon historical experience and information available to us at the time that we make these estimates and judgments. To the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our consolidated financial statements will be affected. Although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate, actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: • revenue recognition; • valuation of product options; • i nventory; and • income tax. Revenue Recognition To determine revenue recognition for arrangements within the scope of ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), we perform the following five steps: (1) identify the contracts with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation. -73- Product Revenue Product revenues are recorded at the net sales price (transaction price) which includes estimated reserves for variable consideration, such as Medicaid rebates, governmental chargebacks, including PHS chargebacks, prompt payment discounts, co-pay assistance and distribution fees. These reserves are based on the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if no payment is required by us) or a current liability (if a payment is required by us). These reserves reflect our best estimates of the amount of consideration to which we are entitled based on the terms of the contracts. Additional details relating to variable consideration follows: • Medicaid rebates relate to our estimated obligations to states under established reimbursement arrangements. Rebate reserves are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a liability which is included in accrued expenses. • Governmental chargebacks, including PHS chargebacks, relate to our estimated obligations resulting from contractual commitments to sell products to qualified healthcare providers at prices lower than the list prices that we charge to wholesalers. The wholesaler charges us for the difference between what the wholesaler pays for the products and the ultimate selling price to the qualified healthcare providers. Chargeback reserves are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and accounts receivable. Chargeback amounts are generally determined at the time of resale to the qualified healthcare provider from the wholesaler, and we generally issue credits for such amounts within a few weeks of receiving notification of resale from the wholesaler. • Prompt payment discounts relate to our estimated obligations for credits to be granted to specialty pharmacies for remitting payment on their purchases within established incentive periods. Reserves for prompt payment discounts are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and accounts receivable. • Co-pay assistance relates to financial assistance provided to qualified patients, whereby we may assist them with prescription drug co-payments required by the patient’s insurance provider. Reserves for co-pay assistance are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a liability which is included in accrued expenses. • Distribution fees relate to fees paid to customers in the distribution channel that provide us with inventory management, data and distribution services and are generally accounted for as a reduction of revenue. To the extent that the services received are distinct from our sale of products to the customer, these payments are accounted for as selling, general and administrative expenses. Reserves for distribution fees result in an increase in a liability if payments are required of us or a reduction of accounts receivable if no payments are required of us. Please read Note 7, Accounts Receivable and Reserves for Product Sales to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of revenue recognition. Collaboration Revenue Our collaboration revenue is primarily generated from our collaboration arrangement with Roche. For more information, please read Note 3, Collaboration and License Agreements . At the inception of a collaboration arrangement, we first assess whether the contractual arrangement is within the scope of ASC Topic 808, Collaborative Arrangements (“ASC 808”), to determine whether the arrangement involves a joint operating activity and involves two (or more) parties that are both active participants in the activity and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of such activities. Then we determine whether the collaboration arrangement in its entirety represents a contract with a customer as defined by ASC 606. If only a portion of the collaboration arrangement is potentially with a customer, we apply the distinct good or service unit-of-account guidance in ASC 606 to determine whether there is a unit of account that should be accounted for under ASC 606. For the units of account in the collaboration arrangement that do not represent a vendor-customer relationship, we will (i) consider applying other GAAP, including by analogy, or (ii) if there is no appropriate analogy, consistently apply a reasonable and rational accounting policy election. In general, by analogy to ASC 606, we identify the performance obligations within the collaboration arrangement and identify and allocate the transaction price we expect to receive on a relative standalone selling price basis to each performance obligation. Variable consideration, consisting of development and regulatory milestones, will be included in the transaction price only if we expect to receive such consideration and if it is probable that the inclusion of the variable consideration will not result in a significant reversal in the cumulative amount of revenue recognized under the arrangement. Sales-based royalty and milestone payments are excluded from the transaction price we expect to receive until the underlying sales occur because the license to our intellectual property is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties or milestones relate as it is the primary driver of value in its collaboration arrangement. For the recognition of revenue associated with each performance obligation, if we determine ASC 606 is not appropriate to apply by analogy, we will apply a reasonable, rational, and consistently applied accounting policy election to faithfully depict the transfer of services to the collaboration partner over the estimated performance period. Up-front payments from a collaboration partner are recognized as deferred revenue when received and recognized as revenue over the estimated performance period. Reimbursement payments from a collaboration partner associated with research and development cost sharing provisions in a collaboration arrangement are recognized as the related expense is incurred and classified as an offset to research and development expense. -74- Valuation of Product Options Our collaboration arrangements may contain options which provide the collaboration partner with the right to obtain additional licenses. If an arrangement contains product options, by analogy to ASC 606, we evaluate the product options to determine whether they represent material rights, which may include options to acquire additional goods or services for free or at a discount. If the customer options are determined to represent material rights, they are recognized as a separate performance obligation at inception of the arrangement. We allocate a portion of the transaction price of the collaboration arrangement to material rights based on the relative standalone selling price. Amounts allocated to material rights are not recognized as revenue until related options are exercised or expire. Key assumptions to determine the standalone selling price of product options in a collaboration arrangement include, but are not limited to, forecasted revenues, development timelines, incremental costs related to the arrangement, discount rates and likelihood of technical and regulatory success. Inventory Valuation Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. We capitalize inventory costs associated with products following regulatory approval when future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized. EXONDYS 51 and VYONDYS 53 inventory that may be used in clinical development programs is charged to research and development expense when the product enters the research and development process and no longer can be used for commercial purposes. We periodically analyze our inventories for excess amounts or obsolescence and write down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value. Additionally, though our products are subject to strict quality control and monitoring, which we perform throughout the manufacturing processes, certain batches or units of product may not meet quality specifications resulting in a charge to cost of sales. Income Tax We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon an examination. The calculation of our tax liabilities resulting from uncertain tax positions can involve significant judgment. Further, the calculation may involve the application of complex tax regulations in a foreign jurisdiction. Although we believe that we have adequately provided for tax liabilities resulting from uncertain tax positions, the actual amounts paid, if any, could have a material impact on our results of operations. Interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions are classified as a component of income tax expense. Please read Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates. -75- The following table sets forth selected consolidated statements of operations data for each of the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 Change Change (in thousands, except per share amounts) $ % Revenues: Products, net $ 455,865 $ 380,833 $ 75,032 20 % Collaboration 84,234 — 84,234 NM* Total revenues 540,099 380,833 159,266 42 % Cost and expenses: Cost of sales (excluding amortization of in-licensed rights) 63,382 56,586 6,796 12 % Research and development 722,343 560,909 161,434 29 % Selling, general and administrative 317,875 284,812 33,063 12 % Acquired in-process research and development — 173,240 (173,240 ) 0% Settlement and license charges — 10,000 (10,000 ) 0% Amortization of in-licensed rights 662 849 (187 ) (22 )% Total cost and expenses 1,104,262 1,086,396 17,866 2 % Operating loss (564,163 ) (705,563 ) 141,400 (20 )% Other income (loss): Gain from sale of Priority Review Voucher 108,069 — 108,069 NM* Loss on contingent consideration (45,000 ) — (45,000 ) NM* Other expense, net (51,971 ) (8,317 ) (43,654 ) NM* Total other income (loss) 11,098 (8,317 ) 19,415 (233 )% Loss before income tax expense (553,065 ) (713,880 ) 160,815 (23 )% Income tax expense 1,063 1,195 (132 ) (11 )% Net loss $ (554,128 ) $ (715,075 ) $ 160,947 (23 )% Net loss per share — basic and diluted $ (7.11 ) $ (9.71 ) $ 2.61 (27 )% * NM: not meaningful Revenues Net product revenues for our products for 2020 increased by $75.0 million compared with 2019. The increase primarily reflects the launch of a new product in December 2019 in the U.S., VYONDYS 53, and increasing demand for our products in the U.S. Collaboration revenue primarily relates to our collaboration arrangement with Roche. In February 2020, we received an aggregate of approximately $1.2 billion in cash consideration from Roche, consisting of an up-front payment and an equity investment in our company. Of that amount, $348.7 million is recorded as deferred revenue and is being recognized as collaboration revenue on a straight-line basis over the performance period, estimated to be through the fourth quarter of 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2020 we recognized $84.2 million of collaboration revenue. For more information, please read Note 3, Collaboration and License Agreements . There was no such transaction in 2019. Cost of sales (excluding amortization of in-licensed rights) Our cost of sales (excluding amortization of in-licensed rights) consists of royalty payments primarily to BioMarin and UWA and inventory costs that relate to sales of our products. Prior to receiving regulatory approval for EXONDYS 51 and VYONDYS 53 by the FDA in September 2016 and December 2019, respectively, we expensed such manufacturing and material costs as research and development expenses. For VYONDYS 53 sold in 2020 and 2019, the majority of related manufacturing costs incurred had previously been expensed as research and development expenses, as such costs were incurred prior to the FDA approval of the products. For EXONDYS 51 sold in 2020 and 2019, only part of the related manufacturing costs incurred had previously been expensed as research and development expenses. If product related costs had not previously been expensed as research and development expenses prior to FDA approval, the incremental inventory costs related to our products sold in 2020 and 2019 would have been approximately $25.9 million and $12.4 million, respectively. -76- Th e following table summarizes the components of our cost of sales for the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 Change Change (in thousands) $ % Inventory costs related to products sold $ 34,323 $ 33,663 $ 660 2 % Royalty payments 29,059 22,923 6,136 27 % Total cost of sales $ 63,382 $ 56,586 $ 6,796 12 % The cost of sales for 2020 increased $6.8 million, or 12%, compared with 2019. The increase was primarily driven by a $6.1 million increase in royalty payments to BioMarin and UWA that reflects increasing demand for our products. Research and development expenses Research and development expenses consist of costs associated with research activities as well as costs associated with our product development efforts, conducting pre-clinical trials, clinical trials and manufacturing activities. Direct research and development expenses associated with our programs include clinical trial site costs, clinical manufacturing costs, costs incurred for consultants, up-front fees and milestones paid to third parties in connection with technologies that have not reached technological feasibility and do not have an alternative future use, and other external services, such as data management and statistical analysis support, and materials and supplies used in support of clinical programs. Indirect costs of our clinical programs include salaries, stock-based compensation and allocation of our facility- and technology-related costs. Research and development expenses represent a substantial percentage of our total operating expenses. We do not maintain or evaluate and, therefore, do not allocate internal research and development costs on a project-by-project basis. As a result, a significant portion of our research and development expenses are not tracked on a project-by-project basis, as the costs may benefit multiple projects. The following table summarizes our research and development expenses by project for each of the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 Change Change (in thousands) $ % Micro-dystrophin $ 289,877 $ 84,490 $ 205,387 243 % Other gene therapies 67,650 38,720 28,930 75 % Casimersen (exon 45) 58,179 27,095 31,084 115 % Up-front, milestone, and other expenses 47,280 103,162 (55,882 ) (54 )% Golodirsen (exon 53) 36,650 21,390 15,260 71 % Eteplirsen (exon 51) 32,371 47,042 (14,671 ) (31 )% PPMO platform 31,633 19,082 12,551 66 % Collaboration cost-sharing 13,105 9,416 3,689 39 % Other projects 4,566 3,262 1,304 40 % Internal research and development expenses 206,912 207,250 (338 ) (0 )% Roche collaboration reimbursement (65,880 ) — (65,880 ) NM* Total research and development expenses $ 722,343 $ 560,909 $ 161,434 29 % * NM: not meaningful -77- The following table summarizes our research and development expenses by category for each of the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 Change Change (in thousands) $ % Manufacturing expenses $ 366,867 $ 142,937 $ 223,930 157 % Compensation and other personnel expenses 107,149 89,639 17,510 20 % Clinical expenses 95,367 79,241 16,126 20 % Facility- and technology-related expenses 55,372 46,556 8,816 19 % Up-front, milestone, and other expenses 47,280 103,162 (55,882 ) (54 )% Stock-based compensation 41,671 27,681 13,990 51 % Professional services 18,325 22,965 (4,640 ) (20 )% Collaboration cost-sharing 13,105 9,416 3,689 39 % Pre-clinical expenses 10,139 11,729 (1,590 ) (14 )% Research and other 32,948 27,583 5,365 19 % Roche collaboration reimbursement (65,880 ) — (65,880 ) NM* Total research and development expenses $ 722,343 $ 560,909 $ 161,434 29 % * NM: not meaningful Research and development expenses for 2020 increased by $161.4 million, or 29%, compared with 2019. The increase was primarily driven by the following: • $223.9 million increase in manufacturing expenses primarily due to a continuing ramp-up of our micro-dystrophin gene therapy program as well as other gene therapy programs in our pipeline; • $17.5 million increase in compensation and other personnel expenses primarily due to a net increase in headcount; • $16.1 million increase in clinical expenses primarily due to increased patient enrollment in our ESSENCE program as well as certain start-up activities for our micro-dystrophin program; • $8.8 million increase in facility- and technology-related expenses due to our continuing global expansion efforts; • $55.9 million decrease in up-front, milestone, and other expenses, primarily due to $9.3 million of milestone expense related to payments accrued to an academic institution and $38.0 million of up-front payments as a result of the execution of certain research, option and license agreements during 2020. This was offset primarily by $46.9 million of up-front payments to StrideBio and a $28.0 million up-front payment to Genethon as a result of the execution of a license and collaboration agreement with each company, respectively, and $25.6 million of up-front and milestone payments made to various academic institutions throughout 2019 ; • $14.0 million increase in stock-based compensation expense primarily driven by increases in headcount and stock price; • $4.6 million decrease in professional services primarily due to a decrease in reliance on third-party research and development contractors as a result of an increase in hiring and headcount ; • $3.7 million increase in collaboration cost-sharing with Genethon on its micro-dystrophin drug candidates and Lysogene on its Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA (“MPS IIIA”) drug candidate; • $1.6 million decrease in pre-clinical expenses primarily due to completion of certain toxicology studies in our PPMO platform, offset by an increase of toxicology studies in our gene therapy programs ; • $5.4 million increase in research and other primarily driven by an increase in sponsored research with academic institutions during 2020; and • $65.9 million offset to expense incurred during 2020 associated with a collaboration reimbursement from Roche related to the micro-dystrophin project. Selling, general and administrative expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and related costs for personnel in our executive, finance, legal, information technology, business development, human resources, commercial and other general and administrative functions. Other general and administrative expenses include an allocation of our facility- and technology-related costs and professional fees for legal, consulting and accounting services. -78- The following table summarizes our selling, general and administrative expenses by category for each of the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 Change Change (in thousands) $ % Professional services $ 106,571 $ 91,384 $ 15,187 17 % Compensation and other personnel expenses 105,233 105,998 (765 ) (1 )% Stock-based compensation 66,399 50,921 15,478 30 % Facility- and technology-related expenses 28,615 27,249 1,366 5 % Roche collaboration reimbursement (604 ) — (604 ) NM* Other 11,661 9,260 2,401 26 % Total selling, general and administrative expenses $ 317,875 $ 284,812 $ 33,063 12 % * NM: not meaningful Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2020 increased by $33.1 million, or 12%, compared with 2019. This was primarily driven by the following: • $15.2 million increase in professional services primarily due to continuing global expansion; • $15.5 million increase in stock-based compensation primarily due to increases in headcount and stock price ; and • $1.4 million increase in facility- and technology-related expense primarily due to continuing global expansion. Acquired in-process research and development As a result of the Myonexus acquisition, we recorded acquired in-process research and development expense of approximately $173.2 million during the second quarter of 2019. There was no such transaction during 2020 . Settlement and license charges In December 2019, we recognized a $10.0 million settlement charge related to contingent settlement payments to BioMarin as a result of the approval of VYONDYS 53. This was a result of a settlement and license agreement with BioMarin in July 2017. There was no such expense recognized during 2020. Amortization of in-licensed rights Amortization of in-licensed rights relates to the agreements we entered into with BioMarin and UWA in July 2017 and April 2011, respectively. We recorded an in-licensed right asset of approximately $6.6 million in 2017 as a result of the settlement and license agreements with BioMarin. Additionally, following the first sale of EXONDYS 51 in September 2016 and VYONDYS 53 in December 2019, we recorded an in-licensed right asset of $1.0 million and $0.5 million, respectively, related to the license agreement with UWA. Each in-licensed right is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the patent from the first commercial sale of each product. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recorded amortization of in-licensed rights of approximately $0.7 million and $0.8 million, respectively. Gain from sale of Priority Review Voucher In February 2020, we entered into an agreement with Vifor (International) Ltd. to sell the rare pediatric disease Priority Review Voucher (“PRV”) we received from the FDA in connection with the approval of VYONDYS 53. Following the early termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, in March 2020, we completed our sale of the PRV and received proceeds of $108.1 million, net of commission, which was recorded as a gain from sale of the PRV as it did not have a carrying value at the time of the sale. There was no similar activity during 2019. Loss on contingent consideration The loss on contingent consideration relates to the fair value adjustment of the Company’s contingent consideration derivative liability related to regulatory-related contingent payments to Myonexus selling shareholders as well as to academic institutions under separate license agreements that meet the definition of a derivative. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $45.0 million of expense to adjust the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities. There was no similar activity during 2019. For further information on our contingent considerations, please read Note 5, Fair Value Measurements. -79- Other expense , net Other expense, net, primarily consists of interest income on our cash, cash equivalents and investments, interest expense on our debt facilities, amortization of investment discount, and fair value adjustment from our investment in Lysogene. Our cash equivalents and investments consist of money market funds, government and government agency debt securities and certificates of deposit. Interest expense primarily includes interest accrued on our convertible notes and term loan. Other expense, net, for 2020 increased by approximately $43.7 million compared with 2019. The increase primarily reflected an increase in the interest expense on our debt facilities as well as a decrease in interest income and the amortization of investment discounts due to the investment mix of the Company’s investment portfolio . Income tax expense Income tax expense for 2020 and 2019 was approximately $1.1 million and $1.2 million, respectively. Income tax expense for all periods presented relate to state and foreign income taxes. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes our financial condition for each of the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 Change Change (in thousands) $ % Financial assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,502,648 $ 835,080 $ 667,568 80 % Short-term investments 435,923 289,668 146,255 50 % Restricted cash and investments 9,315 9,566 (251 ) (3 )% Total cash, cash equivalents and investments $ 1,947,886 $ 1,134,314 $ 813,572 72 % Borrowings: Term loan $ 527,731 $ 240,004 $ 287,727 120 % Convertible debt 464,762 441,896 22,866 5 % Total borrowings $ 992,493 $ 681,900 $ 310,593 46 % Working capital Current assets $ 2,485,196 $ 1,468,913 $ 1,016,283 69 % Current liabilities 416,026 264,767 151,259 57 % Total working capital $ 2,069,170 $ 1,204,146 $ 865,024 72 % For the year ended December 31, 2020, our principal sources of liquidity were primarily derived from our collaboration arrangement with Roche, net proceeds from draw-down of our debt facility, net proceeds from sale of the PRV and product sales of our products. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our principal source of liquidity was derived from proceeds from product sales of our products and debt and equity financings. Our principal uses of cash are research and development expenses, selling, general and administrative expenses, investments, capital expenditures, business development transactions and other working capital requirements. Our future expenditures and capital requirements may be substantial and will depend on many factors, including but not limited to the following: • our ability to continue to generate revenues from sales of EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53, and potential future products; • the timing and costs associated with our global expansion; • the timing and costs of building out our manufacturing capabilities; • the timing of advanced payments related to our future inventory commitments and manufacturing obligations; • the timing and costs associated with our clinical trials and pre-clinical trials; • the attainment of milestones and our obligations to make milestone payments to Myonexus’ selling shareholders, StrideBio, BioMarin, Lysogene, Lacerta, Nationwide, UWA and other institutions; -80- • repayment of outstanding debt; and • the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and our other intellectual property rights. Our cash requirements are expected to continue to increase as we advance our research, development and commercialization programs and we expect to seek additional financings primarily from, but not limited to, the sale and issuance of equity and debt securities, or the licensing or sale of our technologies or additional government contracts. We cannot provide assurances that financing will be available when and as needed or that, if available, the financings will be on favorable or acceptable terms. If we are unable to obtain additional financing when and if we require, this would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. To the extent we issue additional equity securities, our existing stockholders could experience substantial dilution. Cash Flows The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for each of the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 Change Change (in thousands) $ % Cash provided by (used in) Operating activities $ 107,466 $ (456,463 ) $ 563,929 (124 )% Investing activities (121,721 ) 286,725 (408,446 ) (142 )% Financing activities 682,323 642,554 39,769 6 % Increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 668,068 $ 472,816 $ 195,252 41 % Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities was $107.5 million for 2020. Cash used in operating activities for 2019 was $456.5 million. The favorable change was primarily driven by the following: • $749.4 million net increase in deferred revenue primarily as a result of the collaboration with Roche; • $45.0 million increase in the mark-to-market loss on the contingent consideration; • $29.5 million increase in stock-based compensation due to year-over-year increases in headcount and stock price; and • $18.3 million net increase in other non-cash adjustments. The increases were partially offset by: • $120.4 million increase in net loss excluding acquired in-process research and development expense, and the gain from the sale of the PRV, primarily driven by increases in research and development expense and selling, general and administrative expense partially offset by an increase in net product revenues and collaboration revenue; • $29.4 million decrease related to the issuance of common shares to StrideBio at no cost in 2019; • $14.6 million net increase in inventory primarily from our continuing build-up of inventory purchased in 2020 as the demand for our products increased; and • $113.8 million net increase in use of other operating assets and liabilities, excluding deferred revenue. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $121.7 million for 2020. Cash provided by investing activities for 2019 was $286.7 million. The unfavorable change was primarily due to the following: • $526.1 million decrease in proceeds from the maturity or sale of available-for-sale securities; • $139.9 million increase in purchase of available-for-sale securities; and • $22.6 million increase in purchase of property and equipment. -81- The decreases were partially offset by: • $172.6 million decrease in net payments as a result of the acquisition of Myonexus during 2019; and • $108.1 million increase in net proceeds from the sale of the PRV during 2020. Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities increased by $39.8 million for 2020 compared with 2019, primarily driven by the following: • $312.1 million increase in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock Roche; • $47.4 million increase in proceeds from the exercise of options and our employee stock purchase program; and • $45.5 million increase in net proceeds from debt financings. The increases were partially offset by: • $365.4 million decrease in net proceeds from the sale of common stock. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements During the periods presented, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or for another contractually narrow or limited purpose. Contractual Payment Obligations In our continuing operations, we have entered into long-term contractual arrangements from time to time for our facilities, the provision of goods and services, and issuance of debt securities, among others. The following table presents contractual obligations arising from these arrangements as of December 31, 2020: Payment Due by Period Total Less Than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3 - 5 Years More than 5 Years (in thousands) Debt obligations (1) $ 1,320,597 $ 55,949 $ 361,249 $ 903,399 $ — Lease obligations (2) 58,134 13,873 23,181 20,509 571 Manufacturing obligations (3) 1,294,435 632,257 316,097 207,864 138,217 Total contractual obligations $ 2,673,166 $ 702,079 $ 700,527 $ 1,131,772 $ 138,788 (1) Interest is included. (2) Lease obligations only include real estate leases that had commenced prior to December 31, 2020. The leases embedded in certain supply agreements are included in the manufacturing obligations caption. (3) Manufacturing obligations include agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding or subject to cancellation penalties and that specify all significant terms. Manufacturing obligations relate primarily to our commercialization of EXONDYS 51 and VYONDYS 53, and clinical programs for DMD as well as our gene therapy programs. Milestone Obligations For products and product candidates that are currently in various research and development stages, we may be obligated to make up to $3.9 billion of future development, regulatory, up-front royalty and sales milestone payments associated with our collaboration and license agreements. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable upon achievement of certain development, regulatory or commercial milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones is not probable and payment is not required as of December 31, 2020, such contingencies have not been recorded in our consolidated financial statements. Amounts related to contingent milestone payments are not yet considered contractual obligations as they are contingent on the successful achievement of certain development, regulatory approval and commercial milestones. -82- Other Funding Commitments We have several on-going clinical trials in various stages. Our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to contract research organizations (“CROs”). The CRO contracts are generally cancellable at our option. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $280.9 million in cancellable future commitments based on existing CRO contracts. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Please read Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Our current investment policy is to maintain a diversified investment portfolio consisting of money market investments, commercial paper, government and government agency bonds and high-grade corporate bonds with maturities of 36 months or less. Our cash is deposited in and invested through highly rated financial institutions in the United States. As of December 31, 2020, we had $1,947.8 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments, comprised of $1,502.6 million of cash and cash equivalents, $435.9 million short-term investments and $9.3 million of restricted cash and investments. The Company only holds debt securities classified as available-for-sale. The fair value of cash equivalents and short-term investments is subject to change as a result of potential changes in market interest rates. The potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments has been assessed on a hypothetical 10 basis point adverse movement across all maturities. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we estimate that such hypothetical adverse 10 basis point movement would result in a hypothetical loss in fair value of approximately $0.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively, to our interest rate sensitive instruments. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The information required by this Item 8 begins on page F-1 in Item 15 of Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is incorporated into this item by reference. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. Disclosure Controls and Procedures We carried out an evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to paragraph (b) of Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Based on that review, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act (1) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and (2) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control procedure, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control procedure are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. We considered these limitations during the development of our disclosure controls and procedures, and will continually reevaluate them to ensure they provide reasonable assurance that such controls and procedures are effective. -83- Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for our Company, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that: • pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; • provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and • provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in its 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on this assessment, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have not been material changes in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a–15(f) and 15d–15(f) under the Exchange Act for the quarter ended December 31, 2020 that our certifying officers concluded materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Page Number Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm F-2 Consolidated Balance Sheets F-5 Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss F-6 Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity F-7 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows F-8 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements F-9 F-1 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and Board of Directors Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc.: Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for leases as of January 1, 2019 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) . Basis for Opinions The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. F-2 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Evaluation of lower of cost or net realizable value of raw materials inventory As described in Note 2 and Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, approximately 31%, or $71.7 million, of the Company’s total inventory balance is comprised of raw materials. As discussed in Note 2, the Company periodically analyzes its raw materials inventories, and writes down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value. We identified the evaluation of lower of cost or net realizable value of raw materials inventory as a critical audit matter. The estimate of expected future demand for raw materials inventory is difficult to assess and results in the application of greater auditor judgment. Specifically, challenging auditor judgment was required to assess the potential impact the Company’s gene therapy technologies and competitor RNA-targeted therapeutic or gene therapy products could have on existing raw materials inventory. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s inventory valuation process, including controls related to the estimate of expected future demand for raw materials. We compared the Company’s prior period forecasted demand for raw materials to actual results to assess their ability to accurately estimate expected future demand. We evaluated clinical progress associated with the Company’s gene therapy technologies by inspecting internal meeting minutes and interviewing research and development personnel of the Company and assessed the potential impact of those technologies on expected future demand for raw materials inventory. We also read publicly available information to identify information regarding other competitor entities with RNA-targeted therapeutic or gene therapy products that could impact the Company’s estimates of expected future demand. Standalone selling prices of Options in the Roche Agreement As described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company entered into a license, collaboration and option agreement with F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd. (“Roche”) and a stock purchase agreement with an affiliate of Roche (collectively, the “Roche Agreement”) that became effective in February 2020. Obligations were identified in the Roche Agreement, including obligations associated with the grant of options to Roche to acquire ex-U.S. rights to certain future DMD-specific programs (the “Options”). The initial transaction price was $1.2 billion and $485.0 million was allocated to the Options based on their estimated standalone selling prices determined using an income approach of projected incremental discounted cash flows from each option. The discounted cash flows incorporate the likelihood of success of each individual product candidate associated with the Options and a discount rate. The transaction price allocated to the Options is recorded as deferred revenue and will not be recognized until an option is either: (i) exercised by Roche, or (ii) expires. We identified the determination of the standalone selling prices of the Options as a critical audit matter. Specifically, testing the assumption regarding the likelihood of success for each individual product candidate and the discount rate, which are inputs to the estimate of projected incremental discounted cash flows, involved a high degree of subjectivity. The standalone selling prices of the Options were challenging to audit due to the sensitivity of the calculation of projected incremental discounted cash flows to changes in the likelihood of success assumptions and discount rate. F-3 The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s process to determine the standalone selling prices of the Options, including controls related to the development of the likelihood of success assumption s for each individual product candidate and the discount rate. We performed sensitivity analyses over the likelihood of success assumptions to assess the impact of changes in those assumptions on the Company’s determination of the standalone selling prices of the Options. We evaluated the likelihood of success assumptions by comparing them to industry benchmarks and data, as well as evaluated the relevance and reliability of information published by third-parties used to develop the assumptions. We also evaluated the likelihood of success assumptions by comparing information contained in internal sources to the results of our inquiries of personnel with knowledge of the Company’s research and development activities. We involved a valuation professional with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in evaluating the discount rate used by the Company, by comparing it against a discount rate that was independently developed using publicly available market data for comparable entities /s/ KPMG LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002.

F-8 Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, “Sarepta” or the “Company”) is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on helping patients through the discovery and development of unique RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene therapy and other genetic therapeutic modalities for the treatment of rare diseases. Applying its proprietary, highly-differentiated and innovative technologies, and through collaborations with its strategic partners, the Company is developing potential therapeutic candidates for a broad range of diseases and disorders, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy (“DMD”), Limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (“LGMDs”) and other neuromuscular and central nervous system (“CNS”) disorders. Its first and second commercial products in the U.S., EXONDYS 51 (eteplirsen) Injection (“EXONDYS 51”) and VYONDYS 53 (golodirsen) Injection (“VYONDYS 53”), respectively, were granted accelerated approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) on September 19, 2016 and December 12, 2019, respectively. EXONDYS 51 and VYONDYS 53 are indicated for the treatment of DMD in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 51 and exon 53 skipping, respectively. EXONDYS 51 and VYONDYS 53 use the Company’s phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (“PMO”) chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 51 and exon 53, respectively, of the dystrophin gene. The Company’s third commercial product in the U.S., AMONDYS 45 (casimersen) Injection (“AMONDYS 45”), was granted accelerated approval by the FDA on February 25, 2021. AMONDYS 45 is indicated for the treatment of DMD in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 45 skipping. AMONDYS 45 uses the Company’s PMO chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 45 of the dystrophin gene. Exon skipping is intended to promote the production of an internally truncated but functional dystrophin protein. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately $ 1,947.8 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments, consisting of $ 1,502.6 million of cash and cash equivalents, $ 435.9 million of short-term investments, and $ 9.3 million of restricted cash and investments. The Company believes that its balance of cash, cash equivalents and investments as of December 31, 2020 is sufficient to fund its current operational plan for at least the next twelve months, though it may pursue additional cash resources through public or private debt and equity financings, seek additional government contracts and establish collaborations with or license its technology to other companies. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”), reflect the accounts of Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions between and among its consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated. Management has determined that the Company operates in one segment: discovering, developing, manufacturing and delivering therapies to patients with rare diseases. The Company’s CEO, as the chief operating decision-maker, manages and allocates resources to the operations of the Company on a total company basis. The Company’s research and development organization is responsible for the research and discovery of new product candidates and supports development and registration efforts for potential future products. The Company’s supply chain organization manages the development of the manufacturing processes, clinical trial supply and commercial product supply. The Company’s commercial organization is responsible for commercialization of EXONDYS 51 and VYONDYS 53 in the U.S. and internationally. The Company is supported by other back-office general and administration functions. Consistent with this decision-making process, the Company’s CEO uses consolidated, single-segment financial information for purposes of evaluating performance, forecasting future period financial results, allocating resources and setting incentive targets. In the opinion of the Company’s management, all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair presentation have been reflected. Estimates and Uncertainties The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. F-9 Fair Value Measurements The Company has certain financial assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value which have been classified as Level 1, 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy as described in the accounting standards for fair value measurements: • Level 1—quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; • Level 2—quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and • Level 3—valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant value drivers are unobservable. The fair value of the majority of the Company’s financial assets is categorized as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. These assets include money market funds, and publicly traded debt and equity securities. For additional information related to fair value measurements, please read Note 5, Fair Value Measurements to the consolidated financial statements. Cash Equivalents Only investments that are highly liquid and readily convertible to cash and have original maturities of three months or less are considered cash equivalents. Investments Available-For-Sale Debt Securities Available-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholder’s equity. Interest income and realized gains and losses are reported in other expense, net, on a specific identification basis. Equity Investments The Company’s equity investments include its investments in a publicly traded biotechnology company and privately held biotechnology companies and are included in other non-current assets in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The equity investment in the publicly traded biotechnology company has a readily determinable fair value and is carried at fair value. The equity investments in the privately held biotechnology companies do not have readily determinable fair values and are measured at cost less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Any change in the valuation of equity investments is recorded as a gain or loss on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Accounts Receivable The Company’s accounts receivable primarily arise from product sales. They are generally stated at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Revenues from product sales are recorded at the net sales price (transaction price), which includes estimates of variable consideration for which reserves are established and which result from Medicaid rebates, governmental chargebacks including Public Health Services (“PHS”) chargebacks, prompt pay discounts, co-pay assistance and distribution fees. These reserves are based on the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if no payments are required of the Company) for PHS chargebacks, prompt pay discounts and certain distribution fees, or a current liability (if a payment is required of us), for Medicaid rebates, co-pay assistance and certain distribution fees. The accounts receivable from product sales represents receivables due from the Company’s specialty distributor and specialty pharmacies in the U.S. as well as certain distributors in the EU, Brazil, Israel and the Middle East. The Company has had no historical write-offs of its accounts receivable and its payment terms range from 60 to 91 days for sales within the U.S. and 45 and 150 days for the majority of sales outside the U.S. The Company monitors the financial performance and creditworthiness of its customers so that it can properly assess and respond to changes in the customers’ credit profiles or any specific issues. The Company provides reserves against trade receivables for expected credit losses that may result from a customer’s inability to pay. Amounts determined to be uncollectible are written-off against the established reserve. As of December 31, 2020, the credit profiles for the Company’s customers are deemed to be in good standing and an allowance for credit losses is not considered necessary. F-10 Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of accounts receivable from customers and cash. Three individual customers accounted for 47 %, 39 % and 11 % of net product revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, 43 %, 41 % and 13 % for the year ended December 31, 2019, and 42 %, 38 % and 18 % for the year ended December 31, 2018. Three individual customers accounted for 45 %, 41 % and 9 % of accounts receivable from product sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 45 %, 37 % and 11 % for the year ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020 , the Company believes that such customers are of high credit quality. As of December 31, 2020 , the Company’s cash was concentrated at three financial institutions, which exposes the Company to credit risks. However, the Company does not believe that there is significant risk of non-performance by the financial institutions. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. The Company capitalizes inventory costs associated with products following regulatory approval when future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized. EXONDYS 51 and VYONDYS 53 inventory used in clinical development programs is charged to research and development expense when the product enters the research and development process and no longer can be used for commercial purposes. The Company periodically analyzes its inventories for excess amounts or obsolescence and writes down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value. Additionally, though the Company’s product is subject to strict quality control and monitoring which the Company performs throughout the manufacturing processes, certain batches or units of product may not meet quality specifications resulting in a charge to cost of sales. For products which are under development and have not yet been approved by regulatory authorities, purchased drug product is charged to research and development expense upon delivery. Delivery occurs when the inventory passes quality inspection and ownership transfers to the Company. Nonrefundable advance payments for research and development activities, including production of purchased drug product, are deferred and capitalized until the goods are delivered. If the Company does not expect the goods to be delivered or services to be rendered, the advanced payment capitalized will be charged to expense. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are initially recorded at cost, including the acquisition cost and all costs necessarily incurred to bring the asset to the location and working condition necessary for their intended use. The cost of normal, recurring or periodic repairs and maintenance activities related to property and equipment are expensed as incurred. The cost for planned major maintenance activities, including the related acquisition or construction of assets, is capitalized if the repair will result in future economic benefits. Interest costs incurred during the construction period of major capital projects are capitalized until the asset is ready for its intended use, at which point the interest costs are amortized as depreciation expense over the life of the underlying asset. The Company generally depreciates the cost of its property and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which are summarized as follows: Asset Category Useful lives Lab equipment 5 years Office equipment 5 years Manufacturing equipment 5 years Software and computer equipment 3 - 5 years Furniture and fixtures 7 years Leasehold improvements Lesser of the useful life or the term of the respective lease Land improvements 25 years Land Not depreciated Building and improvements 30 years Construction in progress Not depreciated until put into service F-11 Intangible assets The Company’s intangible assets consist of in-licensed rights, patent costs, and software licenses, which are stated in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets net of accumulated amortization and impairments, if applicable. The in-licensed rights relate to agreements with BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. (“BioMarin”) and the University of Western Australia (“UWA”). The in-licensed rights are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the related patents because the life of the related patents reflects the expected time period that the Company will benefit from the in-licensed rights. Patent costs consist primarily of external legal costs, filing fees incurred to file patent applications and renewal fees on proprietary technology developed or licensed by the Company. Patent costs associated with applying for a patent, being issued a patent and annual renewal fees are capitalized. Costs to defend a patent and costs to invalidate a competitor’s patent or patent application are expensed as incurred. Patent costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated economic lives or the initial term of the patents, which is generally 20 years. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets held and used by the Company, intangible assets with definite lives, equity investments without a readily determinable fair value and right of use (“ROU”) assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. The Company evaluates recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Such reviews assess the fair value of the assets based upon estimates of future cash flows that the assets are expected to generate. Convertible Debt The Company separately accounts for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments that can be settled in cash by allocating the proceeds from issuance between the liability component and the embedded conversion option. The value of the equity component is calculated by first measuring the fair value of the liability component, using the interest rate of a similar liability that does not have a conversion feature, as of the issuance date. The difference between the proceeds from the convertible debt issuance and the amount measured as the liability component is recorded as the equity component with a corresponding discount recorded on the debt. The Company recognizes the amortization of the resulting discount as interest expense using the effective interest method. Simultaneously, the Company bought capped call options from certain counterparties to minimize the impact of potential dilution upon conversion. The premium for the capped call options was recorded as additional paid-in capital. For additional information related to the convertible debt transactions, please read Note 13, Indebtedness to the consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for the goods or services provided. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements within the scope of ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), the Company performs the following five steps: (1) identify the contract with the customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers or provides to the customer. At contract inception, the Company assesses the goods or services promised within each contract and determines those that are performance obligations, and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. The Company then recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when or as the performance obligation is satisfied. The only performance obligation in the Company’s contracts with customers is to timely deliver drug products to the customer’s designated location. Product revenues The Company distributes its products principally through its customers. The customers subsequently resell the product to patients and health care providers. The Company provides no right of return to the customers except in cases of shipping error or product defect. Product revenues are recognized when the customers take control of the product, which typically occurs upon delivery to the customers. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 , the majority of the revenues recognized were generated by the specialty distributor and specialty pharmacies in the U.S. F-12 Variable Consideration Product revenues are recorded at the net sales price (transaction price) which includes estimated reserves for variable consideration, such as Medicaid rebates, governmental chargebacks, including PHS chargebacks, prompt payment discounts, co-pay assistance and distribution fees. These reserves reflect the Company’s best estimates of the amount of consideration to which it is entitled based on the terms of the contracts. Additional details relating to variable consideration follows: • Medicaid rebates relate to the Company’s estimated obligations to states under established reimbursement arrangements. Medicaid rebate reserves are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a liability which is included in accrued expenses. • Governmental chargebacks, including PHS chargebacks, relate to the Company’s estimated obligations resulting from contractual commitments to sell products to qualified healthcare providers at prices lower than the list prices that the Company charges to wholesalers. The wholesaler charges the Company for the difference between what the wholesaler pays for the products and the ultimate selling price to the qualified healthcare providers. Chargeback reserves are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and accounts receivable. Chargeback amounts are generally determined at the time of resale to the qualified healthcare provider from the wholesaler, and the Company generally issues credits for such amounts within a few weeks of receiving notification of resale from the wholesaler. • Prompt payment discounts relate to the Company’s estimated obligations for credits to be granted to specialty pharmacies for remitting payment on their purchases within established incentive periods. Reserves for prompt payment discounts are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and accounts receivable. • Co-pay assistance relates to financial assistance provided to qualified patients, whereby the Company may assist them with prescription drug co-payments required by the patient’s insurance provider. Reserves for co-pay assistance are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a liability which is included in accrued expenses. • Distribution fees relate to fees paid to customers in the distribution channel that provide the Company with inventory management, data and distribution services and are generally accounted for as a reduction of revenue. To the extent that the services received are distinct from the Company’s sale of products to the customers, these payments are accounted for as selling, general and administrative expenses. Reserves for distribution fees result in an increase in a liability if payments are required of the Company or a reduction of accounts receivable if no payments are required of the Company. Collaboration revenue The Company’s collaboration revenue is primarily generated from its collaboration arrangement with F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd. (“Roche”). For more information, please read Note 3, Collaboration and License Agreements . At the inception of a collaboration arrangement, the Company first assesses whether the contractual arrangement is within the scope of ASC Topic 808, Collaborative Arrangements (“ASC 808”) to determine whether the arrangement involves a joint operating activity and involves two (or more) parties that are both active participants in the activity and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of such activity. Then the Company determines whether the collaboration arrangement in its entirety represents a contract with a customer as defined by ASC 606. If only a portion of the collaboration arrangement is potentially with a customer, the Company applies the distinct good or service unit-of-account guidance in ASC 606 to determine whether there is a unit of account that should be accounted for under ASC 606. For the units of account in the collaboration arrangement that do not represent a vendor-customer relationship, the Company will (i) consider applying other GAAP, including by analogy, or (ii) if there is no appropriate analogy, consistently apply a reasonable and rational accounting policy election. In general, by analogy to ASC 606, the Company identifies the performance obligations within the collaboration arrangement and identifies and allocates the transaction price the Company expects to receive on a relative standalone selling price basis to each performance obligation. Variable consideration, consisting of development and regulatory milestones, will be included in the transaction price only if the Company expects to receive such consideration and if it is probable that the inclusion of the variable consideration will not result in a significant reversal in the cumulative amount of revenue recognized under the arrangement. Sales-based royalty and milestone payments are excluded from the transaction price the Company expects to receive until the underlying sales occur because the license to the Company’s intellectual property is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties or milestones relate as it is the primary driver of value in its collaboration arrangement. F-13 For the recognition of revenue associated with each performance obligation, if the Company determines ASC 606 is not appropriate to apply by analogy, the Company will apply a reasonable, rational, and consistently applied accounting policy election to faithfully depict the transfer of services to the collaboration partner over the estimated performance period. Up-front payments from a collaboration partner are recognized as deferred revenue when received and recognized as revenue over the estimated performance period. Reimbursement payments from a collaboration partner associated with research and development cost sharing provisions in a collaboration arrangement are recognized as the related expense is incurred and classified as an offset to research and development expense. Valuation of Product Options The Company's collaboration arrangements may contain options which provide the collaboration partner with the right to obtain additional licenses. If an arrangement contains product options, by analogy to ASC 606, the Company evaluates the product options to determine whether they represent material rights, which may include options to acquire additional goods or services for free or at a discount. If the customer options are determined to represent material rights, they are recognized as a separate performance obligation at inception of the arrangement. The Company allocates a portion of the transaction price of the collaboration arrangement to material rights based on the relative standalone selling price. Amounts allocated to material rights are not recognized as revenue until related options are exercised or expire. Key assumptions to determine the standalone selling price of product options in a collaboration arrangement include, but are not limited to, forecasted revenues, development timelines, incremental costs related to the arrangement, discount rates and likelihood of technical and regulatory success. Research and Development Research and development expenses consist of costs associated with research activities as well as those with the Company’s product development efforts, conducting pre-clinical trials, clinical trials and manufacturing activities. Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred. Up-front fees and milestones paid to third parties in connection with technologies which have not reached technological feasibility and do not have an alternative future use are expensed when incurred. Direct research and development expenses associated with the Company’s programs include clinical trial site costs, clinical manufacturing costs, costs incurred for consultants and other external services, such as data management and statistical analysis support and materials and supplies used in support of clinical programs. Indirect costs of the Company’s clinical programs include salaries, stock-based compensation and an allocation of its facility and technology costs. When third-party service providers’ billing terms do not coincide with the Company’s period-end, the Company is required to make estimates of its obligations to those third parties, including clinical trial and pharmaceutical development costs, contractual services costs and costs for supply of its drug candidates, incurred in a given accounting period and record accruals at the end of the period. The Company bases its estimates on its knowledge of the research and development programs, services performed for the period, past history for related activities and the expected duration of the third-party service contract, where applicable. Stock-Based Compensation The Company’s stock-based compensation programs include stock options, restricted stock awards (“RSAs”), restricted stock units (“RSUs”), stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) and an employee stock purchase program (“ESPP”). The Company accounts for stock-based compensation using the fair value method. The fair values of stock options and SARs are estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The fair values of RSAs and RSUs are based on the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant. The fair value of stock awards, with consideration given to estimated forfeitures, is recognized as stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the grants. For stock awards with performance-vesting conditions, the Company does not recognize compensation expense until it is probable that the performance-vesting condition will be achieved. Under the Company’s ESPP, participating employees purchase common stock through payroll deductions. The purchase price is equal to 85 % of the lower of the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the first business day and the last business day of the relevant purchase period. The fair value of stock purchase rights is estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The fair value of the look-back provision with the 15 % discount is recognized on a graded-vesting basis as stock-based compensation expense over the purchase period. In addition to stock options with service and performance conditions, the Company also granted its CEO options with service and market conditions. A market condition relates to the achievement of a specified price of the Company’s common stock, a specified amount of intrinsic value indexed to the Company’s common stock or a specified price of the Company’s common stock in terms of other similar equity shares. The grant date fair value for the options with service and market conditions is determined by a lattice model with Monte Carlo simulations and is recognized as stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period. F-14 Income Taxes The Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. It is the intention of the Company to reinvest the earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries in those operations and not to repatriate the earnings to the U.S. Accordingly, the Company does not provide for deferred taxes on the excess of the financial reporting over the tax basis in its investments in foreign subsidiaries as they are considered permanent in duration. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered and settled. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the net deferred tax asset to zero when it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon an examination. Leases Effective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASC Topic 842, Leases (“ASC 842”), using the modified retrospective approach and utilizing the effective date as its date of initial application, for which prior periods are presented in accordance with the previous guidance in ASC Topic 840, Leases (“ASC 840”). As a result of adopting ASC 842, the Company recorded lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets of $ 42.5 million and lease liabilities of $ 60.1 million as of January 1, 2019, primarily related to real estate leases, based on the present value of future lease payments on the date of adoption. The difference between the ROU assets and lease liabilities was due to previously recorded net deferred rent liabilities that were reclassified into the ROU assets. There was no impact to retained earnings upon adoption of ASC 842. Amounts related to finance leases were immaterial as of adoption. At the inception of an arrangement, the Company determines whether the arrangement is or contains a lease based on the unique facts and circumstances present in the arrangement. Leases with a term greater than 12 months are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as ROU assets and short-term and long-term lease liabilities, as applicable. The Company has elected not to recognize on the consolidated balance sheets leases with terms of 12 months or less. The Company typically only includes an initial lease term in its assessment of a lease arrangement. Options to renew a lease are not included in the Company’s assessment unless there is reasonable certainty that the Company will renew. The Company monitors its plans to renew its leases no less than on a quarterly basis. In addition, the Company’s lease agreements generally do not contain any residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants. Operating lease liabilities and their corresponding ROU assets are recorded based on the present value of future lease payments over the expected remaining lease term at lease commencement. The initial measurement of the lease liability is determined based on the future lease payments, which may include lease payments that depend on an index or a rate (such as the consumer price index or other market index). The Company initially measures payments based on an index or rate by using the applicable rate at lease commencement and subsequent changes in such rates are recognized as variable lease costs. Variable payments that do not depend on a rate or index are not included in the lease liability and are recognized as they are incurred. Lease cost for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as an operating expense with unrecognized variable lease payments recognized as incurred. Certain adjustments to the ROU asset may be required for items such as lease prepayments or incentives received. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable. As a result, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate, which reflects the fixed rate at which the Company could borrow on a collateralized basis the amount of the lease payments in the same currency, for a similar term, in a similar economic environment. Components of a lease are bifurcated between lease components and non-lease components. The fixed and in-substance fixed contract consideration identified is then allocated based on the relative standalone price to the lease and non-lease components. However, ASC 842 provides entities with a practical expedient that allows an accounting policy election to not separate lease and non-lease components by class of underlying asset. In using this expedient, entities would account for each lease component and the related non-lease component together as a single component. For new and amended real estate leases beginning after January 1, 2019, the Company elected to account for the lease and non-lease components together for existing classes of underlying assets and allocates the contract consideration to the lease component only. In contrast, the Company does not apply the practical expedient for leases embedded in manufacturing and supply agreements with certain of its contract manufacturing organizations and has instead allocated contract consideration between the lease and non-lease components based on their relative standalone price. Embedded Derivatives The Company evaluates certain of its financial and business development transactions to determine if embedded components of these contracts meet the definition of derivative under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging . In general, embedded derivatives are required to be bifurcated from the host instrument if (i) the embedded feature is not clearly and closely related to the host contract and (ii) the embedded feature, if considered a freestanding instrument, meets the definition of a derivative. The embedded derivative is F-15 reported on the consolidated balance sheets at its fair value. Any change in fair value, as determined at each measurement period, is recorded as a component of the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss . Contingent Consideration Certain of the Company’s license and collaboration agreements include future payments that are contingent upon the receipt, or receipt and subsequent sale, of a Priority Review Voucher. The Company has concluded that these contingent payments represent embedded derivatives. The Company records a liability for such contingent payments at fair value on the date the agreements are effective. The Company estimates the fair value of contingent consideration derivatives through a valuation model that includes an income approach based on the probability-weighted expected cash flows that incorporated industry-based probability adjusted assumptions relating to the achievement of the milestone and thus the likelihood of making the payments. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration derivatives can result from changes to one or multiple assumptions, including adjustments to the discount rates, the assumed development timeline and the probability of achievement of certain regulatory milestones. The Company revalues its contingent consideration derivatives upon a material change to one or more of the assumptions discussed above. Changes in the fair value of the Company’s contingent consideration derivatives are recognized in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Such changes are classified as other income (loss) which corresponds to the classification of any gain recognized upon the actual sale of a Priority Review Voucher. Commitments and Contingencies The Company records liabilities for legal and other contingencies when information available to the Company indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Legal costs in connection with legal and other contingencies are expensed as costs are incurred. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not yet adopted In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2019-12, “ Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes”, which is intended to simplify the accounting for income taxes. This ASU removes certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and also clarifies and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. The new standard will be effective beginning January 1, 2021. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact this ASU may have on its financial position and results of operations upon adoption. In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, “ Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity.” This ASU simplifies the complexity associated with applying U.S. GAAP for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity. More specifically, the amendments focus on the guidance for convertible instruments and derivative scope exceptions for contracts in an entity’s own equity. Under ASU 2020-06, the embedded conversion features are no longer separated from the host contract for convertible instruments with conversion features that are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital. Consequently, a convertible debt instrument, such as the Company’s 2024 Convertible Notes, will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost, as long as no other features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives. The new guidance also requires the if-converted method to be applied for all convertible instruments and requires additional disclosures. This guidance is required to be adopted by January 1, 2022, and early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company has elected to early adopt this guidance on January 1, 2021, using the modified retrospective method. Under this transition method, the cumulative effect of accounting change will remove the impact of recognizing the equity component of the Company’s convertible notes (at issuance and the subsequent accounting impact of additional interest expense from debt discount amortization). The cumulative effective of the accounting change will increase the carrying amount of the convertible notes by $ 96.8 million, accumulated deficit will be reduced by $ 60.2 million and additional paid-in capital will be reduced by $ 157.0 million. Future interest expense of the 2024 convertible notes will be lower as a result of adoption of this guidance and diluted net loss per share will be computed using the if-converted method for this security. Recently adopted In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820), Disclosure Framework – Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement”. This ASU removed the following disclosure requirements: (1) the amount of and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy; (2) the policy for timing of transfers between levels; and (3) the valuation processes for Level 3 fair value measurements. Additionally, this update added the following disclosure requirements: (1) the changes in unrealized gains and losses for the period included in other comprehensive income and loss for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements held at the end of the reporting period; (2) the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements. For certain unobservable inputs, an entity may disclose other quantitative information (such as the median or arithmetic average) in lieu of the weighted average if the entity determines that other quantitative information would be a more reasonable and rational method to reflect the distribution of F-16 unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements. ASU No. 2018-13 was effective beginning January 1, 2020. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, “ Intangibles – Goodwill and Other – Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That is a Service Contract”. This ASU requires a customer in a cloud computing arrangement (i.e., hosting arrangement) that is a service contract to follow the internal-use software guidance contained in ASC Subtopic 350-40 to determine which implementation costs to capitalize as assets or expense as incurred. Capitalized implementation costs related to a hosting arrangement that is a service contract will be amortized over the term of the hosting arrangement, beginning when the module or component of the hosting arrangement is ready for its intended use. ASU No. 2018-15 was effective beginning January 1, 2020. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements . In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, “ Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments” . This ASU requires that credit losses for financial instruments measured at amortized cost be reported using an expected losses model rather than the incurred losses model that is currently used, and establishes additional disclosures related to credit risks. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, this standard requires allowances to be recorded instead of reducing the amortized cost of the investment. ASU 2016-13 limits the amount of credit losses to be recognized for available-for-sale debt securities to the amount by which carrying value exceeds fair value and requires the reversal of previously recognized credit losses if fair value increases. ASU 2016-13 was effective beginning January 1, 2020. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In November 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-18, “ Collaborative Arrangements (Topic 808): Clarifying the Interaction between Topic 808 and Topic 606 ”. This ASU: (i) clarifies that certain transactions between collaborative arrangement participants should be accounted for as revenue under ASC 606 when the collaborative arrangement participant is a customer, (ii) provides guidance specifying that a distinct good or service is the unit of account for evaluating whether a transaction is with a customer, and (iii) precludes a company from presenting transactions with a collaborative arrangement participant that are not in the scope of ASC 606 together with revenue from contracts with customers. The new standard was effective beginning January 1, 2020. The Company presents collaboration revenue separate from product revenues. 3. LICENSE AND COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS Roche Holding A.G. On December 21, 2019, the Company entered into a license, collaboration and option agreement with Roche and a stock purchase agreement with an affiliate of Roche (collectively, the “Roche Agreement”), providing Roche with exclusive commercial rights to SRP-9001, the Company’s investigational gene therapy for DMD, outside the U.S. The Company retains all rights to SRP-9001 in the U.S. and will perform all development activities within the joint global development plan necessary to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for SRP-9001 in the U.S. and the EU. Further: (i) research and development expenses incurred under the joint global development plan will be equally shared between the Company and Roche, (ii) Roche is solely responsible for all costs incurred in connection with any development activities (other than those within the joint global development plan) that are necessary to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals outside the U.S, and (iii) the Company will continue to be responsible for the manufacturing of clinical and commercial supplies of SRP-9001. The Company has also granted Roche options to acquire ex-U.S. rights to certain future DMD-specific programs (the “Options”) in exchange for separate option exercise payments, milestone and royalty considerations, and cost sharing provisions. The agreement became effective on February 4, 2020 (“Effective Date”). The Company received an aggregate of approximately $ 1.2 billion in cash consideration from Roche, consisting of an up-front payment and an equity investment in the Company. Additionally, the Company may receive up to $ 1.7 billion in development, regulatory and sales milestones related to SRP-9001. Upon commercialization, the Company is also eligible to receive tiered royalty payments based on net sales. The Roche Agreement is governed by a joint steering committee (“JSC”) formed by representatives from Roche and the Company. The JSC, among other activities, manages the overall strategic alignment between the parties, approves any material update to the joint global development plan and budget and oversees the operations of the subcommittees. The Company determined that the Roche Agreement represents a collaboration arrangement subject to the scope of ASC 808. To determine if the collaboration arrangement was also within the scope of ASC 606, using the unit of account guidance in ASC 606, the Company identified the distinct goods or services in the Roche Agreement and evaluated whether they were transferred to a customer. However, since the Company’s ordinary activities do not include contracting with third parties to provide them with research and development services, it was determined that the Roche Agreement was not within the scope of ASC 606. Thus, for recognition and measurement purposes, the Company must apply other GAAP, including by analogy, or if there is no appropriate analogy, apply a reasonable, rational and consistently applied accounting policy election. F-17 Accordingly, the Company has analogized to ASC 606 for the accounting for certain aspects of the Roche Agreement. Of the $1.2 billion cash received from Roche, $ 316.3 million (or $ 312.1 million net of issuance costs) was allocated to the 2,522,227 shares of the Company’s common stock issued to Roche based on the closing price when the shares were issued. Further, $ 485.0 million was allocated to the Options, as the Company determined that the option exercise payments (ranging from $ 20.0 million to $ 125.0 million per Option) are priced at a discount, resulting in material rights. Lastly, $ 348.7 million was allocated to a single, combined performance obligation (“Combined Performance Obligation”) comprised of: (i) the license of IP relating to SRP-9001 transferred to Roche, (ii) the related research and development services provided under the joint global development plan, (iii) the services provided to manufacture clinical supplies of SRP-9001, and (iv) the Company’s participation in the JSC, because the Company determined that the license of IP and related activities were not capable of being distinct from one another. The Company recorded $ 312.1 million of common shares issued to Roche, based on the closing price of the Company’s stock on the date such shares were issued, net of direct transaction fees incurred of $ 4.3 million. This net amount is reflected as an increase to common stock and additional paid-in-capital in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The $ 485.0 million allocated to the material rights associated with the Options was based on their estimated standalone selling prices, determined using an income approach of projected incremental discounted cash flows from each Option. The discounted cash flows incorporate the likelihood of success of the individual product candidates and the related commercial opportunity. The value assigned to the individual material rights is reflected as deferred revenue and will not be recognized until an option is either: (i) exercised by Roche, or (ii) expires. If exercised, the value of the material right will be aggregated with the option exercise price and recognized over the applicable performance period. If expired, the related transaction price will be recognized immediately. Through December 31, 2020, no options have been exercised or expired. The $348.7 million allocated to the Combined Performance Obligation was based on its estimated standalone selling price. The Company recognizes revenue related to the Combined Performance Obligation on a straight-line basis over the expected performance period of the joint global development plan, which is expected to extend through the fourth quarter of 2023. The Company believes this method represents the best depiction of the transfer of services to Roche, as the estimated full-time equivalent employees dedicated to the services is not expected to materially vary over the expected service period. Revenue relating to future development, regulatory and sales milestones will be recognized when the milestone is probable of achievement (which is typically when the milestone has occurred). Any royalties payable by Roche in the future will be recognized in the period earned. In addition, the Company determined that the supply of commercial product to Roche under the agreement is not priced at a discount and represents optional goods or services (i.e., a contingent promise). Accordingly, any revenues associated with the supply of commercial product in the future will be recognized in the period earned. The Company classifies all revenues recognized under the Roche Agreement as collaboration revenues within the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized $ 84.2 million of collaboration revenue, the majority of which relates to the Combined Performance Obligation. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has total deferred revenue of $ 752.7 million associated with the Roche Agreement, of which $ 89.2 million is classified as current. The portion of deferred revenue related to the separate material rights for the Options was $ 485.0 million as of December 31, 2020. The costs associated with co-development activities performed under the Roche Agreement are included in research and development expenses, with any reimbursement of costs by Roche reflected as a reduction of such expenses when the related expense is incurred. For the year ended December 31, 2020, costs reimbursable by Roche and reflected as a reduction to operating expenses were $ 66.5 million. As of December 31, 2020, there was $ 34.2 million of collaboration receivable included in other current assets. Genethon The Company entered into a sponsored research agreement in May 2017 and subsequently entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Genethon in November 2019 (the “Genethon Collaboration Agreement”) for Genethon’s micro-dystrophin gene therapy program for the treatment of DMD.

Furthermore, upon commercialization, the Company will be required to make tiered royalty payments based on net sales of the Genethon Products and the Other Licensed Products. Under the Genethon Collaboration Agreement, a joint steering committee was established to plan, monitor and coordinate development activities for Genethon Products and Other Licensed Products. The Company and Genethon are responsible for 75 % and 25 %, respectively, of development costs related to both the Genethon Products and the Other Licensed Products. F-18 Upon signing the Genethon Collaboration Agreement, the Company made an up-front payment of $ 28.0 million, which was recorded as research and development expense in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2019. Additionally, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company recorded $ 10.1 million and $ 9.0 million, respectively, of research and development expense related to reimbursable development costs incurred by Genethon for Genethon Products. As of December 31, 2020, no development or regulatory milestones were deemed probable of being achieved and, accordingly, no additional expense has been recognized. StrideBio, Inc. In November 2019, the Company entered into a collaboration and license agreement and a stock purchase agreement (collectively, the “StrideBio Agreements”) with StrideBio, Inc. (“StrideBio”), which granted the Company exclusive worldwide licenses to develop, collaborate and commercialize StrideBio’s adeno-associated viral capsids for gene therapy with respect to multiple initial development targets (“Initial Targets”), and, at the option of the Company, additional development targets (“Additional Targets”). The Company also may be required to participate in StrideBio’s next preferred equity round of financing, subject to certain conditions. Both the Initial Targets and the Additional Targets are comprised of targets to which the Company will have the exclusive right to perform development activities (“Sarepta Development Targets”) and targets that the two parties will jointly develop through completion of Phase 1/2 clinical trials (“Joint Development Targets”). For Sarepta Development Targets and Joint Development Targets, respectively, the Company may be liable for up to $ 450.0 million and $ 835.0 million in development, regulatory and sales milestone payments per target. Furthermore, the Company may be obligated to pay StrideBio up to $ 42.5 million in additional fees when and if Additional Targets are selected. Upon signing the StrideBio Agreements, the Company made an up-front payment of $ 46.9 million, consisting of a cash payment of $ 17.5 million and 301,980 shares of the Company’s common stock delivered to StrideBio with a fair value of $ 29.4 million. The up-front payment was recorded as research and development expense in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, no development or regulatory milestones were deemed probable of being achieved and, accordingly, no additional expense has been recognized. Additionally, upon commercialization, the Company may be required to make tiered royalty payments based on net sales of each target. Myonexus Therapeutics In May 2018, the Company entered into a Warrant to Purchase Common Stock Agreement (“Warrant Agreement”) with Myonexus Therapeutics, Inc. (“Myonexus”), a clinical-stage gene therapy biotechnology company that was developing gene therapies for LGMD. Pursuant to the terms of the Warrant Agreement, the Company made an up-front payment of $ 60.0 million to purchase an exclusive option to acquire Myonexus for $ 200.0 million plus sales-related and regulatory-related contingent payments. The up-front payment, in addition to $ 25.0 million relating to development milestone payments, were recorded to research and development expense during the year ended December 31, 2018. In February 2019, the Company announced that it exercised the exclusive option to acquire Myonexus. The final exercise price as negotiated between the Company and Myonexus was $ 165.0 million. The Company may also be required to make up to $ 200.0 million in additional payments to selling shareholders of Myonexus based on the achievement of certain sales- and regulatory-related milestones. The acquisition closed in April 2019. The acquisition of Myonexus has been accounted for as an asset acquisition as substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a group of similar identifiable assets (the five LGMD gene therapy programs). The total consideration associated with the asset acquisition was $ 178.3 million, consisting of the $165.0 million payment to the selling shareholders of Myonexus, $ 8.8 million in transaction fees associated with the exercise of the exclusive option, and $4.5 million relating to the fair value of contingent consideration (discussed further below). Of this amount, $ 173.2 million was recorded as acquired in-process research and development expense related to the LGMD asset group in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Additionally, the Company determined one regulatory-related milestone (not solely based on drug approval by the FDA) met the definition of a derivative and recorded a contingent consideration liability of $ 4.5 million on the transaction date. The fair value of the contingent consideration liability increased to $ 49.5 million as of December 31, 2020, with the change recorded as other expense in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. P lease refer to Note 5, Fair Value Measurements for further information on the change in fair value of the contingent consideration liability. F-19 Lysogene S.A.

As of December 31, 2020, the Company recorded $ 3.7 million of equity investment in Lysogene as an other non-current asset in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the fair value of this equity investment are recorded to other expense, net in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive loss. The changes in the fair value of the equity investment for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were not material. As of December 31, 2020, no development, regulatory or sales milestones were deemed probable of being achieved and, accordingly, no additional expenses have been recognized. Lacerta Therapeutics In August 2018, the Company entered into a license, development and option agreement (the “Lacerta License Agreement”) and a Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”) with Lacerta Therapeutics, Inc. (“Lacerta”). Pursuant to the Lacerta License Agreement, the Company licensed exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize a pre-clinical Pompe product candidate (the “Pompe License”). Lacerta also granted the Company exclusive options to enter into exclusive license agreements to develop, manufacture and commercialize other gene therapy product candidates for Sanfilipo syndrome and L-Amino Acid Decarboxylase Deficiency for additional consideration of $ 42.0 million (collectively, the “Options”) when (and if) the Options are exercised. Additionally, the Company may be liable for up to approximately $ 44.0 million in development, regulatory and sales milestones associated with the Pompe License and may be required to make tiered royalty payments based on net sales of the Pompe product subsequent to its commercialization. Under the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company purchased approximately 4.5 million shares of Series A preferred stock issued by Lacerta. Under the agreements, the Company made an up-front payment of $ 38.0 million to Lacerta, $ 30.0 million and $ 8.0 million of which were allocated to the Series A preferred stock investment and the Pompe License, respectively. The amount allocated to the Pompe License represents rights to potential future benefits associated with ongoing research and development activities that have no alternative future use. Accordingly, this amount was recorded as research and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2020, no development or regulatory milestones were deemed probable of being achieved and, accordingly, no additional expense has been recognized. The $30.0 million allocated to the Series A preferred stock investment was initially measured at cost and is classified within other non-current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the carrying value of the investment are reported as a component of earnings whenever there are triggering events that warrant impairment or observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of Lacerta in the future. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company did no t record any changes in carrying value of the investment as Lacerta did not issue identical or similar shares during the corresponding periods. Nationwide Children’s Hospital In December 2016, the Company entered into an exclusive option agreement with Nationwide Children’s Hospital (“Nationwide”) from which the Company obtained an exclusive right to acquire a worldwide license of the micro-dystrophin gene therapy technology for DMD and Becker muscular dystrophy.

Both intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the relevant patents and have a combined carrying value of $ 0.9 million as of December 31, 2020 . For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded $ 5.7 million and $ 3.5 million in royalty expense, respectively, which is included in cost of sales, related to agreements with UWA with no such expense incurred in 2018. As of December 31, 2020 , no other development, regulatory or sales milestones were deemed probable of being achieved and, accordingly, no additional in-licensed rights or expenses have been recognized. Research and Option Agreements During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company entered into multiple research and option agreements with third parties in order to develop various technologies and biologics that may be used in the administration of the Company’s genetic therapeutics, with aggregate up-front payments made by the Company of $ 17.7 million, which was recorded as research and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The agreements generally provide for research services related to preclinical development programs, and options to license the technology for clinical development. Prior to the options under these agreements being executed, the Company may be required to make up to $ 14.0 million in research milestone payments. Under these agreements, there are $ 237.0 million in potential option payments to be made by the Company upon the determination to exercise the options. Additionally, if the options for each agreement are executed, the Company would incur additional contingent obligations and may be required to make development, regulatory, and sales milestone payments and tiered royalty payments based on the sales of the developed products upon commercialization. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has not exercised any options nor have any research milestone payments become probable of occurring and, accordingly, no additional expenses have been recognized. F-21 Milestone Obligations Including the agreements discussed above, the Company has license and collaboration agreements in place for which it could be obligated to pay, in addition to the payment of up-front fees upon execution of the agreements, certain milestone payments as a product candidate proceeds from the submission of an investigational new drug application through approval for commercial sale and beyond.

Following the early termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart -Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, in March 2020, the Company completed its sale of the PRV and received proceeds of $ 108.1 million, net of commission, which was recorded as a gain from sale of the PRV as it did not have a carrying value at the time of the sale. 5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The tables below present information about the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that are measured and carried at fair value and indicate the level within the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques it utilizes to determine such fair value: Fair Value Measurement as of December 31, 2020 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 (in thousands) Assets Money market funds $ 629,440 $ 629,440 $ — $ — Government and government agency bonds 1,037,981 1,037,981 — — Strategic equity investments 38,799 3,699 — 35,100 Certificates of deposit 250 250 — — Total assets $ 1,706,470 $ 1,671,370 $ — $ 35,100 Liabilities Contingent consideration $ 50,800 $ — $ — $ 50,800 Total liabilities $ 50,800 $ — $ — $ 50,800 Fair Value Measurement as of December 31, 2019 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 (in thousands) Assets Money market funds $ 203,410 $ 203,410 $ — $ — Government and government agency bonds 809,159 809,159 — — Strategic equity investments 31,937 1,937 — 30,000 Certificates of deposit 1,001 1,001 — — Total assets $ 1,045,507 $ 1,015,507 $ — $ 30,000 Liabilities Contingent consideration $ 5,200 $ — $ — $ 5,200 Total liabilities $ 5,200 $ — $ — $ 5,200 F-22 The Company’s assets with fair value categorized as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy include money market funds, government and government agency bonds, certificates of deposit, and the Company’s strategic investment in Lysogene, a publicly traded company in France, as more fully described in Note 3, License and Collaboration Agreements . Certain of the government and government agency bonds and corporate bonds are publicly traded fixed income securities and are presented as cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s assets with fair value categorized as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy consists of a strategic investment in Series A preferred stock of Lacerta as more fully described in Note 3, License and Collaboration Agreements and a strategic investment in Series A preferred stock of another private company. The fair value of the Lacerta investment was initially based on a cost approach corroborated by the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The most significant assumptions in the option pricing model include historical volatility of similar public companies, estimated term through Lacerta’s potential exit and a risk-free rate based on certain U.S. Treasury rates. The investment in the private company is recorded at fair value at the time of purchase as measured by the investment cost. At the end of each reporting period, the fair value of investments in equity securities will be adjusted if the issuer were to issue similar or identical equity securities or when there is a triggering event for impairment. There were no changes in the fair value of the strategic investments during the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company’s contingent consideration liability with fair value categorized as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy relate to the regulatory-related contingent payments to Myonexus selling shareholders as well as to certain academic institutions under separate license agreements that meet the definition of a derivative. For more information related to Myonexus, please read Note 3, License and Collaboration Agreements . The contingent consideration liability was estimated using an income approach based on the probability-weighted expected cash flows that incorporated industry-based probability adjusted assumptions relating to the achievement of the milestone and thus the likelihood of making the payments. This fair value measurement was based upon significant inputs not observable in the market and therefore represented a Level 3 measurement. Significant changes which increase or decrease the probabilities of achieving the milestone or shorten or lengthen the time required to achieve the milestone would result in a corresponding increase or decrease in the fair value of the liability. At the end of each reporting period, the fair value is adjusted to reflect the most current assumptions through earnings. There were no changes transfers between Levels 1, 2 and 3 during the year ended December 31, 2020. The following table represents a roll-forward of the fair value of Level 3 financial liabilities: For the Year Ended December 31, 2020 (in thousands) Fair value at the beginning of the period $ 5,200 Additions of contingent consideration 600 Changes in estimated fair value 45,000 Fair value at the end of the period $ 50,800 An increase of $ 0.6 million was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020, to account for new contingent consideration liabilities associated with new license agreements with certain academic institutions that meet the definition of a derivative. An increase of $ 45.0 million was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020, to account for the change in fair value of existing contingent consideration liabilities. This change, which is recorded as a loss on contingent consideration in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, was a result of updates made to certain inputs and assumptions impacting the probability-weighted expected cash flows, principally the probability of success of the underlying programs, the estimate of the amount of payments to be ultimately made, and the estimate of the year that the payments are expected to be made. The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments. For fair value information related to the Company’s debt facilities, please read Note 13, Indebtedness . 6.

INDEBTEDNESS 2024 Convertible Notes On November 14, 2017, the Company issued $ 570.0 million senior notes due on November 15, 2024 (the “2024 Notes”). The 2024 Notes were issued at face value and bear interest at the rate of 1.50 % per annum, payable semi-annually in cash on each May 15 and November 15, commencing on May 15, 2018. The 2024 Notes contain customary covenants and events of default, occurrence of which permits the certain holders to accelerate all outstanding obligations, including principal and interest. Upon conversion, the Company may pay cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and stock, as determined by the Company in its discretion. The 2024 Notes may be convertible into 7,763,552 shares of the Company’s common stock under certain circumstances prior to maturity at a conversion rate of 13.621 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the 2024 Notes, which represents a conversion price of $ 73.42 per share, subject to adjustment under certain conditions. The Company allocated the proceeds received from issuance of the 2024 Notes between the liability component and the embedded conversion option, or equity component. The liability component was determined by measuring the fair value of similar notes that do not include the embedded conversion option. The Company allocated $ 161.1 million to the equity component, which was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the 2024 Notes. The equity component, net of allocated offering costs of $ 4.2 million, was recorded as an increase additional paid-in capital. The equity component, plus $ 10.6 million of offering costs allocated to the liability component, represent the total debt discount on the 2024 Notes at issuance. The debt discount is amortized under the effective interest method and recorded as additional interest expense over the life of the 2024 Notes. The effective interest rate on the liability component of the 2024 Notes for the year ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was 6.9 %. F-27 Upon the occurrence of a “fundamental change”, which includes (1) change in beneficial ownership of the Company where any person/group possesses more than 50 % of the voting power of the Company, (2) consolidation or merger of the Company, (3) shareholder approval of a liquidation plan or (4) the Company is delisted from NYSE or NASDAQ, the holders may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the 2024 Notes for cash at 100 % of the principal amount of the 2024 Notes being purchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. Additionally, upon the occurrence of a “make-whole fundamental change” prior to the maturity date, the Company shall adjust the conversion rate on a sliding scale basis detailed in the agreement To minimize the impact of potential dilution upon conversion of the 2024 Notes, the Company separately entered into capped call transactions with certain counterparties. The capped calls have a strike price of $ 73.42 and a cap price of $ 104.88 and are exercisable when and if the 2024 Notes are converted. If, upon conversion of the 2024 Notes, the price of the Company’s common stock is between the strike price and the cap price of the capped calls, the counterparties will deliver shares of the Company’s common stock and/or cash with an aggregate value equal to the difference between the price of the Company’s common stock at the conversion date and the strike price, multiplied by the number of shares of the Company’s common stock related to the capped calls being exercised. The Company paid $ 50.9 million for these capped calls transactions, which was recorded as additional paid-in capital. December 2019 Term Loan On December 13, 2019, the Company entered into a loan agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) which provides a term loan (“December 2019 Term Loan”) of $ 500.0 million with Biopharma Credit PLC and Biopharma Credit Investments V (Master) LP (collectively, the “Lenders”). The December 2019 Term Loan has two tranches: A and B, each of which had an initial loan amount of $ 250.0 million, prior to the Amendment. On December 20, 2019, the Company drew down tranche A of the December 2019 Term Loan and had the option to draw down tranche B of the loan no later than December 31, 2020, subject to certain conditions. On September 24, 2020, the Company entered into a first amendment to Credit Agreement (the “Amendment”). The Amendment increased the aggregate principal amount of tranche B of the December 2019 Term Loan from $250.0 million to $ 300.0 million and revised certain fees. On November 2, 2020, the Company drew down tranche B of the December 2019 Term Loan. Tranche A and B of the December 2019 Term Loan matures on December 20, 2023 and December 31, 2024 , respectively, when the principal amount of the loan will become due. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to 8.5 %, which shall be payable quarterly in arrears. The Company is also required to pay the Lenders (1) a fee of 1.75 % of the amounts drawn under tranche A of the December 2019 Term Loan due on the date tranche A is drawn, which was paid in December 2019, (2) a fee of 2.95 % of the amounts drawn under tranche B of the December 2019 Term Loan due on the date tranche B is drawn, which was paid in November 2020, (3) a fee of 2.00 % of principal amount on the December 2019 Term Loan maturity dates or prepayment amount on each prepayment date and (4) certain out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Lenders. The Company may voluntarily prepay, in whole or in part, the outstanding balance under the December 2019 Term Loan at any time after the tranche A closing date. Upon occurrence of a change in control, the Company is required to repay any amounts outstanding under the December 2019 Term Loan. In the event of a permitted prepayment, the Company would be obligated to make the following premium payments: (1) an amount equal to the sum of all interest that would have been accrued and payable from the prepayment date through December 20, 2021 (“Makewhole Amount”), and (2) an amount equal to 1.0 % to 2.0 % of the prepayment amount depending on the date of the prepayment (“Prepayment Premium”). The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants as well as events of default, the occurrence of which would permit the Lenders to accelerate the payment of all outstanding obligations, including the payment of the Makewhole Amount and Prepayment Premium. Upon draw-down of tranche A, the Company received net proceeds of $ 244.9 million for tranche A, net of a debt discount of $ 9.4 million relating to fees payable to the Lenders, $ 5.0 million of which is expected to be paid on December 20, 2023, and debt issuance costs of $ 0.7 million, both of which are being treated as a reduction to the carrying value of tranche A of the December 2019 Term Loan and amortized as interest expense over the term of the loan based on an effective interest method. Upon draw-down of tranche B, the company received net proceeds of $ 291.1 million, net of a debt discount of $ 14.9 million relating to fees payable to the Lenders, $ 6.0 million of which is expected to be paid on December 31, 2024, and debt issuance costs of F-28 less than $ 0.1 million, both of which are being treated as a reduction to the carrying value of tranche B of the December 2019 Term Loan and amortized as interest expense over the term of the loan based on an effective interest method.

The fair values of stock options granted during the periods presented are measured on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, with the following assumptions: For the Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Risk-free interest rate (1) 0.1 - 1.3% 1.4 - 2.5% 2.5 - 3.0% Expected dividend yield (2) — — — Expected term (3) 5.00 years 5.04 years 5.06 years Expected volatility (4) 57.3 - 68.2% 52.5 - 68.9% 52.4 - 60.8% (1) The risk-free interest rate is estimated using an average of Treasury bill interest rates over a historical period commensurate with the expected term of the option that correlates to the prevailing interest rates at the time of grant. (2) The expected dividend yield is zero as the Company has not paid any dividends to date and does not expect to pay dividends in the future. (3) The expected term is estimated using historical exercise behavior. ( 4 ) The expected volatility is the implied volatility in exchange-traded options of the Company’s common stock. The amounts estimated according to the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model may not be indicative of the actual values realized upon the exercise of these options by the holders.

The expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2 years. Of this amount, $ 107.4 million relates to options with service conditions only, $ 13.2 million relates to awards with service and market conditions, and the remaining $ 69.2 million related to restricted stock awards or restricted stock units with service conditions only. 16. 401 (K) PLAN The Company sponsors a 401(k) Plan (“the Plan”) in the U.S. and other retirement plans in the rest of the world, all of which are defined contribution plans. The Plan is available to all employees who are age 21 or older. Participants may make voluntary contributions and the Company makes matching contributions according to the Plan’s matching formula. Matching contributions fully vest after one year of service for all employees. The expense related to the Plan primarily consists of the Company’s matching contributions. Expense related to the Plan totaled $ 5.3 million, $ 3.4 million and $ 2.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. F-33 17.

INCOME TAXES The following table summarizes the loss before the provision for income taxes by jurisdiction for the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 (in thousands) Domestic $ ( 204,956 ) $ ( 489,747 ) $ ( 309,294 ) Foreign ( 348,109 ) ( 224,133 ) ( 53,316 ) Total $ ( 553,065 ) $ ( 713,880 ) $ ( 362,610 ) The following table summarizes provision for income taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 (in thousands) Current provision: Federal $ 4 $ — $ ( 110 ) State 624 521 ( 653 ) Foreign 680 1,050 311 Total current provision 1,308 1,571 ( 452 ) Deferred benefit: Federal — ( 15 ) — State — ( 5 ) — Foreign ( 245 ) ( 356 ) ( 240 ) Total deferred benefit ( 245 ) ( 376 ) ( 240 ) Total current provision $ 1,063 $ 1,195 $ ( 692 ) F-34 The following table summarizes the reconciliation between the Company’s effective tax rate and the income tax rate for each of the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Federal income tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 % State taxes 4.0 6.3 12.3 Research and development and other tax credits 6.6 3.3 3.1 Valuation allowance ( 21.3 ) ( 16.8 ) ( 45.5 ) Permanent differences 2.2 1.8 6.9 Sarepta International C.V. return to provision — — ( 0.1 ) Basis difference in subsidiary — ( 8.4 ) — Foreign rate differential ( 12.9 ) ( 7.4 ) ( 0.9 ) Other 0.2 — 3.4 Effective tax rate ( 0.2 ) % ( 0.2 ) % 0.2 % Permanent differences affecting the Company’s effective tax rate primarily include excess stock-based compensation tax deductions, net of non-deductible stock-based compensation and limitation on officer compensation deduction. In February 2019, the Company exercised its option to acquire Myonexus. Accumulated costs of $ 253.7 million, associated with the Myonexus acquisition, were expensed for U.S. GAAP purposes. Of the $253.7 million in accumulated costs, $ 85.0 million relates to up-front and milestone payments as a result of the execution of the Warrant Agreement in May 2018 as well as certain development milestones being achieved or becoming probable of being achieved and $ 168.7 million relates to the exercise of the exclusive option to acquire Myonexus in February 2019. For U.S. income tax purposes, these costs are considered to be an investment in the subsidiary and are not currently deductible for tax purposes. The permanent difference related to this acquisition is separately stated in the rate reconciliation above. In December 2012, the Company licensed certain intellectual property of Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. to its wholly owned Netherlands subsidiary, Sarepta International C.V. The parties also entered into a contract research agreement under which Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. performs research services for Sarepta International C.V. In January 2016, Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. entered into a manufacturing and distribution agreement as well as service agreement with Sarepta International C.V. In conjunction with its recent filings, it was determined that beginning in 2016, Sarepta International C.V. is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business by the entity in the U.S. and, accordingly, the 2016, 2017 and 2018 losses are subject to U.S. income taxes. In May 2018, Sarepta International C.V. merged into another wholly owned U.S. subsidiary of Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. F-35 The following table summarizes the analysis of the deferred tax assets and liabilities for each of the periods indicated: As of December 31, 2020 2019 (in thousands) Deferred tax assets: Net operating loss carryforwards $ 333,703 $ 304,033 Difference in depreciation and amortization 31,259 40,095 Research and development tax credits 159,917 103,806 Stock-based compensation 31,212 24,114 Lease liabilities 13,120 15,796 Deferred revenue — 939 Capitalized inventory 35,959 18,255 Other 28,381 16,270 Total deferred tax assets 633,551 523,308 Deferred tax liabilities: Right of use asset ( 8,772 ) ( 10,782 ) Debt discount ( 18,044 ) ( 23,099 ) Total deferred tax liabilities ( 26,816 ) ( 33,881 ) Valuation allowance ( 605,848 ) ( 488,829 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 887 $ 598 The Company has evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of its U.S. net deferred tax assets, which are comprised principally of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, research and development tax credit carryforwards, stock-based compensation expense, capitalized inventory, and intangibles. Under the applicable accounting standards, management has considered the Company’s history of losses and concluded that it is more likely than not that the Company will not recognize the benefits of net federal and state deferred tax assets. Accordingly, a full valuation allowance of the U.S. net deferred tax asset had been established at December 31, 2020 and 2019. The net change in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was an increase of $ 117.0 million and $ 119.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. This increase for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to the generation of federal and state net operating losses, income tax credits and an increase in capitalized inventory costs. The Company generated foreign deferred tax assets mainly consisting of net operating loss carryforwards, stock-based compensation and unrealized gain/losses. Based upon the income projections in the majority of the foreign jurisdictions, the Company believes it will realize the benefit of its future deductible differences in these jurisdictions. As such, the Company has not recorded a valuation allowance against these foreign jurisdictions. Brazil, the Netherlands, Czech Republic and one of the entities in the United Kingdom have generated deferred tax assets, which consist of net operating loss carryforwards and stock-based compensation expense. The Company has concluded that it is more likely than not that we will not recognize the future benefits of the deferred tax assets, and accordingly, a full valuation allowance has been recorded against these foreign deferred tax assets. In 2019, the Company undertook an internal restructuring involving its subsidiary in Switzerland. The restructuring resulted in the utilization of all of its net operating loss carryforwards and the release of its previously established valuation allowance of $ 7.9 million. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $ 1,298.3 million and $ 872.3 million, respectively, available to reduce future taxable income. The federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of $ 581.3 million and $ 819.9 million will expire at various dates between 2021 and 2040 . The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $ 717.0 million and $ 52.4 million, respectively, can be carried forward indefinitely. Utilization of these net operating losses could be limited under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and similar state laws based on historical or future ownership changes and the value of the Company’s stock. Additionally, the Company has $ 111.9 million and $ 57.7 million of federal and state research and development credits, respectively, available to offset future taxable income. These federal and state research and development credits begin to expire between 2021 and 2040 and between 2021 and 2035 , respectively. The Company also has foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 11.4 million, mainly derived from the net operating loss generated by its subsidiary in Brazil, which may be carried forward indefinitely. The Company, or one of its subsidiaries, files income tax returns in the U.S., and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The federal, state and foreign income tax returns are generally subject to tax examinations for the tax years ended December 31, 2017 through December 31, 2019. To the extent the Company has tax attribute carryforwards, the tax years in which the attribute was generated may still be adjusted upon examination by the Internal Revenue Service, state or foreign tax authorities to the extent utilized in a future period. F-36 The follow table summarizes the reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of total unrecognized tax benefits for each of the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 (in thousands) Balance at beginning of the period $ 41,753 $ 37,544 $ 5,134 Increase related to current year tax positions 6,722 4,275 2,164 Increase related to prior year tax positions — 109 30,246 Decrease related to prior year tax positions — ( 175 ) — Balance at end of the period $ 48,475 $ 41,753 $ 37,544 The balance of total unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2020, if recognized, would not affect the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations, due to a full valuation allowance against the Company’s U.S. deferred tax assets. The Company does not expect that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly in the next twelve months. The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. It had no accrual for interest or penalties on its consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2020 or 2019. No interest and/or penalties were recognized in 2019 or 2018. The Company’s intent is to only make distributions from non-U.S. subsidiaries in the future when they can be made at no net tax cost. Otherwise, the Company considers all of its foreign earnings to be permanently reinvested outside of the U.S. and has no plans to repatriate these foreign earnings to the U.S. The Company has no material unremitted earnings from its non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act created a new provision that certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries, known as global intangible low-tax income, must be included in the gross income of their U.S. shareholder. The Company has adopted a policy to account for this provision as a period cost. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the ""CARES Act"") was enacted in the United States on March 27, 2020. While the CARES Act provides extensive tax changes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the provisions are not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s financial results. 19. LEASES The Company has real estate operating leases in Cambridge, Andover and Burlington, Massachusetts and Dublin and Columbus, Ohio that provide for scheduled annual rent increases throughout each lease’s term. The Company has also identified leases embedded in certain of its manufacturing and supply agreements as the Company determined that it controls the use of the facilities and related equipment therein. For more information related to manufacturing and supply agreements with Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. (“Thermo”) and Catalent, Inc. (“Catalent”), please refer to Note 21, Commitments . The lease on all four dedicated clean room suites at Catalent and four of the eight dedicated clean room suites at Thermo commenced during 2020, which is when the dedicated clean room suites became available for use by the Company. Accordingly, the fixed and in-substance fixed contract consideration associated with the dedicated clean room suites was allocated to the lease and non-lease components. The lease component was determined based on the estimated standalone price of the leased clean rooms and the associated equipment based on available market and specific cost information. The non-lease component was determined using the residual estimation approach as the standalone price of the gene therapy manufacturing and supply services provided by both Catalent and Thermo is highly variable. Lease expense recognized prior to regulatory approval of the related product will be classified to research and development expense. Upon regulatory approval, lease expense will be classified to cost of inventory with the recognition in cost of sales as the sales of product occur. The leases on the remaining four clean room suites at Thermo have not commenced as of December 31, 2020 because these clean room suites are not yet available for use by the Company. Accordingly, cumulative payments totaling $ 52.7 million made to Thermo as of December 31, 2020 have been recorded as other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, a portion of which will be considered in the initial measurement of the cost of the ROU asset at the lease commencement date, currently anticipated to occur in the first half of 2021. F-37 As of December 31, 2020, ROU assets for operating leases were $ 91.8 million and operating lease liabilities were $ 101.3 million. The following table contains a summary of the lease costs recognized under ASC 842 and other information pertaining to the Company’s operating leases for the year ended December 31, 2020: For the Year Ended December 31, 2020 (in thousands) Lease cost Operating lease cost $ 18,978 Variable lease cost 17,065 Total lease cost $ 36,043 Other information Operating lease payments $ 19,344 Operating lease liabilities arising from obtaining ROU assets 59,327 Weighted average remaining lease term 4.6 years Weighted average discount rate 7.6 % The following table summarizes maturities of lease liabilities and the reconciliation of lease liabilities as of December 31, 2020: As of December 31, 2020 (in thousands) 2021 $ 27,846 2022 25,513 2023 25,615 2024 25,430 2025 10,910 Thereafter 4,131 Total minimum lease payments 119,445 Less: imputed interest ( 18,148 ) Total operating lease liabilities $ 101,297 Included in the consolidated balance sheet: Current portion of lease liabilities within other current liabilities $ 20,930 Lease liabilities 80,367 Total operating lease liabilities $ 101,297 F-38 20. NET LOSS PER SHARE Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding. Given that the Company recorded a net loss for each of the periods presented, there is no difference between basic and diluted net loss per share since the effect of common stock equivalents would be anti-dilutive and are, therefore, excluded from the diluted net loss per share calculation. For the Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 (in thousands, except per share amounts) Net loss $ ( 554,128 ) $ ( 715,075 ) $ ( 361,918 ) Weighted-average common shares outstanding - basic 77,956 73,615 66,250 Effect of dilutive securities* — — — Weighted-average common shares outstanding - diluted 77,956 73,615 66,250 Net loss per share — basic and diluted $ ( 7.11 ) $ ( 9.71 ) $ ( 5.46 ) * For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, stock options, RSAs, RSUs, SARs and ESPP to purchase approximately 9.0 million, 9.1 million and 9.1 million shares of common stock, respectively, were excluded from the net loss per share calculation as their effect would have been anti-dilutive. The Company accounts for the effect of the 2024 Notes on diluted net earnings per share using the if-converted method as they may be settled in cash or shares at the Company’s option. While the closing price on December 31, 2020, exceeded the conversion price of $ 73.42 , the potential shares issuable under the 2024 Notes were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share as they were anti-dilutive using the if-converted method. In the period of conversion, the 2024 Notes will have no impact on diluted net loss if they are settled in cash and will have an impact on diluted earnings per share if the 2024 Notes are settled in shares upon conversion and when the Company is in an income position. 21. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Manufacturing Obligations The Company has entered into long-term contractual arrangements from time to time for the provision of goods and services. Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. The Company entered into a development, commercial manufacturing and supply agreement in June 2018 and, subsequently, entered into the first and second amendments in May 2019 and July 2020, respectively, with Thermo, formerly Brammer Bio MA, LLC (collectively, the “Thermo Supply Agreements”). Pursuant to the terms of the Thermo Supply Agreements, the Company has access to substantially all of the related facility’s capacity for the Company’s gene therapy programs, subject to certain minimum and maximum volume limitations. The term of the Thermo Supply Agreements will continue for a period of six years following the first regulatory approval of a product manufactured under the agreements. The term will automatically renew for successive two years unless the Company notifies Thermo of its intention not to renew (no less than twenty-four months prior to the expiration of the term). The Company also has the ability to terminate the agreement prior to expiration, subject to the payment of additional financial consideration. The Company determined that the Thermo Supply Agreements contain a lease because the Company has the right to direct the use of the facility and related equipment therein . Refer to Note 19, Leases , for further information. Catalent, Inc. The Company entered into a manufacturing collaboration agreement and, subsequently, entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement with Catalent, formerly Paragon Biosciences, Inc. in October 2018 and February 2019, respectively (collectively, the “Catalent Agreements”). Pursuant to the terms of the Catalent Agreements, Catalent agreed to provide the Company with two dedicated clean room suites and an option to reserve two additional clean room suites for its gene therapy programs, subject to certain minimum and maximum volume limitations. In September 2019, the Company exercised the option to gain access to the two additional clean room suites. The Catalent Agreements will expire on December 31, 2024 . The Company has the ability to terminate the Catalent Agreements prior to expiration, subject to the payment of additional financial consideration. The Company determined that the Catalent Agreements contain a lease because the Company has the right to direct the use of the facility and related equipment therein. Refer to Note 19, Leases , for further information. F-39 Aldevron, LLC The Company entered into a clinical and commercial supply agreement in December 2018, as subsequently amended in June 2020, with Aldevron LLC (“Aldevron”) for the supply of plasmid DNA to fulfill its needs for gene therapy clinical trials and commercial supply (collectively, the “Aldevron Agreements”). Pursuant to the terms of the Aldevron Agreements, Aldevron agreed to reserve a certain amount of manufacturing capacity on a quarterly basis. In return, the Company is required to make advance payments to Aldevron related to the manufacturing capacity. The term of the Aldevron Agreements will expire on December 31, 2026 . The Company has the option to extend the term of the Aldevron Agreements by one year if the Company delivers a written notice of its intention to extend to Aldevron no later than June 1, 2025. Both parties have the right to early terminate without additional penalty. The Company has determined that the Aldevron Agreements do not contain an embedded lease because it does not convey the right to control the use of Aldevron’s facility or related equipment therein. As of December 31, 2020 , the Company recorded $ 16.3 million in other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets related to the prepayments made to Aldevron. The prepayments will be credited back to the Company, until exhausted, for each batch of product delivered by Aldevron, in an amount equal to 50 % of the batch invoice amount. The gross cost of batches purchased from Aldevron since inception of the agreement have been classified as research and development expense. In the event the Company does not expect services under the Aldevron Agreements to be rendered to fully exhaust any prepayments made to Aldevron, the applicable balance will be charged to expense at the time this determination is made. The following table presents non-cancelable contractual obligations arising from long-term contractual arrangements, including obligations related to leases embedded in certain supply agreements : As of December 31, 2020 (in thousands) 2021 $ 632,257 2022 208,485 2023 107,612 2024 105,932 2025 101,932 Thereafter 138,217 Total manufacturing commitments $ 1,294,435 Additionally, should the Company obtain regulatory approval for any drug product candidate produced as a part of the Company’s manufacturing obligations above, additional minimum batch requirements with the respective manufacturing parties would be required. Other Funding Commitments The Company has several on-going clinical trials in various clinical trial stages. Its most significant clinical trial expenditures are to contract research organizations (“CROs”). The CRO contracts are generally cancellable at the Company’s option. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has approximately $ 280.9 million in cancellable future commitments based on existing CRO contracts. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company recognized approximately $ 40.4 million, $ 31.6 million and $ 19.6 million, respectively, for expenditures incurred by CROs. Litigation In the normal course of business, the Company may from time to time be named as a party to various legal claims, actions and complaints, including matters involving securities, employment, intellectual property, effects from the use of therapeutics utilizing its technology, or others. For example, on September 15, 2020, REGENXBIO INC. (“RegenX”) and the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania filed a lawsuit against the Company and Sarepta Therapeutics Three, LLC (together, “Sarepta”), in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. The plaintiffs assert patent infringement of U.S. Patent No. 10,526,617 (“the ‘617 Patent”) under 35 U.S.C.§§ 271(a)-(c) based on Sarepta’s alleged direct or indirect manufacture and use of cultured host cell technology to make adeno-associated virus (“AAV”) gene therapy products, including SRP-9001. Specifically, the Complaint essentially includes the allegation that Sarepta’s use, and the use by its contract manufacturers on its behalf, of a host cell containing a recombinant acid molecule that encodes a capsid protein having at least 95% amino acid identity to AAVrh10 infringes upon the ‘617 Patent asserted by RegenX. Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief, a judgment of infringement, an unspecified amount of damages that is no less than a reasonable royalty, a judgment of willful infringement, attorneys’ fees and costs, and such other relief as the court deems just and proper. On November 4, 2020, Sarepta moved to dismiss the case pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) based on the Safe Harbor provision of non-infringement contained in 35 U.S.C. § 271(e)(1). On December 16, 2020, Sarepta and RegenX both filed requests for oral argument. The Court has not scheduled a date for the hearing. We are unable to provide an estimate of possible loss or range of possible loss. F-40 22. SUBSEQUENT EVENT Our third commercial product, AMONDYS 45 (casimersen) Injection (“AMONDYS 45”), was granted accelerated approval by the FDA on February 25, 2021. AMONDYS 45 is indicated for the treatment of DMD in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 45 skipping. AMONDYS 45 uses our PMO chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 45 of the dystrophin gene. On February 25, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement to sell the rare pediatric disease PRV it received from the FDA in connection with the approval of AMONDYS 53 for consideration of $ 102.0 million. The closing of the transaction is subject to the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and other customary conditions. When the transaction closes, the net proceeds will be recorded as a gain from sale of the PRV as it does not have a carrying value at the time of the sale.

Business. Overview We are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on helping patients through the discovery and development of unique RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene therapy and other genetic therapeutic modalities for the treatment of rare diseases. Applying our proprietary, highly-differentiated and innovative technologies, and through collaborations with our strategic partners, we are developing potential therapeutic candidates for a broad range of diseases and disorders, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy (“DMD”), Limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (“LGMDs”), Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA (“MPS IIIA”) and other neuromuscular and central nervous system (“CNS”) related disorders. Our first commercial product, EXONDYS 51 (eteplirsen) Injection (“EXONDYS 51”), was granted accelerated approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) on September 19, 2016. EXONDYS 51 is indicated for the treatment of DMD in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 51 skipping. EXONDYS 51 uses our phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (“PMO”) chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 51 of the dystrophin gene. Our second commercial product, VYONDYS 53 (golodirsen) Injection (“VYONDYS 53”), was granted accelerated approval by the FDA on December 12, 2019. VYONDYS 53 is indicated for the treatment of DMD in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 53 skipping. VYONDYS 53 uses our PMO chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 53 of the dystrophin gene. In addition to our commercial-stage products, we have a PMO-based product candidate in clinical development that is designed to treat those patients with DMD who have genetic mutations amenable to skipping exon 45 of the DMD gene (SRP-4045) (casimersen). In January 2020, we commenced our rolling submission of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) to the FDA seeking accelerated approval for casimersen. We also have other PMO-based product candidates in discovery and preclinical development that are designed to skip other exons of the DMD gene. Exon skipping is intended to promote the production of an internally truncated but functional dystrophin protein. The original PMO structure and variations of this structure that are so-called PMO-based (collectively “PMO-based”) are central to our proprietary chemistry platform. PMO technologies can be used to selectively up-regulate or down-regulate the production of a target protein through pre-mRNA splice alteration. PMO-based compounds have the potential to be designed to create more, less, or none of certain proteins, or produce analogues of endogenous proteins. This technology can be used to correct disease-causing genetic errors by inducing the targeted expression of novel proteins. The PMO chemistry platform is highly adaptable, and we have developed next-generation PMO-based chemistries for advancing RNA-targeted therapeutics. These next-generation chemistries are specifically designed to enhance tissue targeting, intracellular delivery, target selectivity and drug potency. One of these novel technologies is based on cell-penetrating peptide-conjugated PMO (“PPMO”). The PPMO features covalent attachment of a cell-penetrating peptide to a PMO with the goal of enhanced delivery into the cell. Our most advanced PPMO product candidate is SRP-5051, which is designed to treat DMD in patients with genetic mutations amenable to exon 51 skipping. In 2017, we commenced a first-in-human, single ascending dose, Phase 1 clinical trial for this product candidate. In 2019, we commenced a multiple ascending dose study for the treatment of DMD with SRP-5051 in patients who are amenable to exon 51 skipping, and we expect to have safety and dosing insights for this study by the middle of 2020. As part of our multifaceted approach to DMD, we are also developing gene therapy technologies to treat DMD. We are clinically developing a product candidate, SRP-9001, that aims to express a smaller but still functional version of dystrophin (“micro-dystrophin”). We use a unique adeno-associated virus (“AAV”) vector called AAVrh.74 to transport the transgene – the genetic material that will make the protein of interest – to the target cells. Micro-dystrophin is used because naturally-occurring dystrophin is too large to fit in an AAV. On October 3, 2018, Nationwide Children’s Hospital (“Nationwide”) presented positive results from a Phase 1/2a clinical trial testing SRP-9001 in four individuals with DMD enrolled in the trial. On March 25, 2019, we presented nine-month functional and creatine kinase (“CK”) data from baseline from these four individuals, and twelve-month CK data from baseline from one of these individuals. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we commenced a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with the goal to establish the functional benefits of micro-dystrophin expression. We have dosed all 41 participants in that trial and have begun dosing participants in the crossover phase of the study. We plan to commence a trial evaluating SRP-9001 using commercial supply in the middle of 2020, pending regulatory feedback. -4- We are also develop ing gene therapy programs for various forms of LGMDs. Our most advanced LGMD product candidate , SRP - 9 0 03 , is designed to transfer a gene that codes for and restores beta-sarcoglycan protein with the goal of restoring the dystrophin associated protein complex. SRP-9003 utilizes the AAVrh.74 vector, the same vector used in SRP-9001 . We commenced a Phase 1/2a trial of SRP-9 0 03 in the fourth quarter of 2018 . O n February 27, 2019, we announced positive two-month biopsy data from the first three-patient cohort dosed in the SRP-90 0 3 trial and on October 4, 2019, we announced positive nine-month functional data from these three patients . We have recently dosed one additional cohort of three patients at a higher dose per the study protocol . We expect to have the results from the second cohort and to make a dose selection in the third quarter of 2020 . Our pipeline includes more than 40 programs at various stages of discovery, pre-clinical and clinical development, reflecting our aspiration to apply our multifaceted approach and expertise in precision genetic medicine to make a profound difference in the lives of patients suffering from rare diseases. Objectives and Business Strategy We believe that our proprietary technology platforms and collaborations can be used to develop novel pharmaceutical products to treat a broad range of diseases and address key currently-unmet medical needs. We intend to leverage our technology platforms, organizational capabilities, collaborations and resources to lead the field of precision genetic medicines, including the treatment of rare, neuromuscular and other diseases, with a diversified portfolio of product candidates. In pursuit of this objective, we intend to focus on the following activities: • continuing to build our gene therapy engine, including developing gene therapy product candidates, operationalizing our manufacturing strategy and furthering our commercial capabilities in preparation for potential regulatory approvals; • advancing our RNA technologies (e.g., PMO and PPMO), launching potential approved products and supporting commercialization of approved products; • investing in next-generation precision medicine through internal research, strategic partnerships, collaborations and other potential opportunities; and • continuing to nurture our culture, which is based on strong patient focus, bias to action, a self-starter mentality, smart and appropriate risk-taking and high ethics. Core Therapeutic Areas DMD : We primarily focus on rapidly advancing the development of our potentially disease-modifying pipeline of exon-skipping, gene therapy and gene editing product candidates targeting DMD. DMD is a rare X-linked recessive genetic disorder affecting children (primarily males) that is characterized by progressive muscle deterioration and weakness. It is the most common type of muscular dystrophy. DMD is caused by an absence of dystrophin, a protein that protects muscle cells. The absence of dystrophin in muscle cells leads to significant cell damage and ultimately causes muscle cell death and fibrotic replacement. In the absence of dystrophin protein, affected individuals generally experience the following symptoms, although disease severity and life expectancy vary: • muscle damage characterized by inflammation, fibrosis and loss of myofibers beginning at an early age; • muscle weakness and progressive loss of muscle function beginning in the first few years of life; • decline of ambulation and respiratory function after the age of seven; • total loss of ambulation in the pre-teenage or early teenage years; • progressive loss of upper extremity function during mid- to late-teens; and • respiratory and/or cardiac failure, resulting in death before the age of 30. LGMDs are autosomal recessive, monogenic, rare neuromuscular diseases caused by missense and deletion mutations. These diseases affect males and females equally. Some types of LGMDs affect skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle. More severe forms of LGMDs mimic DMD. LGMDs as a class affect an estimated range of approximately 1 in every 14,500 to 1 in every 123,000 individuals. Currently, there are no available treatment options for LGMDs. MPS IIIA is a rare inherited neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder characterized by intractable behavioral problems and developmental regression resulting in early death. It is caused by mutations in the SGSH gene, which encodes an enzyme called Heparan-N-sulfamidase necessary for heparan sulfate (“HS”) recycling in cells. The disrupted lysosomal degradation and resulting storage of HS and glycolipids such as gangliosides leads to severe neurodegeneration. MPS IIIA affects approximately 1 in 100,000 individuals and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. There are currently no treatment options for patients. -5- CMT is a group of hereditary, degenerative nerve diseases that are caused by mutations in genes that produce proteins involved in the structure and function of either the peripheral nerve axon or the myelin sheath. CMT can cause degeneration of motor skills, resulting in muscle weakness, and limiting patients’ ability to walk or use their hands, and in some cases, can cause degeneration of sensory nerves, resulting in a reduced ability to feel heat, cold, and pain. CMT affects approximately 1 in every 2,500 individuals, while CMT type 1A, which is most often caused by an extra copy of the PMP22 gene, affects approximately 50,000 patients in the U.S. Most patients are diagnosed at infancy, while other patients develop symptoms at adolescence. Currently, there are no available treatment options. Our Commercial Products EXONDYS 51 , our first commercial product, approved by the FDA on September 19, 2016, is indicated for the treatment of DMD in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 51 skipping. EXONDYS 51 uses our PMO chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 51 of the dystrophin gene. PMO-based compounds are synthetic compounds that bind to complementary sequences of RNA by standard Watson-Crick nucleobase pairing. The two key structural differences between PMO-based compounds and naturally occurring RNA are that the PMO nucleobases are bound to synthetic morpholino rings instead of ribose rings, and the morpholino rings are linked by phosphorodiamidate groups instead of phosphodiester groups. Replacement of the negatively charged phosphodiester in RNA with the uncharged phosphorodiamidate group in PMO eliminates linkage ionization at physiological pH. Due to these modifications, PMO-based compounds are resistant to degradation by plasma and intracellular enzymes. Unlike the RNA-targeted technologies such as siRNAs and DNA gapmers, PMO-based compounds operate by steric blockade rather than by cellular enzymatic degradation to achieve their biological effects. Thus, PMOs use a fundamentally different mechanism from other RNA-targeted technologies. We are in the process of conducting various EXONDYS 51 clinical trials, including studies that are required to comply with our post-marketing FDA requirements/commitments to verify and describe the clinical benefit of EXONDYS 51. EXONDYS 51 targets the most frequent series of mutations that cause DMD. Approximately 13% of DMD patients are amenable to exon 51 skipping. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, the Company recorded net revenue of $380.7 million, $301.0 million, and $154.6 million, respectively, related to the sale of EXONDYS 51. VYONDYS 53 , our second commercial product, approved by the FDA on December 12, 2019, is indicated for the treatment of DMD in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 53 skipping. VYONDYS 53 uses our PMO chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 53 of the dystrophin gene. We are in the process of conducting various VYONDYS 53 clinical trials, including studies that are required to comply with our post-marketing FDA requirements/commitments to verify and describe the clinical benefit of VYONDYS 53. VYONDYS 53 targets the second most frequent series of mutations that cause DMD. Up to 8% of DMD patients are amenable to exon 53 skipping. As of December 31, 2019, we had commenced shipment of VYONDYS 53 but revenue from VYONDYS 53 was immaterial. Our Pipeline – Key Programs Casimersen (SRP-4045) uses our PMO chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 45 of the DMD gene. Casimersen is designed to bind to exon 45 of dystrophin pre-mRNA, resulting in exclusion, or “skipping”, of this exon during mRNA processing in patients with genetic mutations that are amenable to exon 45 skipping. We are enrolling and dosing patients in ESSENCE (4045-301), our Phase 3 placebo controlled confirmatory trial in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 45 or 53 skipping using casimersen and golodirsen, respectively. On March 28, 2019, we announced results from our interim analysis of muscle biopsy endpoints comparing casimersen treatment to placebo in the ESSENCE study. In January 2020, we commenced a rolling submission of an NDA to the FDA seeking accelerated approval for casimersen . SRP-5051 uses our next-generation chemistry platform, PPMO, and our exon-skipping technology to skip exon 51 of the dystrophin gene. The PPMO technology features covalent attachment of a cell-penetrating peptide to a PMO with the goal of enhanced delivery into the cell. In pre-clinical research, our proprietary class of PPMO compounds demonstrated an increase in dystrophin production and a more durable response compared to PMO. In addition, PPMO treatment in non-human primates results in high levels of exon-skipping in skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle tissues. Pre-clinical trials also indicate that PPMOs may require less frequent dosing than PMOs, and that PPMOs could potentially be tailored to reach other organs beyond muscle. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we commenced a first-in-human, single ascending dose, trial for the treatment of DMD using SRP-5051 in patients who are amenable to exon 51 skipping. In 2019, we commenced a multiple ascending dose study for the treatment of DMD with SRP-5051 in patients who are amenable to exon 51 skipping, and we expect to have safety and dosing insights by the middle of 2020. -6- SRP-9001 ( DMD, micro-dystrophin gene therapy program) , aims to express micro-dystrophin – a smaller but still functional version of dystrophin. A unique, engineered micro-dystrophin is used because naturally-occurring dystrophin is too large to fit in an AAV vector. SRP-9001 employs the AAVrh . 74 vector, which is designed to be systemically and robustly delivered to skeletal, diaphragm and cardiac muscle without promiscuously crossing the blood brain barrier, which we believe makes it a strong candidate to treat peripheral neuromuscular diseases. An MHCK7 promoter was chosen for its ability to robustly express in the heart, which is critically important for patients with DMD, who typically die from pulmonary or cardiac complications. Lastly, the transgene was designed to maintain spectrin-like repeats 2 and 3, which has been reported to be critical to maintaining muscle force. In the fourth quarter of 2017, an investigational new drug (“IND”) application for the micro-dystrophin gene therapy program was cleared by the FDA, and a Phase 1/2a clinical trial in individuals with DMD was initiated. On October 3, 2018, Nationwide presented what we believe to be positive updated results from the Phase 1/2a clinical trial in four individuals with DMD enrolled in the trial. On March 25, 2019, we presented nine-month functional and CK data from baseline from these four individuals, and twelve-month CK data from baseline from one of these individuals. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we commenced a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of SRP-9001 with the goal to establish the functional benefits of micro-dystrophin expressions. We have dosed all 41 participants in that trial and have begun dosing participants in the crossover phase of the study. We plan to commence a trial evaluating SRP-9001 using commercial supply in the middle of 2020, pending regulatory feedback. SRP-9003 (LGMD, gene therapy program) . We are developing gene therapy programs for various types of LGMDs. Our LGMD programs use the AAVrh.74 vector, the same vector used in the micro-dystrophin gene therapy program, to transfect a restorative gene. The most advanced of our LGMD product candidates, SRP-9003, aims to treat LGMD2E, also known as beta-sarcoglycanopathy, a severe and debilitating form of LGMD characterized by progressive muscle fiber loss, inflammation and muscle fiber replacement with fat and fibrotic tissue. SRP-9003 is designed to transfect a gene that codes for and restores beta-sarcoglycan protein with the goal of restoring the dystrophin associated protein complex. SRP-9003 has generated positive pre-clinical safety and efficacy data utilizing the AAVrh.74 vector. A Phase 1/2a trial of SRP-9003 was commenced in the fourth quarter of 2018. On February 27, 2019, we announced positive two-month biopsy data from the first three-patient cohort dosed in the SRP-9003 trial, and on October 4, 2019, we announced positive nine-month functional data from these three patients. We have recently dosed one additional cohort of three patients at a higher dose per the study protocol. We expect to have the results from the second cohort and make a dose selection in the third quarter of 2020. LYS-SAF 302 . We are collaborating with Lysogene S.A. (“Lysogene”) to develop a gene therapy, LYS-SAF302, to treat MPS IIIA. LYS-SAF302 is an AAV-mediated gene therapy, the goal of which is to replace the faulty N-sulfoglucosamine sulfohydrolase (“SGSH”) gene with a healthy copy of the gene. LYS-SAF302 employs the AAVrh.10 virus, chosen for its ability to target the CNS. Proof-of-concept was established in MPS IIIA pre-clinical models demonstrating strong expression, broad distribution, and the ability of the compound to correct lysosomal storage defects by producing the missing enzyme. Lysogene is conducting a global Phase 2/3 clinical trial of LYS-SAF302 (AAVance), aiming at evaluating the effectiveness of a one-time delivery of an AAVrh.10 virus carrying the N-SGSH gene. We expect to complete dosing in this trial in the first half of 2020. -7- The chart below summarizes the status of our programs, including those with our strategic partners: -8- Manufacturing, Supply and Distribution We have developed proprietary state-of-the-art Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (“CMC”) and manufacturing capabilities that allow synthesis and purification of our products and product candidates to support both clinical development as well as commercialization. Our current main focus in manufacturing is to continue scaling up production of our PMO-based therapies and optimizing manufacturing for PPMO and gene therapy-based product candidates. We have entered into certain manufacturing and supply arrangements with third-party suppliers which will in part utilize these capabilities to support production of certain of our product candidates and their components. In 2017, we opened a facility in Andover, Massachusetts, which significantly enhanced our research and development manufacturing capabilities. However, we currently do not have internal large scale Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMP”) manufacturing capabilities to produce our products and product candidates for commercial and/or clinical use. For our current and future manufacturing needs, we have entered into supply agreements with specialized contract manufacturing organizations (each a “CMO”) to produce custom raw materials, the active pharmaceutical Ingredients (“APIs”), drug product and finished goods for our products and product candidates for both commercial and clinical use. All of our CMO partners have extensive technical expertise, GMP experience and experience manufacturing our specific technology. For our commercial DMD program, we have commenced work with our existing manufacturers to increase product capacity from mid-scale to large-scale. While there are a limited number of companies that can produce raw materials and APIs in the quantities and with the quality and purity that we require for our commercial products, based on our diligence to date, we believe our current network of manufacturing partners are able to fulfill these requirements, and are capable of expanding capacity as needed. Additionally, we have, and will continue to evaluate further relationships with additional suppliers to increase overall capacity as well as further reduce risks associated with reliance on a limited number of suppliers for manufacturing. Our commercial products are distributed in the U.S. through a limited network of home infusion specialty pharmacy providers that deliver the medication to patients and a specialty distributor that distributes our products to hospitals and hospital outpatient clinics. With respect to the pre-commercial distribution of our products to patients outside of the U.S., we have contracted with third party distributors and service providers to distribute our products in certain countries through our ex-U.S. early access programs (“EAP”). We plan to continue building out our network for commercial distribution in jurisdictions in which our products are approved. Our gene therapy manufacturing capabilities have been greatly enhanced through partnerships with Brammer Bio LLC, which has recently been acquired by Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (“Brammer”), Paragon Bioservices, Inc., which has recently been acquired by Catalent, Inc. (“Paragon”) and Aldevron LLC (“Aldevron”). We have adopted a hybrid development and manufacturing strategy in which we are building internal manufacturing expertise relative to all aspects of AAV-based manufacturing, including gene therapy and gene editing supply, while closely partnering with first-in-class manufacturing partners to expedite development and commercialization of our gene therapy programs. We expect that our partnerships with Brammer and Paragon will support our clinical and commercial manufacturing capacity for our micro-dystrophin DMD gene therapy programs and LGMD programs, while also acting as a manufacturing platform for potential future gene therapy programs. The collaboration integrates process development, clinical production and testing, and commercial manufacturing. Aldevron is expected to provide GMP-grade plasmid for our SRP-9001 micro-dystrophin DMD gene therapy program and LGMD programs, as well as plasmid source material for future gene therapy programs, such as CMT, MPS IIIA and other neuromuscular and CNS related disorders. Manufacturers and suppliers of our commercial products and product candidates are subject to the FDA’s current GMP (“cGMP”) requirements and other rules and regulations prescribed by foreign regulatory authorities. We depend on our third-party partners for continued compliance with cGMP requirements and applicable foreign standards. Material Agreements We believe that our RNA-targeted and gene therapy technologies could be broadly applicable for the potential development of pharmaceutical products in many therapeutic areas. To further exploit our core technologies, we have and may continue to enter into research, development or commercialization alliances with universities, hospitals, independent research centers, non-profit organizations, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and other entities for specific molecular targets or selected disease indications. We may also selectively pursue opportunities to access certain intellectual property rights that complement our internal portfolio through license agreements or other arrangements. Roche License, Collaboration, and Option Agreement On December 21, 2019, we entered into a License, Collaboration, and Option Agreement (the “Collaboration Agreement”) with F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd (“Roche”) pursuant to which we granted Roche an exclusive license under certain of our intellectual property rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize SRP-9001 in all countries outside of the U.S. We retained all rights to SRP-9001 in the U.S. -9- Also, under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, Roche granted us a license to use certain of its intellectual property rights to perform development activities worldwide under a joint global development plan , commercialize SRP-9001 in the U . S . , and perform certain manufacturing and medical affairs activities worldwide . Such license is non-exclusive under Roche’s background intellectual property rights , exclusive in the U.S. under intellectual property rights developed by Roche under the Collaboration Agreement , and non-exclusive outside the U.S. under intellectual property rights developed by Roche under the Collaboration Agreement . We intend to manufacture and supply all clinical and commercial supply of SRP-9001. Roche Options and Negotiation Rights Pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, we granted Roche an exclusive option to obtain an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize the following products outside of the U.S.: (i) certain exon-skipping products that target the dystrophin gene to induce exon skipping, including eteplirsen, golodirsen, casimersen and SRP-5051; (ii) certain gene therapy products other than SRP-9001 that encode and directly express dystrophin or a derivative thereof; and (iii) certain gene-editing products that modify, repair, or activate an endogenous dysfunctional dystrophin gene. The products subject to Roche’s options are collectively referred to as the “Option Products.” Upon option exercise, the Option Product that is the subject of the option exercise will be included under the Collaboration Agreement as a product licensed to Roche subject to similar obligations, including with respect to development, manufacturing, commercialization, and cost-sharing as those that apply to SRP-9001. Pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, Roche has a right of first negotiation if we seek to grant a third-party license to (a) commercialize SRP-9001 in the U.S. or (b) commercialize any of our LGMDs products. Exclusivity Other than under the Collaboration Agreement, Roche may not perform any clinical trials for, or commercialize, any gene therapy product, gene-editing product, or antisense oligonucleotide for DMD for a period of five years following the execution of the Collaboration Agreement. The exclusivity period for one or more types of products may be extended if Roche exercises its option with respect to one or more exon-skipping products, gene therapy products, or gene-editing products, in each case, for a period of five years from the time of option exercise. Development The parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct development activities with respect to SRP-9001 under the Collaboration Agreement pursuant to agreed-upon development plans. We will perform all development activities directed to obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for SRP-9001 in the U.S. and the European Union (“EU”), as set forth in a joint global development plan. Subject to certain exceptions, the parties will share the costs of the development activities under such joint global development plan. Roche will perform all development activities set forth in a territory-specific development plan for SRP-9001, including additional activities not set forth in the joint global development plan that are specifically directed to obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for SRP-9001 outside of the U.S. Roche will be solely responsible for costs arising from the territory-specific development plan for SRP-9001. Governance Governing committees will facilitate collaboration between the parties with respect to development, manufacturing, medical affairs, intellectual property protection, and commercialization of SRP-9001 and any other licensed products. Financial Terms In February 2020, Roche and Roche Finance Ltd, an affiliate of Roche (“Roche Finance”), together paid us an up-front payment of $1.2 billion, comprised of $750.0 million in cash from Roche and approximately $400.0 million from Roche Finance in exchange for 2,522,227 shares of our common stock, priced at $158.59 per share under the Stock Purchase Agreement described below. Additionally, we are eligible to receive up to $1.7 billion in regulatory and sales milestone payments with respect to SRP-9001. In addition, the Collaboration Agreement provides that Roche will pay us royalties on net sales of SRP-9001, anticipated to be in the mid-teens. In the event that Roche chooses to exercise its option with respect to one or more Option Products, we will be paid an option exercise fee upon each such exercise and the Option Products that are the subject of the option exercise will be subject to separate milestone payments and royalties on sales of such Option Product. -10- Term; Termination Unless earlier terminated as described below, the Collaboration Agreement will continue with respect to SRP-9001 or any Option Product for which Roche has exercised its option, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until the end of the royalty term for such product in such country. The royalty term expires on the later of (a) twelve years after first commercial sale in such country, (b) loss of regulatory exclusivity in such country and (c) expiration of all valid claims of specific licensed patents in such country. Either party may terminate the Collaboration Agreement for the other party’s material breach, if such breach is not cured within a specified cure period. If Roche breaches its development or commercialization diligence obligations with respect to a licensed product or fails to develop or commercialize a particular licensed product in a particular region for a specified period of time, then we may terminate the Collaboration Agreement with respect to such licensed products in such regions. Roche may terminate the Collaboration Agreement if we fail to supply SRP-9001 to Roche in accordance with the terms of the Collaboration Agreement and the supply agreements to be entered into between the parties. Roche may also terminate the Collaboration Agreement for convenience with extended advance notice, in its entirety or on a licensed product-by-licensed product and region-by-region basis. The foregoing description of the terms of the Collaboration Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Collaboration Agreement, a copy of which is filed as an exhibit to this Annual Report. Stock Purchase Agreement On December 21, 2019, pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Roche Finance (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”) pursuant to which, in February 2020, we issued and sold 2,522,227 shares (the “Shares”) of common stock to Roche Finance in a private placement for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $400.0 million, or $158.59 per share. The Shares are subject to lock-up restrictions, which, without our prior approval, prohibit Roche Finance from selling the Shares for a period of 180 days after the closing of the Share issuance. The Stock Purchase Agreement contains other customary terms and conditions, including mutual representations, warranties, and covenants. Myonexus On May 3, 2018, we purchased from Myonexus, a privately-held Delaware corporation, a warrant to purchase common stock of Myonexus (the “Warrant”), which, in combination with amendments to the Myonexus certificate of incorporation, provided us with an exclusive option (the “Option”) to acquire Myonexus. In consideration for the Warrant, we made an up-front payment of $60.0 million to Myonexus. On February 27, 2019, we announced that we exercised the exclusive option to acquire Myonexus and, on April 4, 2019, we paid the Myonexus shareholders approximately $173.8 million and completed the acquisition of Myonexus. We are required to make contingent payments to the former shareholders of Myonexus upon achievement of a threshold amount of net sales of Myonexus products and the receipt and subsequent sale of a priority review voucher with respect to a Myonexus product. BioMarin License Agreement On July 17, 2017, we executed a License Agreement (as amended on April 14, 2019, the “License Agreement”) with BioMarin Leiden Holding BV, BioMarin Nederlands BV and BioMarin Technologies BV (collectively, “BioMarin”), pursuant to which BioMarin granted us a royalty-bearing, worldwide license under patent rights (“Licensed Patents”) and know-how (“Licensed Know-How”) controlled by BioMarin with respect to BioMarin’s DMD program, which are potentially necessary or useful for the treatment of DMD, to practice and exploit the Licensed Patents and Licensed Know-How in all fields of use and for all purposes, including to develop and commercialize antisense oligonucleotide products that target one or more exons of the dystrophin gene to induce exon skipping, including eteplirsen and golodirsen (collectively, the “Products”). The license granted by BioMarin is exclusive, even as to BioMarin, with respect to the Licensed Patents, and is non-exclusive with respect to Licensed Know-How. Under the License Agreement, BioMarin has the option to convert the exclusive license under the Licensed Patents into a co-exclusive license (co-exclusive with BioMarin) (“BioMarin Co-Exclusive Option”). -11- Under the terms of the License Agreement, we were required to pay BioMarin an up - front payment of $15 .0 million, and BioMarin is eligible to receive up to $20 .0 million from us per dystrophin gene exon (other than exon 51) targeted by one or more Products in specified regulatory milestones, as well as an additional $10 .0 million milestone, payable following the regulatory approval of eteplirsen by the EMA . BioMarin is also eligible to receive $15 .0 million from us upon the achievement of $650 .0 million in sales, as well as royalties segmented by specified geographic markets, in some jurisdictions dependent on the existence of a patent, ranging from four (4) to eight (8) percentages of net sales on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis. Milestones and royalties are payable with respect to eteplirsen (an exon 51 skipping Product), golodirsen (an exon 53 skipping Product), casimersen (an exon 45 skipping Product) and other Products. For eteplirsen, golodirsen and casimersen, the royalty term will expire upon March 31, 2024 in the U.S., upon December 31, 2024 in the EU and no later than December 31, 2024 in other countries provided certain conditions are met. For Products other than exon 51 skipping Products, exon 53 skipping Products and exon 45 skipping Products, the royalty term will end on a country-by country basis upon expiration of granted Licensed Patents covering the applicable Product. The royalties for all Products are subject to reduction upon BioMarin’s exercise of the BioMarin Co-Exclusive Option. All royalties are subject to further potential reductions, including for generic competition and, under specified conditions, for a specified portion of payments that we may become required to pay under third-party license agreements, subject to a maximum royalty reduction. Unless earlier terminated, the License Agreement will expire upon the expiration of the last-to-expire royalty term. Either party may terminate the License Agreement in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach. BioMarin may also terminate the License Agreement on a Licensed Patent-by-Licensed Patent basis under specified circumstances relating to patent challenges by us. Settlement Agreement On July 17, 2017, Sarepta and The University of Western Australia (“UWA”) on the one hand, and the BioMarin Parties and Academisch Ziekenhuis Leiden (“AZL”) on the other hand (collectively, the “Settlement Parties”), executed a Settlement Agreement pursuant to which all legal actions in the U.S. and certain legal actions in Europe (the “Actions”) would be stopped or withdrawn as between the Settlement Parties. Specifically, the terms of the Settlement Agreement required that existing efforts pursuing ongoing litigation and opposition proceedings would be stopped as between the Settlement Parties, and the Settlement Parties would cooperate to withdraw the Actions before the European Patent Office (except for actions involving third parties), the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the High Court of Justice of England and Wales, except for the cross-appeal of the Interlocutory Decision of the Opposition Division dated April 15, 2013 of the European Patent Office of EP 1619249B1 (“EP ‘249 Appeal”) in which Sarepta agreed to withdraw its appeal and BioMarin/AZL agreed to continue with its appeal with Sarepta having oversight of the continued appeal by BioMarin/AZL. Additionally, under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the Settlement Parties agreed to release each other and the customers, end-users, agents, suppliers, distributors, resellers, contractors, consultants, services and partners of Sarepta or BioMarin (as applicable) from claims and damages related to (i) the patent rights controlled by the releasing party that are involved in the Actions, (ii) with respect to Sarepta and UWA, its patent rights related to the patent rights involved in the Actions, and (iii) with respect to BioMarin and AZL, all of the Licensed Patents and Licensed Know-How. Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Sarepta made an up-front payment of $20.0 million to BioMarin. University of Western Australia In April 2013, we entered into an agreement with UWA under which an existing exclusive license agreement between the two parties was amended and restated and, in June 2016, we entered into the first amendment to the license agreement (the “UWA License Agreement”). The UWA License Agreement grants us specific rights to compounds for the treatment of DMD by inducing exon skipping. EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53 and casimersen fall under the scope of the license agreement. Under the UWA License Agreement, we are required to make payments of up to $6.0 million in the aggregate to UWA based on the successful achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones relating to EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53 and up to four additional product candidates. As of December 31, 2019, $2.7 million of the $6.0 million development and regulatory milestone payments has been made. We are also obligated to make payments to UWA of up to $20.0 million upon the achievement of certain sales milestones. Additionally, we are required to pay a low-single-digit percentage royalty on net sales of products covered by issued patents licensed from UWA during the term of the UWA License Agreement. However, we have the option to purchase future royalties up-front for a one-time payment to UWA of $23.0 million. Currently, the latest date on which an issued patent covered by the UWA License Agreement expires is November 2030 (excluding any patent term extension, supplemental protection certificate or pediatric extensions that may be available); however, patents granted from pending patent applications could result in a later expiration date. -12- Key Strategic Alliances In connection with our multi-front battle against DMD and other rare neuromuscular diseases, we have entered into multiple partnering opportunities, including the ones described below. We believe that these collaborations, taken along with our own programs, represent a comprehensive approach to treating these rare neuromuscular diseases. Nationwide Children’s Hospital In December 2015, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Nationwide to acquire exclusive rights to its GALGT2 gene therapy program for neuromuscular related disorders. In addition, in December 2016, we entered into an exclusive option agreement with Nationwide to acquire exclusive rights to their micro-dystrophin gene therapy program as well as a sponsored research agreement to conduct pre-IND research and conduct the first clinical trial with the lead micro-dystrophin gene therapy. In October 2018, we exercised our exclusive license option and an option under the sponsored research agreement and entered into an exclusive license agreement with Nationwide to acquire exclusive rights to its micro-dystrophin gene therapy program. Furthermore, in October 2018, we entered into an exclusive option agreement with Nationwide with respect to exclusive rights to its NT-3 gene therapy program for the treatment of certain CMT neuropathy subtypes, including CMT Type 1A. The option agreement contains pre-determined economic terms for the exclusive license to be entered into upon us exercising our option. In addition, in March 2019, we entered into an exclusive option agreement with Nationwide with respect to exclusive rights to its calpain-3 gene therapy program for the treatment of LGMD Type 2A. The option agreement contains pre-determined economic terms for the exclusive license to be entered into upon us exercising our option. Lysogene In October 2018, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Lysogene, a gene therapy company focused on the treatment of orphan diseases of the CNS, for the development of a gene therapy, LYS-SAF302, to treat MPS IIIA. Concomitantly, we also entered into an option with Lysogene to acquire an exclusive license to an additional CNS-targeted gene therapy candidate. Lysogene is responsible for completion of the pivotal trial for LYS-SAF302. We have exclusive commercial rights to LYS-SAF302 and exclusive option rights for the additional CNS-targeted gene therapy program in the U.S. and all territories outside of Europe, and Lysogene will retain exclusive commercial rights to each program in Europe. We will be responsible for global manufacturing of LYS-SAF302 and will supply Lysogene for its territory. If all milestones are met, we may be required to pay up to $130.8 million in development and commercial milestones and tiered royalties upon commercialization. Duke University In October 2017, we entered into a sponsored research and exclusive option agreement with Duke University, granting us an exclusive option to an exclusive license to intellectual property and technology related to certain CRISPR/Cas9 technology developed in the laboratory of Charles A. Gersbach, Ph.D. The underlying premise of Dr. Gersbach’s approach is to restore dystrophin expression by removing or “excising” exons from the dystrophin gene. This includes a strategy to excise exons potentially enabling treatment for a majority of the DMD patient population. Genethon In May 2017, we entered into a sponsored research agreement with Genethon, under which we have been collaborating with Genethon on the pre-clinical development of its micro-dystrophin gene therapy products for the treatment of DMD. In November 2019, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Genethon, under which we will collaborate and share costs with Genethon on the clinical development of such products for the treatment of DMD. Under such agreement, we received the exclusive right to commercialize such products in the majority of the world (primarily excluding the EU). For the rights we received under such agreement, we made an up-front payment of $28.0 million; may be required to pay up to $236.3 million in development, regulatory and sales milestones; and upon commercialization, will be required to make tiered royalty payments based on net sales of licensed products. -13- StrideBio On November 13, 2019, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with StrideBio, Inc. (“StrideBio”), a leading developer of novel AAV capsids, to develop in vivo AAV-based therapies for up to eight CNS and neuromuscular targets. Pursuant to the agreement, we were granted an exclusive license on selected targets to leverage StrideBio’s capsid technology intended to enhance specific tropism to tissues of interest and evade neutralizing antibodies. StrideBio will conduct all IND enabling research, development and manufacturing for the first four CNS targets, which are MECP2 (Rett syndrome), SCN1A (Dravet syndrome), UBE3A (Angelman syndrome), and NPC1 (Niemann-Pick). Additionally, we have an exclusive option for up to four additional targets based on StrideBio’s capsid technology. Under the terms of the agreement, StrideBio will be responsible for AAV capsid development, non-clinical development and manufacturing of preclinical candidates to be selected for advancement into clinical studies. The parties will also share early clinical development activities for certain selected targets, with Sarepta responsible for late stage development and commercialization of all targets. StrideBio received up-front consideration of $46.9 million, of which $29.4 million was in the form of Sarepta common stock and the balance in cash. In addition, StrideBio will receive significant future development, regulatory and commercial milestones upon the achievement of specified milestone events for each of the four programs. StrideBio will also receive royalties on worldwide net sales of any commercial products developed through the collaboration. Sarepta has also obtained an exclusive option to expand the collaboration to include up to an additional four targets with an up-front option payment of up to $42.5 million along with future downstream milestone and royalty payments, while StrideBio has an option to obtain co-development and co-commercial rights in the U.S. to one of the collaboration targets. In addition, Sarepta has made a commitment to invest in StrideBio’s next financing round that meets certain conditions. Patents and Proprietary Rights Our success depends in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain exclusivity for our products, product candidates and platform technologies. We typically rely on a combination of patent protection and regulatory exclusivity to maintain exclusivity for our products and product candidates, whereas exclusivity for our platform technologies is generally based on patent protection and trade secret protection. In addition to patent protection, regulatory exclusivity, and trade secret protection, we also protect our products, product candidates and platform technologies with copyrights, trademarks, and contractual protections. We actively seek patent protection for our product candidates and certain of our proprietary technologies by filing patent applications in the U.S. and other countries as appropriate. These patent applications are directed to various inventions, including, but not limited to, active ingredients, pharmaceutical formulations, methods of use, and manufacturing methods. In addition, we actively acquire exclusive rights to third party patents and patent applications to protect our in-licensed product candidates and corresponding platform technologies. We do not have patents or patent applications in every jurisdiction where there is a potential commercial market for our product candidates. For each of our programs, our decision to seek patent protection in specific foreign markets, in addition to the U.S., is based on many factors, including: • our available resources; • the number and types of patents already filed or pending; • the likelihood of success of the product candidate; • the size of the commercial market; • the presence of a potential competitor in the market; and • whether the legal authorities in the market effectively enforce patent rights. We continually evaluate our patent portfolio and patent strategy and believe our owned and licensed patents and patent applications provide us with a competitive advantage; however, if markets where we do not have patents or patent applications become commercially important, our business may be adversely affected. A discussion of certain risks and uncertainties that may affect our patent position, regulatory exclusivities and other proprietary rights is set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors included in this report, and a discussion of legal proceedings related to the key patents protecting our products and product candidates are set forth below in the footnotes to the tables in this section. -14- Certain of our product candidates are in therapeutic areas that have been the subject of many years of extensive research and development by academic organizations and third parties who may control patents or other intellectual property that they might assert against us, should one or more of our product candidates in these therapeutic areas succeed in obtaining regulatory approval and thereafter be commercialized. We continually evaluate the intellectual property rights of others in these areas in order to determine whether a claim of infringement may be made by others against us. Should we determine that a third party has intellectual property rights that could impact our ability to freely market a compound , we consider a number of factors in determining how best to prepare for the commercialization of any such product candidate. In making this determination we consider, among other things, the stage of development of our product candidate, the anticipated date of first regulatory approval, whether we believe the intellectual property rights of others are valid, whether we believe we infringe the intellectual property rights of others, whether a license is available upon commercially reasonable terms, whether we will seek to challenge the intellectual property rights of others, the term of the rights, and the likelihood of and liability resulting from an adverse outcome should we be found to infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Currently, U.S. patents, as well as most foreign patents, are generally effective for 20 years from the date the earliest regular application was filed. In some countries, the patent term may be extended to recapture a portion of the term lost during regulatory review of the claimed therapeutic. For example, in the U.S., under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may be eligible for patent term extension (for up to 5 years, but not beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval) as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. In the U.S., only one patent may be extended for any product based on FDA delay. In addition to patent term extension, patents in the U.S. may be granted additional term due to delays at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) during prosecution of a patent application. We actively strive to maximize the potential for patent protection for our products and product candidates in accordance with the law. Key Patents & Regulatory Exclusivities Our products, product candidates and our technologies are primarily protected by composition of matter and methods of use patents and patent applications. A summary of granted composition of matter and/or methods of use patents that we own or control in the U.S. and Europe, which cover our products and late-stage clinical product candidates, is provided below. To the extent the product or product candidate indicated above the tables that immediately follow the name of such product is covered by a patent that is licensed to Sarepta, we may owe milestones and/or royalties to the indicated licensor in connection with the development and/or commercial sale of the product or product candidate.

Additional patent protection in the U.S., Europe (EP) or other countries or regions through pending or granted foreign counterparts may be available. ** Stated expiration dates do not account for any patent term extension, supplemental protection certificate or pediatric extensions that may be available. In addition to the foregoing composition of matter and method of use patents that protect eteplirsen, casimersen and golodirsen, we either solely own or exclusively license from UWA, BioMarin or AZL patents and patent applications in the U.S. and in major foreign markets that provide additional protection for eteplirsen, casimersen, and golodirsen, which cover the composition of matter, preparation and/or uses of the products and product candidates. These patents, and patent applications, if granted, would expire through at least 2038, such expiration dates not accounting for any patent term extension, patent term adjustment, supplemental protection certificate or pediatric extensions that may be available. Platform Technologies We separately own patents and patent applications in the U.S. and in major foreign markets that cover our proprietary PMO-based platform technologies (e.g., PPMO, PMOplus, PMO-X). These patents, and patent applications, if granted, expire through at least 2038, such expiration dates not accounting for any patent term extension, supplemental protection certificate or pediatric extensions that may be available. Trademarks Our trademarks are important to us and are generally filed to protect our corporate brand, our products and platform technologies. We typically file trademark applications and pursue their registration in the U.S., Europe and other markets in which we anticipate using such trademarks. We are the owner of multiple federal trademark registrations in the U.S. including, but not limited to, Sarepta, Sarepta Therapeutics, the double-helix logo, EXONDYS, and EXONDYS 51. In addition, we have multiple pending trademark applications in the U.S. and in major foreign markets, including, but not limited to, VYONDYS and VYONDYS 53. Trademark protection varies in accordance with local law, and continues in some countries as long as the trademark is used and in other countries as long as the trademark is registered. Trademark registrations generally are for fixed but renewable terms. Government Regulation The testing, manufacturing, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, exportation and marketing of our products are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S. and in other countries. In the U.S., the FDA, under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations, regulates pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending marketing applications, withdrawal of approval of approved products, warning letters, untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, civil penalties and/or criminal prosecution. -17- U.S. Drug Approval Process To obtain FDA approval of a product candidate, we must, among other things, submit clinical data providing substantial evidence of safety and efficacy of the product for its intended use, as well as detailed information on product composition, its manufacture and controls and proposed labeling. The testing and collection of data and the preparation of necessary applications are expensive and time-consuming. The FDA may not act quickly or favorably in reviewing these applications, and we may encounter significant difficulties or costs in our efforts to obtain FDA approvals that could delay or preclude us from marketing our products. The steps required before a drug may be approved for marketing in the U.S. generally include the following: • pre-clinical laboratory tests and animal toxicity testing; • submission of an IND for conducting human clinical testing to the FDA, which must become effective before human clinical trials commence; • adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug product for each indication, including controlled studies or comparison of treated group from clinical trials to data from natural history data or studies; • submission of a complete and compliant marketing application containing chemistry, manufacturing and control information for the drug substance and drug product, reports of nonclinical and clinical trials, product labeling and administrative information; • satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the commercial manufacturing facilities at which the drug substance and drug product are made to assess compliance with cGMP; • satisfactory FDA audit of the clinical trial site(s) that generated the pivotal safety and efficacy data included in the marketing application and also potentially the nonclinical trial site(s) in the form of pre-approval inspections; and • FDA review and approval of the marketing application. Pre-clinical trials may include laboratory evaluations of the product chemistry, pharmacology, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the pharmacokinetics, metabolism, bio-distribution, elimination and toxicity of the product candidate. The conduct of the pre-clinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with federal regulations and requirements. The results of the pre-clinical trials, manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed first in human clinical trial protocol are submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may be initiated. The IND will become effective approximately 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions about the supportive data, or the study design, particularly regarding potential safety issues with conducting the clinical trial as described in the protocol. In this situation, the trials are placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns before clinical trials can proceed. Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patient participants under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the study, the administration of the investigational product, study procedures, parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as a submission to the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”) requirements and federal and state laws and regulations protecting study subjects. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) at or servicing each institution in which the clinical trial will be conducted. The IRB will consider, among other things, rationale for conducting the trial, clinical trial design, participant informed consent, ethical factors, the safety and rights of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution. The FDA can temporarily or permanently halt a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial subjects. The IRB may also require the clinical trial at a particular site be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with GCP or the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions. -18- Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential drug development phases (Phases 1, 2 and 3) prior to approval, and a portion of these phases may overlap. A fourth post-approval phase (Phase 4) may include additional clinical trial s. A general description of clinical trials conducted in each phase of development is provided below. However, the number of study subjects involved in each phase of drug development for rare diseases can be significantly less than typically expected for more common diseases with larger patient populations: • Phase 1. Phase 1 clinical trials involve the initial introduction of the drug into human subjects. These studies are usually designed to determine the safety of single and multiple doses of the compound and determine any dose limiting toxicities or intolerance, as well as the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of the drug in humans. Phase 1 studies usually involve less than 100 subjects and are conducted in healthy adult volunteers, unless it is unethical to administer the study drug to healthy volunteers, in which case they are tested in patients. • Phase 2. Phase 2 clinical trials are usually conducted in a limited patient population to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the drug for a specific indication to determine optimal dosage and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks. Phase 2 studies usually involve patients with the disease under investigation and may vary in size from several dozen to several hundred. • Phase 3. If an investigational drug is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in early phase studies, larger Phase 3 clinical trials are conducted to confirm clinical efficacy, dosage and safety in the intended patient population, which may involve geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials which establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for a specific indication are required for approval of a marketing application. Phase 3 studies usually include several hundred to several thousand patients for larger, non-orphan drug indications/diseases. However, clinical trials for rare or orphan diseases generally have fewer patients due to their lower prevalence. For these orphan diseases, a company may also try to demonstrate efficacy and safety by comparing treated patients in clinical trials to untreated patients participating in placebo-controlled clinical trials or to observational natural history studies. • Phase 4. Phase 4 trials are clinical trials conducted after the FDA has approved a product for marketing. Typically there are two forms of Phase 4 trials: those that are conducted to fulfill mandatory conditions of product approval and those that are voluntarily conducted to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. The mandatory studies are used to confirm clinical benefit in the case of drugs approved under the accelerated approval regulations or to provide additional clinical safety or efficacy data for “full” approvals. Failure to promptly conduct and complete mandatory Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval for products approved under accelerated approval regulations. A company seeking marketing approval for a new drug in the U.S. must submit the results of the pre-clinical and clinical trials to the FDA in the form of a marketing application, together with, among other things, detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product candidate and proposed labeling, including payment of a user fee for FDA review of the application. The user fee is waived for an application for a product intended to treat an Orphan Indication. The FDA assesses all submitted marketing applications for completeness before it accepts them for filing. In some cases, the FDA may request additional information before accepting a marketing application for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the marketing application. Applications receive either standard or priority review. Under the current goals mandated under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (the “PDUFA”), the FDA has ten months in which to complete its initial review of a standard marketing application and respond to the applicant, and six months for a priority marketing application. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard or priority marketing applications. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the marketing application sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date. The FDA may refer an application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. Though the FDA is not bound by such recommendations, it considers them carefully when making decisions. If the FDA’s evaluations of the marketing application and the clinical and manufacturing procedures and facilities are favorable, the FDA may issue an approval letter. If the FDA finds deficiencies in the marketing application, it may issue a complete response letter, which defines the conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the marketing application. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will issue an approval letter, authorizing commercial marketing of the drug. Sponsors that receive a complete response letter may submit to the FDA information that represents a complete response to the issues identified by the FDA. Resubmissions by the marketing application sponsor in response to a complete response letter trigger new review periods of varying length (typically two to six months) based on the content of the resubmission. If the FDA’s evaluation of the marketing application and the commercial manufacturing procedures and facilities is not favorable, the FDA may not approve the marketing application. -19- A sponsor may also seek designation of its drug candidates under programs designed to accelerate the FDA’s review and potential approval of marketing application s. For instance, a sponsor may seek FDA designation of a drug candidate as a “fast track product.” Fast track products are those products intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. If fast track designation is obtained, the FDA may initiate early and frequent communication an d begin reviewing sections of a marketing application before the application is complete. This “rolling review” is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the remaining information. Eteplirsen was granted fast track status in 2007. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (“FDASIA”) enacted and signed into law in 2012 amended the criteria for the fast track and accelerated approval pathways and, as a result, the pathways now share many common eligibility criteria. FDASIA provides both the sponsor companies and the FDA with greater flexibility and expedited regulatory mechanisms. The statute clarifies that a fast track product may be approved pursuant to an accelerated approval (Subpart – H) or under the traditional approval process. In addition, FDASIA codified the accelerated approval pathway as separate and apart from the fast track pathway, meaning that for drugs to be eligible for accelerated approval, they do not need to be designated under the fast track pathway. FDASIA reinforces the FDA’s authority to grant accelerated approval of a drug that treats a serious condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies and demonstrates an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality (“IMM”) that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit (i.e., an intermediate clinical endpoint). Approvals of this kind typically include requirements for appropriate post-approval Phase 4 clinical trials to confirm clinical benefit. FDASIA retains this requirement and further requires those studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. Additionally, FDASIA established a new, expedited regulatory mechanism referred to as breakthrough therapy designation. Breakthrough therapy designation, fast track, and accelerated approval are not mutually exclusive and are meant to serve different purposes. The breakthrough therapy designation is focused on expediting the development and review process and by itself does not create an alternate ground for product approval. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of a drug candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the drug is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA issued guidance entitled “Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions––Drugs and Biologics” in May 2014. Finally, if a drug candidate demonstrates a significant benefit over existing therapy, it may be eligible for priority review, which means it will be reviewed within a six-month timeframe from the date a complete marketing application is accepted for filing. A Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (“RMAT”) designation is also designed to accelerate approval for regenerative advanced therapies such as our gene therapy product candidates, but the exact mechanisms have not yet been announced by FDA. We cannot be sure that any of our drug candidates will qualify for any of these expedited development, review and approval programs, or that, if a drug does qualify, that the product candidates will be approved, will be accepted as part of any such program or that the review time will be shorter than a standard review. Holders of an approved marketing application are required to: • report serious adverse drug reactions to the FDA; • submit annual and periodic reports summarizing product information and safety data; • comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling; • continue to have quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP after approval; and • conduct any post-marketing study designated as a required condition of the marketing application approval. The FDA periodically inspects the sponsor’s records related to safety reporting and/or manufacturing; this latter effort includes assessment of compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved marketing application, including withdrawal of the product from the market. -20- Foreign Regulatory Requirements We are pursuing regulatory approval of eteplirsen in jurisdictions outside of the U.S. In November 2016, we submitted a marketing authorization application (“MAA”) for eteplirsen to the EMA and the application was validated in December 2016. As we announced on June 1, 2018, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) within the EMA adopted a negative opinion for eteplirsen. In September 2018, the CHMP confirmed its negative opinion for eteplirsen, and the European Commission adopted the CHMP opinion in December 2018. During 2019, we sought follow-up EMA scientific advice for eteplirsen. Once data from our ongoing studies is available, we plan to evaluate future engagement with the EMA on potential next steps. We have initiated key activities in support of the potential launch of our products in the EU, such as building out commercial infrastructure and scaling-up manufacturing. As of the date of this Annual Report, EXONDYS 51 and VYONDYS 53 have only been approved for sale and marketing in the U.S. by the FDA, and EXONDYS 51 has been approved in addition for sale and marketing in Israel by the Israeli Ministry of Health. Thus, in addition to regulations in the U.S., our business is subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Irrespective of whether it concerns an FDA approved or investigational drug, the commencement of clinical trials and the subsequent marketing of a drug product in foreign countries are subject to preliminary approvals from the corresponding regulatory authorities of such countries. For example, the conduct of clinical trials in the EU is currently still governed by the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC laying down the principles and guidelines on GCP. Both Directives provide a system for the approval of clinical trials, which has been implemented through national legislation in the member states in the EU. Under this system, a sponsor must obtain approval from the competent national authority of an EU member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted, or in multiple member states if the clinical trial is to be conducted in a number of countries. Furthermore, the sponsor may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. The Clinical Trials Application (“CTA”) must include the supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC, corresponding national laws of the member states, and as further detailed in the applicable guidance documents. In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. Although the new Clinical Trials Regulation has been adopted and has entered into force in 2014, it will only come into application in the EU Member States six months after the European Commission has confirmed the functionality of the new Clinical Trials Information System (“CTIS”), which is the centralized EU portal and database for clinical trials introduced by the Regulation. The Regulation is currently expected to enter into application mid-2021. When the Regulation enters into application, it will repeal the currently applicable Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and its national implementation legislations. It will also apply to clinical trials that were authorized under the previous legislation if they are still ongoing three years after the Regulation has come into operation. No legislation needs to be adopted to implement the new Regulation into national law. The new Regulation provides an overhaul of the system, in order to harmonize the assessment of the submission and assessment of clinical trials conducted in EU Member States and to ensure greater consistency with the highest standards of patient safety in the EU. Specifically, the new legislation seeks to simplify and streamline approval of the clinical trials. Under the new coordinated procedure, the sponsor of a clinical trial is required to submit a single application to a reporting EU Member State. The reporting Member State will consult and coordinate with all other Member States in which the clinical trial is planned to be conducted. If the application is rejected, it can be amended and resubmitted through a central EU Portal. If an approval is issued, the sponsor can start the clinical trial in all Member States concerned. However, a Member State can in certain cases declare an “opt-out” from the approval. In such a case, the clinical trial cannot be conducted in such Member State(s). The Clinical Trials Regulation also aims to streamline and simplify the rules on safety reporting for clinical trials. In order to obtain marketing authorization for a medicinal product in the EU, applicants are required to submit a MAA to either (a) the national competent authorities (through the decentralized, mutual recognition, or national procedures) or (b) the EMA (through the centralized authorization procedure). Applicants are required to demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicinal product in the application for marketing authorization, which implies the requirement to conduct human clinical trials to generate the necessary clinical data. Furthermore, all applications for marketing authorization for new medicines have to include the results of studies as described in an agreed pediatric investigation plan (“PIP”). Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down the rules applicable to the centralized procedure for the authorization of medicinal products; The centralized procedure allows pharmaceutical companies to submit s a single application to EMA, which is followed by a single evaluation and which results in a single approval to market the medicinal product throughout the European Economic Area (the “EEA”), on the basis of a single market authorization. Approval via the centralized procedure is a two-step process whereby the CHMP first evaluates the MAA and issues an opinion on whether the medicinal product may be authorized or not (step 1). The CHMP opinion is subsequently sent to the European Commission (“EC”), which takes a legally binding decision to grant a marketing authorization (step 2). The marketing authorization is valid throughout the EU and is automatically recognized in three of the four European Free Trade Association states (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). This allows the marketing authorization holder to market the medicine and make it available throughout the EEA. The timeframe for the first step of the centralized procedure (evaluation by the CHMP) opinion is 210 days from receipt of a valid application. However, the actual time needed to complete this first step is generally longer than the 210 days, since procedural clock stops are required in order for the applicant to respond to additional requests for information by the CHMP. Following a positive CHMP opinion, the EC has 67 days to issue its decision to grant the marketing authorization or not. -21- Accelerated evaluation of the MAA is possible in exceptional cases, following a justified request from the applicant, when a medicinal product is of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The CHMP determines what constitutes a major public interest on a case-by-case basis. Justifications must include the major benefits expected and present the arguments to support the claim that the medicinal product introduces new methods of therapy or improves on existing methods, thereby addressing, to a significant extent, the greater unmet needs for maintaining and improving public health. In case of an accelerated assessment, the timeframe for review of a MAA by the EMA’s CHMP is reduced to 150 days. The timeframe for the EC to issue its decision remains unaltered. Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 defines in which cases the centralized application procedure must (mandatory scope) or may (optional scope) be followed. The centralized procedure is mandatory for medicinal products derived from biotechnological and other high-tech processes, orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy medicinal products and products indicated for the treatment of HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions, viral diseases and neurodegenerative diseases. For medicinal products that do not fall under any of the aforementioned categories, a submission via the centralized procedure is possible, provided that it concerns a new active substance or product that can demonstrate a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation and for which approval would be in the interest of public health. Given the foregoing, our portfolio of innovative orphan products for neurodegenerative diseases is subject to the mandatory centralized procedure. Innovative medicinal products which have been authorized in accordance with the centralized procedure, benefit from an eight-year period of data protection and a ten-year period of marketing protection. During the data exclusivity period, applicants for approval of generics of these innovative products cannot reference or rely upon data contained in the marketing authorization dossier submitted for the innovative medicinal product. Furthermore, the marketing protection entails that even if the generic product is approved, it cannot be placed on the market until the full ten-year period of market protection has elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference medicinal product. The marketing protection period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder for the innovative product obtains an authorization for new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies or as the result of significant pre-clinical or clinical trials. Pharmaceutical companies can apply for the designation as an orphan medicine. In the EU, applications for orphan designation are evaluated by the EMA. In order to qualify as an orphan medicine, the medicinal product must be intended to diagnose, prevent or treat condition that is life-threatening or chronically debilitating, with a prevalence of no more than 5 in 10,000 people in the EU or for which it is unlikely that its sale would generate sufficient returns to justify the investment needed for its development. In addition, the sponsor is required to demonstrate that no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition can be authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the medicinal product is of significant benefit to those affected by the condition as compared to approved methods. The benefits of being granted orphan designation are significant, including up to ten years of market exclusivity. During this ten-year period, the EMA may not accept a new marketing application for a similar medicinal product for the same therapeutic indication as the approved orphan medicinal product. Pursuant to Regulation (EC) 1901/2006 on medicinal products for pediatric use, the ten-year orphan market exclusivity can be extended to a maximum period of twelve years on the satisfactory completion of all the key elements of the agreed PIP. We have been granted orphan drug designation for eteplirsen in the EU. Similar to the U.S., marketing authorization holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA and/or the national competent authorities of the EU Member States. This oversight applies both before and after the granting of manufacturing and marketing authorizations. It includes compliance with EU GMP and GDP rules in relation to such activities as distribution, importing and exporting of medicinal products, rules governing conduct of pharmacovigilance and requirements governing advertising, promotion and sale of medicinal products. Failure to comply with the EU Member State laws implementing the EU Community Code on medicinal products, and EU rules governing the promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices, with the EU Member State laws that apply to the promotion of medicinal products, statutory health insurance, bribery and anti-corruption or with other applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the relevant EU Member State authorities. This may include any of the following sanctions: fines, imprisonment, orders forfeiting products or prohibiting or suspending their supply to the market, orders to suspend, vary, or withdraw the marketing authorization or requiring the manufacturer to issue public warnings, or to conduct a product recall. The approval process in other countries outside the U.S. and the EU varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for the FDA approval. In addition, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement for market access vary greatly from country to country. In all cases, clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. -22- Data and Market Exclusivities In addition to patent exclusivities, the FDA and certain other foreign health authorities may grant data or market exclusivity for a newly approved chemical entity or biologic, which runs in parallel to any patent protection. Regulatory data protection or exclusivity prevents a potential generic competitor from relying on clinical trial data generated by the sponsor when establishing the safety and efficacy of its competing product. Market exclusivity prohibits any marketing of the same drug for the same indication. In the U.S., the FDA will generally grant an NCE that is the subject of an NDA with five years of regulatory data exclusivity, during which time a competitor generally may not submit an application to the FDA based on a sponsor’s clinical data. A competitor, however, may file an Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”) seeking approval of a generic drug four years from the date of approval of the innovative product if it is accompanied by a so-called Paragraph IV certification. For a newly approved biologic that is the subject of a Biologics License Application (“ BLA”), the FDA will generally grant 12 years of market exclusivity, during which time a competitor may not market the same drug for the same indication. In addition, the FDA may provide six months of pediatric exclusivity to a sponsor of a marketing application, if the sponsor conducted a pediatric study or studies of a product. This process is applied to products developed for adult use and is initiated by the FDA as a written request for pediatric studies that applies to a sponsor’s product. If the sponsor conducts qualifying studies and the studies are accepted by the FDA, then an additional six months of pediatric exclusivity will be added to previously granted exclusivity, such as orphan drug exclusivity and NCE exclusivity, as well as certain patent-based exclusivities. Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity In the U.S., the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that drug. An orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. An orphan drug designation does not shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. The approval of an orphan designation request does not alter the regulatory requirements and process for obtaining marketing approval. Safety and efficacy of a compound must be established through adequate and well-controlled studies. If a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives FDA approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is generally entitled to an orphan drug exclusivity period of seven years, which means the FDA may not grant approval to any other application to market the same chemical entity for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as where an alternative product demonstrates clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. In addition, holders of exclusivity for orphan drugs are expected to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of their orphan drugs to meet the needs of patients. Failure to do so could result in the withdrawal of orphan exclusivity for the drug. Competitors may receive approval of different drugs or biologics for the indications for which a prior approved orphan drug has exclusivity. In Europe, the EMA may grant orphan status to product candidates thereby providing such product candidates with up to ten years of marketing exclusivity, meaning that another application for marketing authorization of a later, similar medicinal product for the same therapeutic indication will generally not be approved in Europe during that time period. Expanded / Early Access In certain countries, drug products approved in the U.S. or the EU can be accessed by patients before the drug has obtained marketing approval in such country. There are various forms of this access including, but not limited to, the actual purchase of product by the purchaser, which is often times the government for patients, on a named patient basis, and providing the product free of charge on a named patient basis for compassionate use. Each country has its own laws and regulations that apply to these forms of access and the extent and nature of such laws and regulations vary by country. For example, in 2018, the so-called Right to Try Act became law in the U.S. The law, among other things, allows eligible patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to such eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act. We have initiated an EAP for eteplirsen in select countries in Europe, North America, South America and Asia where it currently has not been approved. We are also in the process of initiating an EAP for golodirsen outside of the U.S. The EAP provides a mechanism through which physicians can prescribe our products, within their professional responsibility, to patients who meet pre-specified medical and other criteria and can secure funding. We have commenced shipments through the EAP and continue to expand the EAP to include more countries. In addition, we contracted with third party distributors and service providers to distribute our products in certain areas outside the U.S., such as Brazil and certain countries in the Middle East, on a named patient basis. -23- Other Regulatory Requirements In addition to regulations enforced by the FDA and foreign authorities relating to the clinical development and marketing of products, we are or may become subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and potential future foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations. Although we believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws that apply to us, we cannot predict whether new regulatory restrictions will be imposed by state or federal regulators and agencies or whether existing laws and regulations will adversely affect us in the future. Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws We are subject to various federal, state and local laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, including anti-kickback and false claims laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by crime or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, and/or exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). Federal and state authorities are paying increased attention to enforcement of these laws within the pharmaceutical industry, and private individuals have been active in alleging violations of the laws and bringing suits on behalf of the government under the federal False Claims Act (“FCA”). Violations of international fraud and abuse laws could result in similar penalties, including exclusion from participation in health programs outside the U.S. Given the broad scope of these laws, our activities could be subject to scrutiny under the laws. If we were subject to allegations concerning, or were convicted of violating, these laws, our business could be harmed. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute generally prohibits, among other things, a pharmaceutical manufacturer from directly or indirectly soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying any remuneration in cash or in kind where one purpose is either to induce the referral of an individual for, or the purchase or prescription of a particular drug that is payable by a federal health care program, including Medicare or Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or a specific intent to violate the statute. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute can result in exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs as well as civil and criminal fines and penalties of up to $102,522 per violation and three times the amount of the unlawful remuneration. A claim arising from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute also constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. A new federal anti-kickback statute enacted in 2018 prohibits certain payments related to referrals of patients to certain providers (such as clinical laboratories) and applies to services reimbursed by private health plans as well as government health care programs. Federal and state false claims laws generally prohibit anyone from knowingly and willfully, among other activities, presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for drugs or services that are false or fraudulent (which may include claims for services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary services). False or fraudulent claims for purposes of the FCA carry fines and civil penalties for violations ranging from $11,181 to $22,363 for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages sustained by the federal government and, may provide the basis for exclusion from federally funded healthcare programs. There is also a criminal FCA statute by which individuals or entities that submit false claims can face criminal penalties. In addition, under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General has the authority to exclude from participation in federal health care programs or to impose civil penalties against any person who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, certain false or otherwise improper claims. The majority of states also have anti-kickback, false claims, and similar fraud and abuse laws and although the specific provisions of these laws vary, their scope is generally broad, and there may not be regulations, guidance or court decisions that apply the laws to particular industry practices. Laws and regulations have also been enacted by the federal government and various states to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers. The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers; require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government; and/or require disclosure to the government and/or public of financial interactions (so-called “sunshine laws”). State laws may also require disclosure of pharmaceutical pricing information and marketing expenditures. Manufacturers must also submit information to the FDA on the identity and quantity of drug samples requested and distributed by a manufacturer during each year. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our activities could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent federal and state laws and regulations. Data Privacy and Security We may be subject to privacy and security laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate, obtain or store personally identifiable information. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business. -24- Within the U.S. , our operations may be affected by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations ( collectively, “ HIPAA ”) , which impose obligations on certain “covered entities” (healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) and certain of their “business associate” contractors with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Although we believe that we currently are neither a “covered entity” nor a “business associate” under the legislation, a business associate relationship may be imputed from facts and circumstances even in the absence of an actual business associate agreement. In addition, HIPAA may affect our interactions with customers who are covered entities or their business associates because HIPAA affects the ability of these entities to disclose patient health information to us. Various states also have laws that regulate the privacy and security of personal information and so may affect our business operations. For example, we are subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), that became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California consumers (defined to include all California residents) certain rights, including the right to ask companies to disclose information regarding the collection, use and disclosure of their personal information. The CCPA also imposes several obligations on companies to provide notice to California consumers regarding a company’s data processing activities. Additionally, the CCPA gives California consumers the right to ask companies to delete a consumer’s personal information and it places limitations on a company’s ability to sell personal information, including providing consumers a right to opt out of sales of their personal information. The compliance obligations imposed by the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) and the CCPA have required us to enhance our operations. The CCPA contains significant penalties for companies that violate its requirements and provides California residents a private right of action, including the ability to seek statutory damages, in the event of a data breach involving their data. Outside the U.S., other laws regulating the privacy and security of personal information may apply. For example, the processing of personal data in the EEA, is subject to the GDPR, which took effect in May 2018. The GDPR increases obligations with respect to clinical trials conducted in the EEA, such as in relation to the provision of fair processing notices, exercising data subject rights and reporting certain data breaches to regulators and affected individuals, as well as how we document our relationships with third parties that process GDPR-covered personal data on our behalf. The GDPR also increases the scrutiny applied to transfers of personal data from the EEA (including from clinical trial sites in the EEA) to countries that are considered by the European Commission to lack an adequate level of data protection, such as the U.S. Fines for non-compliance with the GDPR have the potential to be significant—the greater of EUR 20.0 million or 4% of our global annual revenue in the previous financial year. The GDPR imposes a private right of action on data subjects and their representatives for breaches of certain data protection requirements. Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement We have an ongoing dialogue with payors globally with the goal of obtaining broad coverage for our products. To date, payors’ policies on coverage for our products have varied widely, including policies that allow broad coverage per the respective product’s prescribing information, policies that provide limited coverage and policies that have denied coverage. The majority of payors have policies that provide for case-by-case coverage or restricted coverage. Our revenue depends, in part, upon the extent to which payors provide coverage for our products and the amount that payors, including government authorities or programs, private health insurers and other organizations, reimburse patients and healthcare providers for the cost of our products. Third Party Reimbursement and Pricing in the U.S. Commercial Insurance. Coverage and reimbursement of our products vary from commercial payor to commercial payor. Many commercial payors, such as managed care plans, manage access to FDA approved products, and may use drug formularies and medical policies (which may include specific coverage requirements such as prior authorization, re-authorization and achieving performance metrics under value-based contracts) to control utilization. Exclusion from or restriction in coverage can reduce product usage. Medicaid . Our products are eligible to be reimbursed by Medicaid. Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that is administered by the states for low income and disabled beneficiaries. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, participating manufacturers are required to pay a rebate for each unit of product reimbursed under the state Medicaid programs. The amount of the rebate for each product is set by law and may be subject to an additional discount if certain pricing increases more than inflation. State Medicaid programs and Medicaid managed care plans can seek additional “supplemental” rebates from manufacturers in connection with favorable positioning on formularies. Medicare . Medicare is a federal program that is administered by the federal government that covers individuals age 65 and over as well as those with certain disabilities. Our products are eligible for reimbursement under Medicare Part B. Medicare Part B generally covers drugs that must be administered by physicians. Medicare Part B pays for such drugs under a payment methodology based on the average sales price (“ASP”) of the drugs. Reimbursement levels and reimbursement methodologies have come under scrutiny and may be subject to change. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) are also increasingly bundling drug reimbursement into procedure costs, which can severely decrease the reimbursement rates for some manufacturers’ drugs. -25- Federal Purchasers . Drug products are subject to discounted pricing when purchased by federal agencies via the Federal Supply Schedule (“FSS”). FSS participation is required for a drug product to be covered and reimbursed by certain federal agencies and for coverage under Medicaid, Medicare Part B and the Public Health Service (“PHS”) 340B drug pricing program. FSS pricing is negotiated periodically with the Department of Veterans Affairs. FSS pricing is intended not to exceed the price that a manufacturer charges its most-favored non-federal customer for its product. In addition, prices for drugs purchased by the Veterans Administration, Department of Defense (including drugs purchased by military personnel and dependents through the TRICARE retail pharmacy program), Coast Guard, and PHS are subject to a cap on pricing (known as the “federal ceiling price”) and may be subject to an additional discount if pricing increases more than the rate of inflation. PHS 340B Drug Pricing Program . To maintain coverage of drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and Medicare Part B, manufacturers are required to extend discounts to certain purchasers under the PHS 340B drug pricing program. Purchasers eligible for discounts include hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of financially needy patients, community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the PHS. Healthcare and Other Reform. In the U.S., federal and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reform delivery of, or payment for, health care, which include initiatives to reduce the cost of healthcare. For example, in March 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (the “Healthcare Reform Act”), which expanded health care coverage through Medicaid expansion, implemented the “individual mandate” for health insurance coverage (by imposing a tax penalty on individuals who did not obtain insurance) and changed the coverage and reimbursement of drug products under government healthcare programs. Under the Trump administration, there have been ongoing efforts to modify or repeal all or certain provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act. Tax reform legislation was enacted at the end of 2017 that includes provisions that will affect healthcare insurance coverage and payment, such as the elimination of the tax penalty for individuals who do not maintain sufficient health insurance coverage. The Healthcare Reform Act has also been subject to judicial challenge. In December 2018, a federal district court judge, in a challenge brought by a number of state attorneys general, found the Healthcare Reform Act unconstitutional in its entirety because once Congress repealed the “individual mandate” provision, there was no longer a basis to rely on Congressional taxing authority to support enactment of the law. The court reasoned that the “individual mandate” was not severable from the rest of the Healthcare Reform Act and found the entire Healthcare Reform Act was an unconstitutional exercise of Congressional authority. In December 2019, a federal appeals court agreed that the individual mandate provision was unconstitutional, but remanded the case back to the district court to assess more carefully whether any provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act were severable and could survive. Pending action by the district court and resolution of any appeals, which could take some time, the Healthcare Reform Act is still operational in all respects. There have been other reform initiatives under the Trump Administration. For example, in May 2018, President Trump and the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services released a “blueprint” to lower prescription drug prices and out-of-pocket costs. Certain proposals in the blueprint, and related drug pricing measures proposed since the blueprint, could cause significant operational and reimbursement changes for the pharmaceutical industry. As another example, in October 2018, the CMS solicited public comments on potential changes to payment for certain Medicare Part B drugs, including reducing the Medicare payment amount for selected Medicare Part B drugs to more closely align with international drug prices. As another example, legislation passed in 2019 revised how certain prices reported by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated, a revision that the Congressional Budget Office has estimated will save the Medicaid program approximately $3.0 billion in the next ten years. There have also been efforts by government officials or legislators to implement measures to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products, including legislation on drug importation. Recently, there has been considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing and proposals to address the perceived high cost of pharmaceuticals. There have also been recent state legislative efforts to address drug costs, which generally have focused on increasing transparency around drug costs or limiting drug prices. Certain state legislation has been subject to legal challenges. Adoption of new legislation regulating drug pricing at the federal or state level could further affect demand for, or pricing of, our products. General legislative cost control measures may also affect reimbursement for our products. The Budget Control Act, as amended, resulted in the imposition of 2% reductions in Medicare (but not Medicaid) payments to providers in 2013 and will remain in effect through 2029 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Any significant spending reductions affecting Medicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented and/or any significant taxes or fees that may be imposed on us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. -26- Third Party Reimbursement and Pricing outside the U.S. We currently have no products approved for marketing outside the U.S., other than a marketing authorization for EXONDYS 51 in Israel. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. In the EU and certain other territories, price controls and Health Technology Assessments for new, highly priced medicines are expected. Uncertainty exists about the pricing and reimbursement status of newly approved products in the EU. Criteria such as cost-effectiveness, cost per quality-adjusted life year, budget impact, or others, in addition to the clinical benefit, are often required to demonstrate added value or benefit of a drug and vary by country. Third party reimbursement limits may reduce the demand for our products. The pace of the application process in some countries could also delay commercial product launches. Gaining acceptance of our product pipeline and an economically viable reimbursement terms in the EU and other markets will require strong education and awareness efforts around DMD as well as strong data supporting its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Competition The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive, and any product candidate developed by us would likely compete with existing drugs and therapies. There are many pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, public and private universities, government agencies and research organizations that compete with us in developing various approaches to the treatment of rare, neuromuscular and other diseases. Many of these organizations have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing and marketing resources than we have. Several of them have developed or are developing therapies that could be used for treatment of the same diseases that we are targeting. In addition, some of these competitors have significantly greater commercial infrastructures than we have. Our ability to compete successfully will depend largely on: • our ability to complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates; • the efficacy, safety and reliability of our product candidates; • the timing and scope of regulatory approvals; • product acceptance by physicians and other health-care providers; • protection of our proprietary rights and the level of generic competition; • the ability to have freedom to operate to commercialize our product candidates; • the speed at which we develop product candidates; • our ability to supply commercial quantities of a product to the market; • obtaining reimbursement for product use in approved indications; • our ability to recruit and retain skilled employees; and • the availability of substantial capital resources to fund development and commercialization activities, including the availability of funding from the U.S. government. DMD Program Competition . Currently, other than EXONDYS 51 and VYONDYS 53, no disease-modifying product has been approved for the treatment of DMD in the U.S. Other companies, however, have product candidates or other interests in development for the treatment of DMD. Wave Life Sciences (“Wave”) until recently was developing an exon 51 skipping product candidate for DMD, suvodirsen (WVE-210201). Wave also reported its intent to develop an exon 53 skipping product candidate, WVE-N531. On December 16, 2019, Wave announced the discontinuation of suvodirsen development for DMD (exon 51 amenable patients) and the suspension of further development of WVE-N531 for DMD (exon 53 amenable patients). Nippon Shinyaku Co. Ltd. (“Nippon”) has reported clinical data for its exon 53 skipping candidate, viltolarsen (NS-065/NCNP-01), from a Phase 1/2 study in Japan and a Phase 2 study in the U.S. Viltolarsen has been reported to have received an orphan drug designation in the U.S., was granted fast track designation by FDA and received a “SAKIGAKE designation” in Japan from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare (“MHLW”). Nippon reported in February 2019 that it had initiated a rolling NDA submission with the FDA. Nippon announced on February 7, 2020 that the FDA has filed its NDA for viltolarsen setting a target action date of the third calendar quarter of 2020. Nippon announced on September 26, 2019 that it submitted its NDA for viltolarsen in Japan to the MHLW. -27- Daiichi Sankyo (“Daiichi”) has reported a phase 1/2 clinical trial being underway in Japan for its exon 45 skipping candidate, DS-5141b. In April 2018, Daiichi announced top-line results of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial in Japan of DS-5141 and that Daiichi will continue to develop DS-5141b. Daiichi continues to sponsor an ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial of DS-5141b that is active and not recruiting. Solid Biosciences, LLC (“Solid”) has reported that its micro-dystrophin gene transfer product candidate for DMD, SGT-001 began a Phase 2 clinical study in December 2017. SGT-001 was granted fast track designation by the FDA in October 2018, orphan drug designation in August 2016, and rare pediatric disease designation in 2017. In Europe, orphan designation was granted in September 2016. In February 2019, Solid reported micro-dystrophin expression data for the first three patients in its clinical trial and announced plans to continue the study at a higher dose pending FDA and IRB approval. Solid announced on January 9, 2020 that in response to the FDA placing the SGT-001 IGNITE DMD trial on clinical hold, previously announced in November 2019, it is conducting its analyses of SGT-001 to determine how to address the clinical hold and resume dosing. Pfizer Inc. (“Pfizer”), following its acquisition of Bamboo Therapeutics, Inc., has initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial in January 2018 to test the safety and tolerability of its AAV-9 / micro-dystrophin gene transfer product candidate for DMD, PF-06939926/BMB-D001. The related orphan designation was granted in Europe in August 2016, and in the U.S. in May 2017. Rare pediatric disease designation was granted by the FDA in April 2018. In June 2019, Pfizer presented initial Phase 1b clinical data on PF-06939926, and on January 28, 2020, it announced that it expects proof-of-concept readouts for PF-06939926 in the first half of 2020. Other companies continue to pursue approval of products for the treatment of DMD and their products may or may not prove to be safer and/or more efficacious than the products and product candidates in our DMD pipeline. Regarding any of these competitors, it is unknown if further clinical development of these or other exon-skipping compounds is planned. Additionally, companies such as Santhera, PTC Therapeutics, Catabasis, Fibrogen, ReveraGen, Capricor, BioPhytis, Mallinckrodt, Astellas Pharma, and Tivorsan have product candidates with mechanisms of action distinct from ours in different stages of development or approval in DMD which we believe could be seen as complementary to exon skipping and not a direct replacement of our products or product candidates at this time. In addition, several companies and institutions have recently entered into collaborations or other agreements for the development of product candidates, including mRNA, gene (CRISPR, AAV, etc.) or small molecule therapies that are potential competitors for therapies being developed in the muscular dystrophy, neuromuscular, CNS and rare disease space, including but not limited to Audentes (now Astella), 4D Molecular Therapeutics, Biogen Inc., Ionis, Synthena AG, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Sanofi, Takeda, Roche, Novartis, Eli Lilly, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Moderna Therapeutics, Inc., Akashi, Oxford University, Exonics Therapeutics (acquired by Vertex Pharmaceuticals), CRISPR Therapeutics and Editas Medicine. Platform Technology Competition . We believe that other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies share a focus on RNA-targeted drug discovery and development. Competitors with respect to our RNA-targeted technologies include, but are not limited to, Alnylam, Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corp., Deciphera Pharmaceuticals, Ionis, BioMarin, Sanofi, Synthena AG, Roche Innovation Center Copenhagen (formerly Santaris Pharma A/S) , Shire plc (now Takeda), Nippon, Daiichi Sankyo, Moderna Therapeutics, Avidity, Dyne Therapeutics, Stoke Therapeutics and Wave. Employees As of December 31, 2019, we had 743 employees, 387 of whom hold advanced degrees. Of these employees, 397 are engaged directly in research and development activities and 346 are in selling, general and administration including 71 in the sales force. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we consider relations with our employees to be good. General Corporate Information We were originally incorporated in the State of Oregon on July 22, 1980, and on June 6, 2013, we reincorporated in the State of Delaware. Our principal executive offices are located at 215 First Street, Suite 415, Cambridge, MA 02142 and our telephone number is (617) 274-4000. Our common stock is quoted on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “SRPT”. While we achieve revenue from EXONDYS 51 and VYONDYS 53 in the U.S. and through distribution of eteplirsen on a named patient basis or through our EAP outside the U.S., we are likely to continue to incur operating losses in the near term associated with our ongoing operations, research and development activities and potential business development activities. For more information about our revenues and operating losses, see Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . -28- As of December 31, 2019 , we had approximately $ 1,134.4 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments, consisting of $ 835.1 million of cash and cash equivalents, $ 289.7 mil lion of short-term investments and $ 9.6 million of long-t erm restricted cash investment s . We believe that our balance of cash, cash equivalents and investments is sufficient to fund our current operational plan for at least the next twelve months. In addition to pursuing additional cash resources through public or private financings, we may also seek to enter into contracts, including collaborations or licensing agreements with respect to our technologies, with third parties, including government entities.

Set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC are descriptions of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report. Because of the following factors, as well as other variables affecting our operating results, past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also affect our results of operations and financial condition. Risks Related to Our Business We are highly dependent on the commercial success of our products in the U.S. We may not be able to meet expectations with respect to sales of our products or attain profitability and positive cash-flow from operations. On September 19, 2016 and December 12, 2019, the FDA granted accelerated approval for EXONDYS 51 and VYONDYS 53, respectively, as therapeutic treatments for DMD in patients who have a confirmed mutation in the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 51 and exon 53 skipping, respectively. EXONDYS 51 is currently commercially available in the U.S. and Israel only, and VYONDYS 53 is currently commercially available in the U.S. only, although they are available in additional countries through our EAP. The commercial success of our products continues to depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to: • the effectiveness of our sales, managed markets, marketing efforts and support for our products; • the generation and dissemination of new data analyses and the consistency of any new data with prior results, whether they support a favorable safety, efficacy and effectiveness profile of our products and any potential impact on our FDA accelerated approval status and/or FDA package insert for our products; • the effectiveness of our ongoing commercialization activities, including negotiating and entering into any additional commercial, supply and distribution contracts, ongoing manufacturing efforts and hiring any additional personnel as needed to support commercial efforts; • our ability to comply with FDA post-marketing requirements and commitments, including through successfully conducting additional studies that confirm clinical efficacy, effectiveness and safety of our products and acceptance of the same by the FDA and medical community since continued approval may be contingent upon verification of a clinical benefit in confirmatory trials; -29- • the occurrence of any side effects, adverse reactions or misuse, or any unfavorable publicity in these areas; • the generation of evidence describing payers, patients and/or societal value of our products; • whether we can consistently manufacture our products and product candidates at acceptable costs; • the rate and consistency with which our products are prescribed by physicians, which depends on physicians’ views on the safety, effectiveness and efficacy of our products; • our ability to secure and maintain adequate reimbursement for our products, including the duration of the prior-authorization as well as the number and duration of re-authorization processes required for patients who initially obtained coverage by third parties, including by government payors, managed care organizations and private health insurers; • our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products, to preserve our trade secrets, to prevent third parties from infringing on our proprietary rights and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties; • the development, commercialization or pricing of competing products or therapies for the treatment of DMD, or its symptoms, and the existence of competing clinical trials; • our ability to increase awareness of the importance of genetic testing and knowing/understanding DMD mutations, and identifying and addressing procedural barriers to obtaining therapy; • our ability to remain compliant with laws and regulations that apply to us and our commercial activities; • the actual market-size, ability to identify patients and the demographics of patients eligible for our products, which may be different than expected; • the sufficiency of our drug supply to meet commercial and clinical demands and standards, which are negatively impacted by various factors, including when our projections on the potential number of amenable patients and their average weight are inaccurate; if regulatory requirements increase our drug supply needs; if our current drug supply is destroyed or negatively impacted at our manufacturing sites, storage sites or in transit; failure to meet cGMP requirements; or if we encounter delays expanding the number of patients on our products and portions of our products’ supply expire before sale; • our ability to obtain regulatory approvals to commercialize our product candidates, and to commercialize our products in markets outside of the U.S.; • the process leading to a patient’s first infusion of our products may be slower for certain patients. For example, the time to first infusion may take longer if a patient chooses to put in an intravenous port, which eases access to the vein. Delays in the process prior to first infusion could negatively impact the sales of our products; and • the exercise by Roche of its option to obtain an exclusive license to commercialize one or more of our products outside of the U.S. and Roche’s subsequent commercialization efforts. We experience significant fluctuations in sales of our products from period to period and, ultimately, we may never generate sufficient revenues from our products to reach or maintain profitability or sustain our anticipated levels of operations. Even though EXONDYS 51 and VYONDYS 53 have received accelerated approval by the FDA, they face future post-approval development and regulatory requirements, which will present additional challenges we will need to successfully navigate. The accelerated approvals for EXONDYS 51 and VYONDYS 53 granted by the FDA were based on an increase in the surrogate biomarker of dystrophin in skeletal muscles observed in some patients treated with EXONDYS 51 and VYONDYS 53. These products will be subject to ongoing FDA requirements governing labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping, and we are required to submit additional safety, efficacy and other post-marketing information to the FDA. Under the accelerated approval pathway, continued approval may be contingent upon verification of a clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. These post-approval requirements and commitments may not be feasible and/or could impose significant burdens and costs on us; could negatively impact our development, manufacturing and supply of our products; and could negatively impact our financial results. Failure to meet post-approval commitments and requirements, including completion of enrollment and in particular, any failure to obtain positive safety and efficacy data from our ongoing and planned studies of our products, would lead to negative regulatory action from the FDA and/or withdrawal of regulatory approval of EXONDYS 51 or VYONDYS 53. -30- Manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP regulations. Drug product manufacturers are required to continuously monitor and report adverse events from clinical trials and commercial use of the product. If we or a regulatory agency discover previously unknown adverse events or events of unanticipated severity or frequency, a regulatory agency may require labeling changes , implementation of risk evaluation and mitigation strategy program, or additional post-marketing studies or clinical trials. If we or a regulatory agency discover previously unknown problems with a product, such as problems with a facility where the API or drug product is manufactured or tested, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product and/or the manufacturer, including removal of specific product lots from the market, withdrawal of the product from the market, or suspension of manufacturing. Sponsors of drugs approved under FDA accelerated approval provisions also are required to submit to the FDA, at least 30 days before initial use, all promotional materials intended for use after the first 120 days following marketing approval. If we or the manufacturing facilities for our products fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may: • issue warning letters or untitled letters; • seek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines; • suspend or withdraw or alter the conditions of our marketing approval; • mandate modifications to promotional materials or require us to provide corrective information to healthcare practitioners; • suspend any ongoing clinical trials; • require us to enter into a consent decree, which can include imposition of various fines, reimbursements for inspection costs, required due dates for specific actions and penalties for noncompliance; • refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to applications submitted by us; • suspend or impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; • seize or detain products, refuse to permit the import or export of products or require us to initiate a product recall; or • refuse to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. We are subject to uncertainty relating to reimbursement policies which, if not favorable, could hinder or prevent the commercial success of our products and/or product candidates. Our ability to successfully maintain and/or increase sales of our products in the U.S. depends in part on the coverage and reimbursement levels set by governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors. Third party payors are increasingly challenging the effectiveness of and prices charged for medical products and services. We may not be able to obtain or maintain adequate third-party coverage or reimbursement for our products, and/or we may be required to provide discounts or rebates on our products in order to obtain or maintain adequate coverage. We expect that private insurers will continue to consider the efficacy, effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and safety of our products, including any new data and analyses that we are able to collect and make available in a compliant manner, in determining whether to approve reimbursement for our products and at what levels. If there are considerable delays in the generation of new evidence or if any new data and information we collect is not favorable, third party insurers may make coverage decisions that negatively impact sales of our products. We continue to have discussions with payors, some of which may eventually deny coverage. We may not receive approval for reimbursement of our products from additional insurers on a satisfactory rate or basis, in which case our business would be materially adversely affected. In addition, obtaining these approvals can be a time consuming and expensive process. Our business would be materially adversely affected if we are not able to maintain favorable coverage decisions and/or fail to receive additional favorable coverage decisions from third party insurers, in particular during re-authorization processes for patients that have already initiated therapy. Our business could also be adversely affected if government health programs, private health insurers, including managed care organizations, or other reimbursement bodies or payors limit the indications for which our products will be reimbursed or fail to recognize accelerated approval and surrogate endpoints as clinically meaningful. In some foreign countries, particularly Canada and the countries of Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to strict governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take 12 to 24 months or longer after the receipt of regulatory approval and product launch. In order to obtain favorable reimbursement for the indications sought or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to collect additional data, including conducting additional studies. Furthermore, several European countries have implemented government measures to either freeze or reduce pricing of pharmaceutical products. If reimbursement for our products is unavailable in any country in which reimbursement is sought, limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be materially harmed. In addition, many foreign countries are referencing to other countries’ official public list price, hence an unsatisfactory price level in one country could consequently impinge negatively upon overall revenue. -31- We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of our current and future products due to a number of factors, including current and future healthcare reforms and initiatives by government health programs and private insurers (including managed care pl ans) to reduce healthcare costs, the scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing, the ongoing debates on reducing government spending and additional legislative proposals. These healthcare reform efforts or any future legislation or regulatory actions aimed at controlling and reducing healthcare costs, including through measures designed to limit reimbursement, restrict access or impose unfavorable pricing modifications on pharmaceutical products, could impact our and our partners’ ability to obtain or maintain reimbursement for our products at satisfactory levels, or at all, which could materially harm our business and financial results. Additionally, our gene therapy product candidates represent novel approaches to treatment that will call for new levels of innovation in both pricing, reimbursement, payment and drug access strategies. Current reimbursement models may not accommodate the unique factors of our gene therapy product candidates, including high up-front costs, lack of long-term efficacy and safety data and fees associated with complex administration, dosing and patient monitoring requirements. Hence, it may be necessary to restructure approaches to payment, pricing strategies and traditional payment models to support these therapies. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. If we are unable to obtain adequate levels of reimbursement, our ability to successfully market and sell our products and product candidates will be harmed. The manner and level at which reimbursement is provided for services related to our products and product candidates (e.g., for administration of our products to patients) is also important. Inadequate reimbursement for such services may lead to physician resistance and limit our ability to market or sell our products. Healthcare reform and other governmental and private payor initiatives may have an adverse effect upon, and could prevent commercial success of our products and product candidates. The U.S. government and individual states have aggressively pursued healthcare reform, as evidenced by the passing of the Healthcare Reform Act and the ongoing efforts to modify or repeal that legislation. The Healthcare Reform Act substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and contains a number of provisions that affect coverage and reimbursement of drug products and/or that could potentially reduce the demand for pharmaceutical products such as increasing drug rebates under state Medicaid programs for brand name prescription drugs and extending those rebates to Medicaid managed care and assessing a fee on manufacturers and importers of brand name prescription drugs reimbursed under certain government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Other aspects of healthcare reform, such as expanded government enforcement authority and heightened standards that could increase compliance-related costs, could also affect our business. Modifications have been implemented under the Trump Administration and additional modifications or repeal may occur. There are, and may continue to be, judicial challenges. We cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any changes to the Healthcare Reform Act or other federal and state reform efforts. There is no assurance that federal or state health care reform will not adversely affect our future business and financial results, and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative, judicial or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, waiver from Medicaid drug rebate law requirements, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs and the introduction of international reference pricing in the U.S. We anticipate that the U.S. Congress, state legislatures and the private sector will continue to consider and may adopt healthcare policies intended to curb rising healthcare costs. These cost containment measures may include implementation or modification of: • controls on government funded reimbursement for drugs; • caps or mandatory discounts under certain government sponsored programs; • controls on healthcare providers; • challenges to the pricing of drugs or limits or prohibitions on reimbursement for specific products through other means; • reform of drug importation laws; • delegation of decision making to state Medicaid agencies and waiver of reimbursement requirements; • expansion of use of managed care systems in which healthcare providers contract to provide comprehensive healthcare for a fixed cost per person; and • prohibition on direct-to-consumer advertising or drug marketing practices. We are unable to predict what additional legislation, regulations or policies, if any, relating to the healthcare industry or third party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future or what effect such legislation, regulations or policies would have on our business. Any cost containment measures, including those listed above, or other healthcare system reforms that are adopted, could significantly decrease the available coverage and the price we might establish for our products and product candidates, which would have an adverse effect on our net revenues and operating results. -32- Our products may not be widely adopted by patients, payors or healthcare providers, which would adversely impact our potential profitability and future business prospects. The commercial success of our products, particularly in the near term in the U.S., depends upon the level of market adoption by patients, payors and healthcare providers. If our products do not achieve an adequate level of market adoption for any reason, or if market adoption does not persist, our potential profitability and our future business prospects will be severely adversely impacted. The degree of market acceptance of our products depends on a number of factors, including: • our ability to demonstrate to the medical and payor community, including specialists who may purchase or prescribe our products, the clinical efficacy, effectiveness and safety of our products as the prescription products of choice for their respective indications; • the effectiveness of our sales and marketing organizations and distribution networks; • the ability of patients or providers to be adequately reimbursed for our products in a timely manner from government and private payors; • the ability to timely demonstrate to the satisfaction of payors real world effectiveness and the economic, humanistic and societal benefits of our products; • the actual and perceived efficacy and safety profile of our products, particularly if unanticipated adverse events related to our products’ treatment arise and create safety concerns among potential patients or prescribers or if new data and analyses we obtain for our products do not support, or are interpreted by some parties to not support, the efficacy of our products; and • the efficacy and safety of our other exon-skipping product candidates, including our exon 45 product candidate ( casimersen), and third parties’ competitive therapies. We may not be able to expand the global footprint of our products outside of the U.S. Even though EXONDYS 51 was approved for marketing in the U.S. and in Israel, and VYONDYS 53 was approved for marketing in the U.S., we may not receive approval to commercialize these products in additional countries. In November 2016, we submitted a MAA for eteplirsen to the EMA and the application was validated in December 2016. As we announced on June 1, 2018, the CHMP of the EMA adopted a negative opinion for eteplirsen. In September 2018, the CHMP of the EMA confirmed its negative opinion for eteplirsen, and the European Commission adopted the CHMP opinion in December 2018. During 2019, we sought follow-up EMA scientific advice for eteplirsen. Once data from our ongoing studies is available, we plan to evaluate future engagement with the EMA on potential next steps. In order to market any product in a country outside of the U.S., we must comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements for approval in those countries regarding demonstration of evidence of the product’s safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, labeling, distribution, advertising, and promotion, as well as pricing and reimbursement of the product. Obtaining marketing approval in a country outside of the U.S. is an extensive, lengthy, expensive and uncertain process, and the regulatory authority may reject an application or delay, limit or deny approval of any of our products for many reasons, including: • we may not be able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities outside the U.S. the risk benefit of our products; • the results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical or clinical significance required for approval by regulatory authorities outside the U.S.; • regulatory authorities outside the U.S. may disagree with the adequacy (number, design, size, controls, conduct or implementation) of our clinical trials prior to granting approval, and we may not be able to generate the required data on a timely basis, or at all; • regulatory authorities outside the U.S. may conclude that data we submit to them fail to demonstrate an appropriate level of safety or efficacy of our products, or that our products’ respective clinical benefits outweigh their safety risks; • regulatory authorities outside the U.S. may not accept data generated at our clinical trial sites or require us to generate additional data or information; • regulatory authorities outside the U.S. may impose limitations or restrictions on the approved labeling of our products, thus limiting intended users or providing an additional hurdle for market acceptance of the product; • regulatory authorities outside the U.S. may identify deficiencies in the manufacturing processes, or may require us to change our manufacturing process or specifications; and • regulatory authorities outside the U.S. may adopt new or revised approval policies and regulations. -33- Approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ significantly from that required to obtain approval in the U.S. In particular, in many foreign countries, it is required that a product receives pricing and reimbursement approval before the product can be distributed commercially. Many foreign countries undertak e cost-containment measures that could affect pricing or reimbursement of our products . This can result in substantial delays, and the price that is ultimately approved in some countries may be lower than the price for which we expect to offer our products . Marketing approval in one country does not ensure marketing approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining marketing approval in one country may have a negative effect on the approval process in others. Failure to obtain marketing approval in other countries or any delay or setback in obtaining such approval would impair our ability to develop foreign markets for our products and could adversely affect our business and financial condition. In addition, failure to obtain approval in one country or area may affect sales under the EAP in other countries or areas. Even if we are successful in obtaining regulatory approval of our products in additional countries, our revenue earning capacity will depend on commercial and medical infrastructure, pricing and reimbursement negotiations and decisions with third party payors, including government payors. In addition, we have granted Roche an exclusive option to obtain an exclusive license to commercialize certain products, including eteplirsen and golodirsen, outside of the U.S. If this option is exercised, Roche will have sole control over and decision-making authority with respect to the commercialization of such products outside the U.S. We cannot predict whether historical revenues from eteplirsen through our EAP outside the U.S. will continue or whether we will be able to continue to distribute eteplirsen through our EAP. We have initiated an EAP for eteplirsen in select countries in Europe, North America, South America and Asia where it currently has not been approved. We are also in the process of initiating an EAP for golodirsen outside of the U.S. While we generate revenue from the distribution of eteplirsen through our EAP, we cannot predict whether historical revenues from this program will continue, whether we will be able to continue to distribute our products through our EAP, or whether commercial revenues will exceed revenues historically generated from sales through our EAP. Reimbursement through national EAPs may cease to be available if authorization for an EAP expires or is terminated. For example, healthcare providers in EAP jurisdictions may not be convinced that their patients benefit from our products or may prefer to wait until such time as our products are approved by a regulatory authority in their country before prescribing any of our products. Even if a healthcare provider is interested in obtaining access to our products for its patient through the EAP, the patient will not be able to obtain access to our products if payment for the drug is not secured. Any failure to maintain revenues from sales of eteplirsen through our EAP and/or to generate revenues from commercial sales of eteplirsen exceeding historical sales through our EAP could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. If we are unable to successfully maintain and further develop internal commercialization capabilities, sales of our products may be negatively impacted. We have hired and trained a commercial team and put in the organizational infrastructure we believe we need to support the commercial success of our products in the U.S. Factors that may inhibit our efforts to maintain and further develop commercial capabilities include: • an inability to retain an adequate number of effective commercial personnel; • an inability to train sales personnel, who may have limited experience with our company or our products, to deliver a consistent message regarding our products and be effective in educating physicians on how to prescribe our products; • an inability to equip sales personnel with compliant and effective materials, including medical and sales literature to help them educate physicians and our healthcare providers regarding our products and their proper administration and educate payors on the safety, efficacy and effectiveness profile of our products to support favorable coverage decisions; and • unforeseen costs and expenses associated with maintaining and further developing an independent sales and marketing organization. If we are not successful in maintaining an effective commercial, sales and marketing infrastructure, we will encounter difficulty in achieving, maintaining or increasing projected sales of our products in the U.S., which would adversely affect our business and financial condition. -34- If we are unable to execute effectively our sales and marketing activities outside the U.S., we may be unable to generate sufficient product revenue. EXONDYS 51 and VYONDYS 53 are our first and second commercial products, respectively. As a result, our sales, marketing, managerial and other non-technical capabilities are relatively new in the U.S. We have built a commercial sales force in Europe and we are currently in the process of building commercial infrastructure in other key countries in order to be ready to launch our products with a relatively small specialty sales force in the event our products are ultimately approved in those jurisdictions. The establishment and development of our commercial infrastructure will continue to be expensive and time consuming, and we may not be able to successfully develop this capability in a timely manner or at all. We anticipate building sales, medical, marketing, managerial, distribution and other capabilities across multiple jurisdictions to prepare for potential approvals ex-U.S. Doing so will require a high degree of coordination and compliance with laws and regulations in such jurisdictions. If we are unable to effectively coordinate such activities or comply with such laws and regulations, our ability to commercialize our products in such jurisdictions will be adversely affected. Even if we are able to effectively hire a sales force and develop marketing and sales capabilities, our sales force may not be successful in commercializing our products or any product candidate that we develop. If we are unable to establish adequate manufacturing, sales, marketing, supply and distribution capabilities, whether independently or with third parties, we may not be able to generate product revenue and may not become profitable outside of the U.S. Furthermore, we have granted Roche an exclusive option to obtain an exclusive license to commercialize certain products, including eteplirsen and golodirsen, outside of the U.S. If this option is exercised, Roche will have sole control over and decision-making authority with respect to the commercialization of such products outside the U.S. If we fail to obtain or maintain regulatory exclusivity for our products, then we may not be able to protect our products from competition and our business may be adversely impacted. If a competitor obtains an authorization to market the same or substantially same product before a product of ours is authorized in a given country and is granted regulatory exclusivity, then our product may not be authorized for sale as a result of the competitor’s regulatory exclusivity and as a result, our investment in the development of that product may not be returned. In addition to any patent protection, we rely on various forms of regulatory exclusivity to protect our products. During the development of our products, we anticipate regulatory exclusivities available upon approval of our products. Implementation and enforcement of regulatory exclusivity, which may consist of regulatory data protection and market protection, varies widely from country to country. Failure to qualify for regulatory exclusivity, or failure to obtain or maintain the extent or duration of such protections that we expect in each of the markets for our products due to challenges, changes or interpretations in the law or otherwise, could affect our revenues for our products or our decision on whether to market our products in a particular country or countries or could otherwise have an adverse impact on our results of operations. We are not guaranteed to receive or maintain regulatory exclusivity for our current or future products, and if our products that are granted orphan status were to lose their status as orphan drugs or the data or marketing exclusivity provided for orphan drugs, our business and operations could be adversely affected. Due to the nature of our products and product candidate pipeline, in addition to new chemical entity exclusivity and new biologic exclusivity, orphan drug exclusivity is especially important for our products that are eligible for orphan drug designation. For eligible products, we plan to rely on orphan drug exclusivity to maintain a competitive position. If we do not have adequate patent protection for our products, then the relative importance of obtaining regulatory exclusivity is even greater. While orphan status for any of our products, if granted or maintained, would provide market exclusivity for the time periods specified above upon approval, we would not be able to exclude other companies from obtaining regulatory approval of products using the same or similar active ingredient for the same indication during or beyond the exclusivity period applicable to our product on the basis of orphan drug status (e.g., seven years in the U.S.). Orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug, nor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process. In addition, we may face risks with maintaining regulatory exclusivities for our products, and our protection may be circumvented, even if maintained. For instance, orphan drug exclusivity in the U.S. may be rescinded if (i) an alternative, competing product demonstrates clinical superiority to our product with orphan exclusivity; or (ii) we are unable to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of our orphan products to meet the needs of patients. Moreover, competitors may receive approval of different drugs or biologics for indications for which our prior approved orphan products have exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity in Europe may be modified for several reasons, including a significant change to the orphan medicinal product designations or status criteria after-market authorization of the orphan product ( e.g. , product profitability exceeds the criteria for orphan drug designation), problems with the production or supply of the orphan drug, or a competitor drug, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior than the initial orphan drug. Thus, we cannot guarantee that another company will not receive approval to market a product candidate that is granted orphan drug exclusivity for the same drug or similar drug and same orphan indication as any of our product candidates for which we plan to file an NDA, BLA or MAA. If that were to happen, our prior approved orphan products may face competition and any pending NDA, BLA or MAA for our product candidate for that indication may not be approved until the competing company’s period of exclusivity has expired in the U.S. or the EU, as applicable. For example, in January 2020, the FDA issued a draft guidance to clarify its position on when gene therapy products would be considered the “same” or “different” for purposes of orphan drug exclusivity. The draft guidance notes that if the gene therapy products differ in either the gene transferred by the products (“transgene”) or the vector used to deliver the transgene, then the two gene therapy products are different and could both be approved for same indication. If the transgene and the vector are the same, then the products are likely the “same,” such that the first product approved would gain regulatory exclusivity over the second product. If there are other, lesser differences in the products, FDA would make a case-by-case determination as how to apply orphan exclusivity to the competing product. As illustrated by this draft guidance, orphan drug exclusivity as applied to gene therapy products is an evolving area subject to change and interpretation by the FDA and therefore we cannot be certain as to how the FDA will apply those rules to our products. -35- Even though we have obtained orphan drug designation for certain of our product candidates and even if we obtain orphan drug designation for these or our future product candidates, due to the uncertainties associated with developing biopharmaceutical products, we may not be the first to obtain marketing approval for any particular orphan indication, which means that we may not obtain orphan drug exclusivity and could also potentially be blocked from approval of certain product candidates until the competitor’s orphan drug exclusivity period on its product expires (e.g., seven years in the U.S.) . Moreover, with respect to antisense oligonucleotides and gene therap ies , it is uncertain how similarity between product candidates designed to treat the same rare disease or condition may be determined on a country-by-country basis and whether the orphan drug exclusivity of a previously approved product can block the approval of a chemically distinct product candidate under regulatory review. The patient population suffering from DMD, LGMDs, Pompe disease, CMT 1A and MPS IIIA is small and has not been established with precision. If the actual number of patients is smaller than we estimate, our revenue and ability to achieve profitability may be adversely affected. DMD, LGMD, Pompe disease, CMT 1A and MPS IIIA are rare, fatal genetic disorders. DMD affects an estimated one in approximately every 3,500 to 5,000 males born worldwide, of which up to 13% are estimated to be amenable to exon 51 skipping and up to 8% are estimated to be amenable to exon 53. LGMDs as a class affect an estimated range of approximately one in every 14,500 to one in every 123,000 individuals. Pompe disease affects an estimated one in approximately every 40,000 individuals. CMT is a group of peripheral nerve disorders affecting approximately one in every 2,500 individuals. CMT type 1A affects approximately 50,000 patients in the U.S. MPS IIIA affects approximately 1 in 100,000 newborns. Our estimates of the size of these patient populations are based on limited number of published studies as well as internal analyses. Various factors may decrease the market size of our products and product candidates, including the severity of the disease, patient demographics and the response of patients’ immune systems to our products and product candidates. If the results of these studies or our analysis of them do not accurately reflect the relevant patient population, our assessment of the market may be inaccurate, making it difficult or impossible for us to meet our revenue goals, or to obtain and maintain profitability. We face intense competition and rapid technological change, which may result in other companies discovering, developing or commercializing competitive products. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and subject to significant and rapid technological change. We are aware of many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are actively engaged in research and development in areas in which our products and product candidates are aimed. Some of these competitors are developing or testing product candidates that now, or may in the future, compete directly with our products or product candidates. For example, we face competition in the field of DMD by third parties who are developing or who had once developed: (i) exon skipping product candidates, such as Wave Life Sciences (notably for exons 51 and 53), Nippon Shinyaku (notably for exon 53), Daiichi Sankyo (notably for exon 45) and Audentes Therapeutics, Inc. (notably for exons 2, 51 and 53); (ii) gene therapies that express microdystrophin or mini-dystrophin, such as Pfizer and Solid Biosciences; (iii) CRISPR/Cas 9 approaches, such as Exonics Therapeutics (acquired by Vertex Pharmaceuticals), CRISPR Therapeutics and Editas Medicine; (iv) other disease modifying approaches, such as PTC Therapeutics, which has a small molecule candidate, ataluren, that targets nonsense mutations; and (v) other approaches that may be palliative in nature or potentially complementary with our products and product candidates and that are being developed by Santhera, Catabasis, Fibrogen, ReveraGen, Capricor, BioPhytis, Mallinckrodt, Astellas Pharma, and Tivorsan . Although BioMarin announced on May 31, 2016 its intent to discontinue clinical and regulatory development of drisapersen as well as its other clinical stage candidates, BMN 044, BMN 045 and BMN 053, then-currently in Phase 2 studies for distinct forms of DMD, it further announced its intent to continue to explore the development of next generation oligonucleotides for the treatment of DMD. In addition, while Wave announced its intention to discontinue development of suvodirsen and suspend development of WVE-N531, continued development of one or both of these candidates is possible. In addition, we are aware of many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are actively engaged in research and development using platform technologies that may be viewed as competing with ours beyond and including those companies mentioned immediately above, such as Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corp., Deciphera Pharmaceuticals, Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Roche Innovation Center Copenhagen (formerly Santaris Pharma A/S), Shire plc (now Takeda), Biogen, Moderna Therapeutics, Avidity, Dyne Therapeutics, Stoke Therapeutics and Sanofi. Additionally, several companies and institutions have entered into collaborations or other agreements for the development of product candidates, including mRNA, gene therapy and gene editing (CRIPSR and AAV, among others) and small molecule therapies that are potential competitors for therapies being developed in the muscular dystrophy, neuromuscular and rare disease space, including, but not limited to, Astellas Pharma, Biogen Inc., Ionis, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Sanofi, Shire (now Takeda), Eli Lilly, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Moderna Therapeutics, Inc., Akashi, Catabasis, Capricor Therapeutics, Oxford University, Exonics Therapeutics (acquired by Vertex Pharmaceuticals), and Editas Medicine. If any of our competitors are successful in obtaining regulatory approval for any of their product candidates, it may limit our ability to enter into the market, gain market share or maintain market share in the DMD space or other diseases targeted by our platform technologies, products and product candidate pipeline. -36- It is possible that our competitors will succeed in developing technologies that limit the market size for our product s or product candidates, impact the regulatory approval and post-marketing process for our product s and product candidates , are more effective than our product s or product candidates or would render our technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. Our competitors may, among other things: • develop safer or more effective products; • implement more effective approaches to sales and marketing; • develop less costly products; • obtain regulatory approval more quickly; • have access to more manufacturing capacity; • develop products that are more convenient and easier to administer; • form more advantageous strategic alliances; or • establish superior intellectual property positions. We have entered into multiple collaborations, including our collaboration with Roche, and may seek or engage in future collaborations, strategic alliances, acquisitions or licensing agreements that complement or expand our business. We may not be able to complete such transactions, and such transactions, if executed, may increase our capital requirements, dilute our stockholders, cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities and subject us to other risks. In order to achieve our long-term business objectives, we actively evaluate various strategic transactions on an ongoing basis, including licensing or acquiring products, technologies or businesses. We may face competition from other companies in pursuing acquisitions and similar transactions in the biotechnology industry. This competition is most intense for approved drugs and late-stage drug candidates, which have the lowest risk and would have the most immediate effect on our financial performance. Our ability to complete transactions may also be limited by applicable antitrust and trade regulation laws and regulations in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions in which we or the operations or assets we seek to acquire carry on business. We have entered into multiple collaborations, including with Roche, Nationwide, Lysogene, Lacerta, Duke University, Genethon and StrideBio. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of such collaborations, and the anticipated benefits of any future collaborations or acquisitions, each of which involves numerous risks, including: • collaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to a collaboration; • collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our products or product candidates based on clinical trial results, changes in their strategic focus due to the acquisition of competitive products, availability of funding, or other external factors, such as a business combination that diverts resources or creates competing priorities; • collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial, stop a clinical trial, abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials, or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing; • collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or product candidates; • collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our intellectual property or proprietary information in a way that gives rise to actual or threatened litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential liability; • disputes may arise between us and a collaborator that cause the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our products or product candidates, or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources; • collaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product or product candidate; • failure to successfully develop the acquired or licensed drugs or technology or to achieve strategic objectives, including successfully developing and commercializing the drugs, drug candidates or technologies that we acquire or license; • entry into markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience or where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions; -37- • disruption of our ongoing business, distraction of our management and employees from other opportunities and challenges and retention of key employees; • potential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired company, or acquired or licensed product or technology, including but not limited to, problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges with respect to intellectual property, product quality, safety, accounting practices, employee, customer or third-party relations and other known and unknown liabilities; • liability for activities of the acquired company or licensor before the acquisition or license, including intellectual property infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities; • exposure to litigation or other claims in connection with, or inheritance of claims or litigation risk as a result of an acquisition or license, including but not limited to, claims from terminated employees, customers, former equity holders or other third-parties; • difficulty in integrating the products, product candidates, technologies, business operations and personnel of an acquired asset or company; and • difficulties in the integration of the acquired company’s departments, systems, including accounting, human resource and other administrative systems, technologies, books and records, and procedures, as well as in maintaining uniform standards, controls, including internal control over financial reporting required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related procedures and policies. For example, we will have limited influence and control over the development and commercialization activities of Roche in the territories in which it leads development and commercialization of SRP-9001, and if the exclusive option is exercised, in the territories in which it leads commercialization of certain other products or product candidates. Roche’s development and commercialization activities in the territories where it is the lead party may adversely impact our own efforts in the U.S. Failure by Roche to meet its obligations under the collaboration agreement, to apply sufficient efforts at developing and commercializing collaboration products, or to comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements, may materially adversely affect our business and our results of operations. In addition, to the extent we rely on Roche to commercialize any products for which we obtain regulatory approval, we may receive less revenues than if we commercialized these products ourselves, which could materially harm our prospects. Even if we achieve the long-term benefits associated with strategic transactions, our expenses and short-term costs may increase materially and adversely affect our liquidity and short-term net income (loss). Future licenses or acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, the creation of contingent liabilities, impairment expenses related to goodwill, and impairment or amortization expenses related to other intangible assets, which could harm our financial condition. For example, in February 2020, we issued and sold 2,522,227 shares of common stock to Roche Finance in connection with the entry into the collaboration agreement with Roche. Risks Related to the Development of our Product Candidates We may find it difficult to enroll patients in our clinical trials, which could delay or prevent clinical trials of our product candidates. Identifying and qualifying patients to participate in clinical trials of our product candidates is critical to our success. The timing of our clinical trials depends on the speed at which we can recruit eligible patients to participate in testing our product candidates. We have experienced delays in some of our clinical trials, and we may experience similar delays in the future. These delays could result in increased costs, delays in advancing our product development, delays in testing the effectiveness of our technology or termination of the clinical trials altogether. We may not be able to identify, recruit and enroll a sufficient number of patients, or those with required or desired characteristics to achieve diversity in a study, to complete our clinical trials in a timely manner. Patient enrollment is affected by factors including: • design of the study protocol; • size of the patient population; • eligibility criteria for the study in question; • manufacturing of product candidates; -38- • perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study, including as a result of adverse effects observed in similar or competing therapies; • proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients; • availability of competing therapies and clinical trials; • efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials; • patient referral practices of physicians; • activities of patient advocacy groups; • ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment; and • severity of the disease under investigation. In particular, each of the conditions for which we plan to evaluate our product candidates are rare genetic diseases with limited patient pools from which to draw for clinical trials. Further, because newborn screening for these diseases is not widely adopted, and it can be difficult to diagnose these diseases in the absence of a genetic screen, we may have difficulty finding patients who are eligible to participate in our studies. The eligibility criteria of our clinical trials will further limit the pool of available study participants. Additionally, the process of finding and diagnosing patients may prove costly. The treating physicians in our clinical trials may also use their medical discretion in advising patients enrolled in our clinical trials to withdraw from our studies to try alternative therapies. We may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials if we cannot enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in the clinical trials required by the FDA or the EMA or other regulatory agencies. Our ability to successfully initiate, enroll and complete a clinical trial in any foreign country is subject to numerous risks unique to conducting business in foreign countries, including: • difficulty in establishing or managing relationships with contract research organizations (“CROs”) and physicians; • different standards for the conduct of clinical trials; • our inability to locate qualified local consultants, physicians and partners; and • the potential burden of complying with a variety of foreign laws, medical standards and regulatory requirements, including the regulation of pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and treatment. If we have difficulty enrolling a sufficient number of patients to conduct our clinical trials as planned, we may need to delay, limit or terminate ongoing or planned clinical trials, any of which would have an adverse effect on our business. Failures or delays in the commencement or completion of ongoing and planned clinical trials of our product candidates negatively impact commercialization efforts; result in increased costs; and delay, prevent or limit our ability to gain regulatory approval of product candidates and to generate revenues and continue our business. Successful completion of clinical trials at each applicable stage of development is a prerequisite to submitting a marketing application to the regulatory agencies and, consequently, the ultimate approval and commercial marketing of any of our product candidates for the indications in which we develop them. We do not know whether any of our clinical trials will begin or be completed, and results announced, as planned or expected, if at all, as the commencement and completion of clinical trials and announcement of results is often delayed or prevented for a number of reasons, including, among others: • denial by the regulatory agencies of permission to proceed with our planned clinical trials or any other clinical trials we may initiate, or placement of a clinical trial on hold; • delays in filing or receiving approvals of additional INDs that may be required; • negative results from our ongoing non-clinical trials or clinical trials; • challenges in identifying, recruiting, enrolling and retaining patients to participate in clinical trials • timely and effectively contract with (under reasonable terms), manage and work with investigators, institutions, hospitals and the CROs involved in the clinical trial; -39- • negotiate contracts and other related documents with clinical trial parties and institutional review boards, such as informed consents, CRO agreements and site agreements, which can be subject to extensive negotiations that could cause significant delays in the clinical trial process, with terms possibly varying significantly among different trial sites and CROs and possibly subjecting the Company to various risks; • inadequate quantity or quality of supplies of a product candidate or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials, for example as a result of delays in defining and implementing the manufacturing process for materials used in pivotal trials or for the manufacture of larger quantities or other delays or issues arising in the manufacturing of sufficient supply of finished drug product; • difficulties obtaining institutional review board (“IRB”) approval, and equivalent approval for sites outside the U.S., to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site or sites; • ensure adherence to trial designs and protocols agreed upon and approved by regulatory authorities and applicable legal and regulatory guidelines; • delays or problems in analyzing data, or the need for additional analysis or data or the need to enroll additional patients; • the occurrence of serious adverse events or unexpected drug-related side effects experienced by patients in a clinical trial or unexpected results in ongoing non-clinical trials; • delays in validating endpoints utilized in a clinical trial; • our inability to satisfy the requirements of the regulatory agencies to commence clinical trials, including CMC requirements, or other regulatory requirements prior to the initiation of a clinical trial; • the regulatory agencies disagreeing with our clinical trial design and our interpretation of data from clinical trials, or changing the requirements for approval even after the regulatory authority has reviewed and commented on the design for our clinical trials; • reports from non-clinical or clinical testing of competing therapies that raise safety or efficacy concerns; and • the recruitment and retention of employees, consultants or contractors with the required level of expertise. Any inability to complete successfully pre-clinical and clinical development could result in additional costs to us or impair our ability to generate revenues from product sales, regulatory and commercialization milestones and royalties. In addition, manufacturing or formulation changes to our product candidates often require additional studies to demonstrate comparability of the modified product candidates to earlier versions. Clinical study delays also shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, which impairs our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and harms our business and results of operations. Results from pre-clinical and early‑stage clinical trials may not be indicative of efficacy in late‑stage clinical trials, and pre-clinical and clinical trials may fail to demonstrate acceptable levels of safety, efficacy, and quality of our product candidates, which could prevent or significantly delay their regulatory approval. To obtain the requisite regulatory approvals to market and sell any of our product candidates, we must demonstrate, through extensive pre-clinical and clinical trials, that the product candidate is safe and effective in humans. Ongoing and future pre-clinical and clinical trials of our product candidates may not show sufficient safety, efficacy or adequate quality to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals. For example, although we believe the pre-clinical data for PPMO SRP-5051 collected to date is positive, the additional data we collect, including in the clinic, may not be consistent with the pre-clinical data or show a safe benefit that warrants further development or pursuit of a regulatory approval for PPMO product candidates. Furthermore, success in pre-clinical and early clinical trials does not ensure that the subsequent trials will be successful, nor does it predict final results of a confirmatory trial. Some of our clinical trials were conducted with small patient populations and were not blinded or placebo-controlled, making it difficult to predict whether the favorable results that we observed in such trials will be repeated in larger and more advanced clinical trials. For example, on October 3, 2018, Nationwide presented positive results from a Phase 1/2a micro-dystrophin gene therapy clinical trial in four individuals with DMD enrolled in the trial and, on March 25, 2019, we presented nine-month functional and CK data from baseline from these four individuals, and twelve-month CK data from baseline from one of these individuals. In addition, on February 27, 2019, we announced positive expression and biomarker data from the first three-patient cohort dosed in the SRP-9003 gene therapy trial to treat LGMD type 2E, or beta-sarcoglycanopathy and, on October 4, 2019, we announced positive nine-month functional data from these three patients. The data is based on small patient samples and therefore may not be predictive of future results. In addition, we cannot assure that the results of additional data or data from any future trial will yield results that are consistent with the data presented, that we will be able to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of -40- these product candidates, that later trial results will support further development, or even if such later results are favorable, that we will be able to successfully complete the development of, obtain accelerated, conditional or standard regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize any of such product candidates. Similarly, we cannot provide assurances that data from our ongoing and planned studies with respect to our commercially approved products and product candidates will be positive and consistent or that the interpretation by regulators, such as the FDA or EMA, of the data we collect for our product s or product candidates will be consistent with our interpretations . Our product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of product candidates, limit the commercial potential or result in significant negative consequences following any potential marketing approval. Our product candidates may cause undesirable side effects. In addition to side effects caused by our product candidates, the administration process or related procedures also can cause adverse side effects. If any such adverse events occur in our trials, we may decide, or the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authorities could order us, to halt, delay or amend pre-clinical development or clinical development of our product candidates or we may be unable to receive regulatory approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. Even if we are able to demonstrate that all future serious adverse events are not product-related, such occurrences could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial. Moreover, if we elect, or are required, to delay, suspend or terminate any clinical trial of any of our product candidates, the commercial prospects of such product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate product revenues from any of these product candidates may be delayed or eliminated. Any of these occurrences may harm our ability to develop other product candidates and may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly. Our gene therapy product candidates may be perceived as unsafe or may result in unforeseen adverse events. Failure of other gene therapy programs, negative public opinion and increased regulatory scrutiny of gene therapy may damage public perception of the safety of our gene therapy product candidates and harm our ability to conduct our business or obtain regulatory approvals for our gene therapy product candidates. Gene therapy remains a newly applied technology, with only a few gene therapy products approved to date in the U.S., the EU or elsewhere. Public perception may be influenced by claims that gene therapy is unsafe, and gene therapy may not gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community. In particular, our success will depend upon physicians who specialize in the treatment of genetic diseases targeted by our product candidates, prescribing treatments that involve the use of our product candidates in lieu of, or in addition to, existing treatments with which they are familiar and for which greater clinical data may be available. In addition, ethical, social and legal concerns about gene therapy, genetic testing and genetic research could result in additional regulations or prohibiting the processes we may use. Federal and state agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments have expressed their intentions to further regulate biotechnology. More restrictive regulations or claims that our product candidates are unsafe or pose a hazard could prevent us from commercializing any products. New government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, regulations, policies or guidance changed, or interpretations by agencies or courts changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. More restrictive government regulations or negative public opinion would harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and may delay or impair the development and commercialization of our gene therapy product candidates or demand for any products we may develop. For example, earlier gene therapy trials led to several well-publicized adverse events, including death. Lack of efficacy and/or serious adverse events related to clinical trials we, our strategic partners or other companies conduct, even if such adverse events are not ultimately attributable to the relevant product candidates or products, and/or failed commercialization of gene therapy products may result in increased government regulation, unfavorable public perception, potential regulatory delays in the testing or approval of our product candidates, stricter labeling requirements for those product candidates that are approved and a decrease in demand for any such product candidates. If there are significant delays in obtaining or we are unable to obtain or maintain required regulatory approvals, we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates in a timely manner or at all, which could impair our ability to generate sufficient revenue and have a successful business. The research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, commercialization, marketing, selling and distribution of drug products are subject to extensive regulation by applicable local, regional and national regulatory authorities and regulations may differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In the U.S., approvals and oversight from federal (e.g., FDA), state and other regulatory authorities are required for these activities. Sale and marketing of our product candidates in the U.S. or other countries is not permitted until we obtain the required approvals from the applicable regulatory authorities. Of the large number of drugs in development in the biopharmaceutical industry, only a small percentage result in the submission of a marketing application to the FDA or an MAA to the EMA and even fewer are approved for commercialization. -41- Our ability to obtain the government or regulatory approvals required to commercialize any of our product candidates in any jurisdiction, including in the U.S. or the EU, cannot be assured, may be significantly delayed or may never be achieved for various reasons including the following: • Our non-clinical, clinical, chemistry, manufacturing and controls and other data and analyses from past, current and future studies for any of our product candidates may not be sufficient to meet regulatory requirements for marketing application approvals. The regulatory authorities could disagree with our interpretations and conclusions regarding data we provide in connection with NDA, BLA or MAA submissions for one or more of our product candidates, and may delay, reject or refuse to accept for review, or approve any submission we make or identify additional requirements for product approval to be submitted upon completion, if ever. In addition, in the U.S., an FDA advisory committee could determine that our data are insufficient to provide a positive recommendation for approval of any NDA or BLA we submit to the FDA. Even if we meet FDA requirements and an advisory committee votes to recommend approval of an NDA or BLA submission, the FDA could still disagree with the advisory committee’s recommendation and deny approval of a product candidate based on their review. • The regulatory approval process for product candidates targeting orphan diseases, such as DMD, that use new technologies and processes, such as antisense oligonucleotide therapies, gene therapy and other alternative approaches or endpoints for the determination of efficacy is uncertain due to, among other factors, evolving interpretations of a new therapeutic class, the broad discretion of regulatory authorities, lack of precedent, small safety databases, varying levels of applicable expertise of regulators or their advisory committees, scientific developments, changes in the competitor landscape, shifting political priorities and changes in applicable laws, rules or regulations and interpretations of the same. As a result of uncertainty in the approval process for products intended to treat serious rare diseases, we may not be able to anticipate, prepare for or satisfy requests or requirements from regulatory authorities, including completing and submitting planned NDAs, BLAs and MAAs for our product candidates, in a timely manner, or at all. Examples of such requests or requirements could include, but are not limited to, conducting additional or redesigned trials and procedures (e.g., additional safety data, patient muscle biopsies, dystrophin analyses and the use of assays), repeating or completing additional analysis of our data, or providing additional supportive data. In addition, in the U.S., an FDA advisory committee or regulators may disagree with our data analysis, interpretations and conclusions at any point in the approval process, which could negatively impact the approval of our NDA or BLA or result in a decision by the Company not to proceed with an NDA or BLA submission for a product candidate based on feedback from regulators. • We may not have the resources required to meet regulatory requirements and successfully navigate what is generally a lengthy, expensive and extensive approval process for commercialization of drug product candidates. Any failure on our part to respond to these requirements in a timely and satisfactory manner could significantly delay or negatively impact confirmatory study timelines and/or the development plans we have for PMO, PPMO, gene therapy-based product candidates or other product candidates. Responding to requests from regulators and meeting requirements for clinical trials, submissions and approvals may require substantial personnel, financial or other resources, which, as a small biopharmaceutical company, we may not be able to obtain in a timely manner or at all. In addition, our ability to respond to requests from regulatory authorities that involve our agents, third party vendors and associates may be complicated by our own limitations and those of the parties we work with. It may be difficult or impossible for us to conform to regulatory guidance or successfully execute our product development plans in response to regulatory guidance, including guidance related to clinical trial design with respect to any NDA, BLA or MAA submissions. Even if our product candidates demonstrate safety and efficacy in clinical studies, the regulatory agencies may not complete their review processes in a timely manner, or we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval. Additional delays may result if an FDA Advisory Committee or other regulatory advisory group or authority recommends non-approval or restrictions on approval. In addition, we may experience delays or rejections based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action, or changes in regulatory agency policy during the period of product development, clinical studies and the review process. Regulatory agencies also may approve a treatment candidate for fewer or more limited indications than requested or may grant approval subject to the performance of post-marketing studies. Finally, regulatory agencies may not approve the labeling claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our treatment candidates. Even after approval and commercialization of a product candidate, we remain subject to ongoing regulatory compliance and oversight to maintain our approval. Conducting our confirmatory studies could take years to complete, could yield negative or uninterpretable results or could result in an FDA determination that the studies do not provide the safety and efficacy requirements to maintain regulatory approval. If we or any of our strategic partners are unable to develop, or obtain regulatory approval for, or, if approved, maintain regulatory compliance and successfully commercialize, our product candidates, our business will be materially harmed. -42- We are investing significant resources in the development of novel gene therapy product candidates. Only a few gene therapy products have been approved in the U .S. and E U . I f we are unable to show the safety and efficacy of these product candidates , experience delays in doing so or are unable to successfully commercialize at least one of these drugs, our business would be materially harmed. We are investing significant resources in the development of our gene therapy product candidates. We believe that a significant portion of the long-term value attributed to our company by investors is based on the commercial potential of these product candidates. There can be no assurance that any development problems we experience in the future related to our gene therapy programs will not cause significant delays or unanticipated costs, or that such development problems can be solved. Initial results from ongoing clinical trials may differ materially from final results from such clinical trials. The results from pre-clinical and early clinical studies do not always accurately predict results in later, large-scale clinical trials. We may also experience delays in developing a sustainable, reproducible and commercial-scale manufacturing process or transferring that process to commercial partners, which may prevent us from completing our clinical trials or commercializing our products on a timely or profitable basis, if at all. In addition, the clinical trial requirements of the FDA, the EMA, and other regulatory agencies and the criteria these regulators use to determine the safety and efficacy of a product candidate vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use and market of the potential products. The regulatory approval process for novel product candidates such as ours can be more expensive and take longer than for other, better known or more extensively studied pharmaceutical or other product candidates. Currently, only a few gene therapy products have been approved in the Western world. Given the few precedents of approved gene therapy products, it is difficult to determine how long it will take or how much it will cost to obtain regulatory approvals for our gene therapy product candidates in the U.S., the EU or other jurisdictions. Approvals by the EMA and the European Commission may not be indicative of what the FDA may require for approval. Regulatory requirements governing gene therapy products have evolved and may continue to change in the future. Within the FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (“CBER”) regulates gene therapy products. Within the CBER, the review of gene therapy and related products is consolidated in the Office of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies, and the FDA has established the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER on its reviews. The CBER works closely with the National Institutes of Health (the “NIH”). The FDA and the NIH have published guidance documents with respect to the development and submission of gene therapy protocols. For example, on January 28, 2020, the FDA issued final guidance documents that updated draft guidance documents that were originally released in July 2018 to reflect recent advances in the field, and to set forth the framework for the development, review and approval of gene therapies. These final guidance documents pertain to the development of gene therapies for the treatment of specific disease categories, including rare diseases, and to manufacturing and long-term follow up issues relevant to gene therapy, among other topics. At the same time the FDA issued a new draft guidance document describing the FDA’s approach for determining whether two gene therapy products were the same or different for the purpose of assessing orphan drug exclusivity. In addition, the FDA can put an IND, on clinical hold if the information in an IND is not sufficient to assess the risks in pediatric patients. These regulatory review agencies, committees and advisory groups and the new requirements and guidelines they promulgate may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to perform additional or larger studies, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of these treatment candidates or lead to significant post-approval studies, limitations or restrictions. As we advance our product candidates, we will be required to consult with these regulatory and advisory groups and comply with applicable requirements and guidelines. If we fail to do so, we may be required to delay or discontinue development of our product candidates. If the anticipated or actual timing of marketing approvals for our gene therapy product candidates, or the market acceptance of these product candidates, if approved, including treatment reimbursement levels agreed to by third-party payors, do not meet the expectations of investors or public market analysts, the market price of our common stock would likely decline. Because we are developing product candidates for the treatment of certain diseases in which there is little clinical experience and we are using new endpoints or methodologies, there is increased risk that the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authorities may not consider the endpoints of our clinical trials to provide clinically meaningful results and that these results may be difficult to analyze. During the FDA review process, we will need to identify success criteria and endpoints such that the FDA will be able to determine the clinical efficacy and safety profile of our product candidates. As we are developing novel treatments for diseases in which there is little clinical experience with new endpoints and methodologies, such as gene therapy, there is heightened risk that the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory bodies may not consider the clinical trial endpoints to provide clinically meaningful results (reflecting a tangible benefit to patients). In addition, the resulting clinical data and results may be difficult to analyze. Even if the FDA does find our success criteria to be sufficiently validated and clinically meaningful, we may not achieve the pre-specified endpoints to a degree of statistical significance. Different methodologies, assumptions and applications we utilize to assess particular safety or efficacy parameters may yield different statistical results. Even if we believe the data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates are promising, these data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities. Pre-clinical and clinical data can be interpreted in different ways. Accordingly, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities could interpret these data in different ways from us or our partners, which could delay, limit or prevent full or accelerated regulatory approval. -43- If our study data do not consistently or sufficiently demonstrate the safety or efficacy of any of our product candidates, the regulatory approvals for such product candidates could be significantly delayed as we work to meet approval requirements, or, if we are not able to meet these requirements, such approvals could be withheld or withdrawn. Fast track product, breakthrough therapy, priority review, or Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (“RMAT”) designation by the FDA, or access to the PRIME scheme by the EMA, for our product candidates may not lead to faster development or regulatory review or approval process, and it does not increase the likelihood that our product candidates will receive marketing approval. We may seek fast track, breakthrough therapy designation, RMAT designation, PRIME scheme access or priority review designation for our product candidates if supported by the results of clinical trials. A fast track product designation is designed to facilitate the clinical development and expedite the review of drugs intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition which demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. A RMAT designation is designed to accelerate approval for regenerative advanced therapies such as our gene therapy product candidates. Priority review designation is intended to speed the FDA marketing application review timeframe for drugs that treat a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. PRIME is a scheme provided by the EMA to enhance support for the development of medicines that target an unmet medical need. For drugs and biologics that have been designated as fast track products or breakthrough therapies, or granted access to the PRIME schema, interaction and communication between the regulatory agency and the sponsor of the trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development. Sponsors of drugs with fast track products or breakthrough therapies may also be able to submit marketing applications on a rolling basis, meaning that the FDA may review portions of a marketing application before the sponsor submits the complete application to the FDA, if the sponsor pays the user fee upon submission of the first portion of the marketing application. For products that receive a priority review designation, the FDA's marketing application review goal is shortened to six months, as opposed to ten months under standard review. This review goal is based on the date the FDA accepts the marketing application for review, this application validation period typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. RMAT designations will accelerate approval but the exact mechanisms have not yet been announced by FDA. Designation as a fast track product, breakthrough therapy, RMAT, PRIME, or priority review product is within the discretion of the regulatory agency. Accordingly, even if we believe one of our product candidates meets the criteria for designation as a fast track product, breakthrough therapy, RMAT, PRIME, or priority review product, the agency may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation. In any event, the receipt of such a designation for a product candidate may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional regulatory procedures and does not assure ultimate marketing approval by the agency. In addition, regarding fast track products and breakthrough therapies, the FDA may later decide that the products no longer meet the conditions for qualification as either a fast track product, RMAT, or a breakthrough therapy or, for priority review products, decide that period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. We may not be able to advance all of our programs, and we may use our financial and human resources to pursue particular programs and fail to capitalize on programs that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success. Our pipeline includes more than 40 programs in various stages of development for a broad range of diseases and disorders. We plan to expand our pipeline through internal research and development and through strategic transactions. Because we have limited resources, we may not be able to advance all of our programs. We may also forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with certain programs or for indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs for product candidates may not yield any commercially viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through strategic collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate, or we may allocate internal resources to a product candidate in a therapeutic area in which it would have been more advantageous to enter into a partnering arrangement. -44- Risks Related to Third Parties If we are unable to maintain our agreements with third parties to distribute our products to patients, our results of operations and business could be adversely affected. We rely on third parties to commercially distribute our products to patients in the U.S. We have contracted with a third-party logistics company to warehouse our products and with distributors and specialty pharmacies to sell and distribute our products to patients. A specialty pharmacy is a pharmacy that specializes in the dispensing of medications for complex or chronic conditions that require a high level of patient education and ongoing management. This distribution network requires significant coordination with our sales and marketing and finance organizations. In addition, failure to coordinate financial systems could negatively impact our ability to accurately report product revenue from our products. If we are unable to effectively manage the distribution process, the sales of our products, as well as any future products we may commercialize, could be delayed or severely compromised and our results of operations may be harmed. In addition, the use of third parties involves certain risks, including, but not limited to, risks that these organizations will: • not provide us with accurate or timely information regarding their inventories, the number of patients who are using our products or serious adverse events and/or product complaints regarding our products; • not effectively sell or support our products; • reduce or discontinue their efforts to sell or support our products; • not devote the resources necessary to sell our products in the volumes and within the time frame we expect; • be unable to satisfy financial obligations to us or others; or • cease operations. Any such events may result in decreased product sales, lower product revenue, loss of revenue, and/or reputational damage, which would harm our results of operations and business. With respect to the pre-commercial distribution of our products to patients outside of the U.S., we have contracted with third party distributors and service providers to distribute our products in certain countries through our EAP. We will need to continue building out our network for commercial distribution in jurisdictions in which our products are approved, which will also require third party contracts. The use of distributors and service providers involves certain risks, including, but not limited to, risks that these organizations will not comply with applicable laws and regulations, or not provide us with accurate or timely information regarding serious adverse events and/or product complaints regarding our products. Any such events may result in regulatory actions that may include suspension or termination of the distribution and sale of our products in a certain country, loss of revenue, and/or reputational damage, which could harm our results of operations and business. We rely on third parties to conduct some aspects of our early stage research and pre-clinical and clinical development. The inadequate performance by or loss of any of these third parties could affect the development and commercialization of our product candidate development. We have relied upon, and plan to continue to rely upon, third parties to conduct some aspects of our early stage research and pre-clinical and clinical development with respect to certain of our product candidates, including our follow-on exon-skipping product candidates, PPMO, gene therapy and gene editing product candidates. Our third-party collaborators may not commit sufficient resources or adequately develop our programs for these candidates. If our third-party collaborators fail to commit sufficient resources to any of our product candidates or to carry out their contractual duties or obligations, our programs related to any particular product candidate could be delayed, terminated, or unsuccessful. Furthermore, if we fail to make required payments to these third-party collaborators, including up-front, milestone, reimbursement or royalty payments, or to observe other obligations in our agreements with them, these third parties may not be required to perform their obligations under our respective agreements with them and may have the right to terminate such agreements. We also have relied upon and plan to continue to rely upon third-party CROs to monitor and manage data for our ongoing pre-clinical and clinical programs. We rely on these parties for execution of our pre-clinical and clinical trials, and we control only certain aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol and legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on collaborators and CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. -45- The individuals at our third-party collaborators and CROs who conduct work on our behalf, including their sub-contractors, are not always our employees, and although we participate in the planning of our early stage research and pre-clinical and clinical programs, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources or exercise appropriate oversight of these programs, except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such third parties. If our collaborators and CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our pre-clinical and clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates. As a result, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed. Our reliance on third parties requires us to share our proprietary information, which increases the possibility that a competitor will discover them or that our proprietary information will be misappropriated or inadvertently disclosed. Our reliance on third-party collaborators requires us to disclose our proprietary information to these parties, which could increase the risk that a competitor will discover this information or that this information will be misappropriated or disclosed without our intent to do so. Furthermore, if these third parties cease to continue operations and we are not able to quickly find a replacement provider or we lose information or items associated with our products or product candidates, our development programs may be delayed. Although we carefully manage our relationships with our third-party collaborators and CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects. Risks Related to Manufacturing We currently rely on third parties to manufacture our products and to produce our product candidates; our dependence on these parties, including failure on our part to accurately anticipate product demand and timely secure manufacturing capacity to meet commercial, EAP, clinical and pre-clinical product demand may impair the availability of product to successfully support various programs, including research and development and the potential commercialization of our product candidates. We currently do not have the internal ability to undertake the manufacturing process for our products or product candidates in the quantities needed to meet commercial, clinical or EAPs demand for our products, or to conduct our research and development programs and conduct clinical trials. Therefore, we rely on, and expect to continue relying on for the foreseeable future, a limited number of third parties to manufacture and supply materials (including raw materials and subunits), API and drug product, as well as to perform additional steps in the manufacturing process, such as labeling and packaging of vials and storage of our products and product candidates. The limited number of third parties with facilities and capabilities suited for the manufacturing process of our products and product candidates creates a heightened risk that we may not be able to obtain materials and APIs in the quantity and purity that we require. In addition, the process for adding new manufacturing capacity is lengthy and often causes delays in development efforts. Any interruption of the development or operation of those facilities due to, among other reasons, events such as order delays for equipment or materials, equipment malfunctions, quality control and quality assurance issues, regulatory delays and possible negative effects of such delays on supply chains and expected timelines for product availability, production yield issues, shortages of qualified personnel, discontinuation of a facility or business or failure or damage to a facility by natural disasters, such as earthquakes or fires, could result in the cancellation of shipments, loss of product in the manufacturing process or a shortfall in supply of our products, product candidates or materials. If these third parties cease providing quality manufacturing and related services to us, and we are not able to engage appropriate replacements in a timely manner, our ability to manufacture our products or product candidates in sufficient quality and quantity required for our planned commercial, pre-clinical and clinical or EAPs, our various product research, development and commercialization efforts would be adversely affected. Furthermore, a ny problems in our manufacturing process or the facilities with which we contract make us a less attractive collaborator for potential partners, including larger pharmaceutical companies and academic research institutions, which could limit our access to additional attractive development programs. Problems in third-party manufacturing processes or facilities also restrict our ability to meet market demand. -46- We, throu gh our third- party manufacturers, seek to produce or produce supply of our products and product candidates. In light of the limited number of third parties with the expertise to produce our products and product candidates, the lead time needed to manufacture them, and the availability of underlying materials, we may not be able to, in a timely manner or at all, establish or maintain sufficient commercial and other manufacturing arrangements on the commercially reasonable terms necessary to provide adequate supply of our products and product candidates. Furthermore, we may not be able to obtain the significant financial capital that may be required in connection with such arrangements. Even after successfully engaging third parties to execute the manufacturing process for our products and product candidates, such parties may not comply with the terms and timelines they have agreed to for various reasons, some of which may be out of their or our control, which impact s our ability to execute our business plans on expected or required timelines in connection with the commercialization of our products and the continued development of our product candidates. W hen w e enter into long-term manufacturing agreements that contain exclusivity provisions and /or substantial termination penalties, we constrain our operational flexibility . The third parties we use in the manufacturing process for our products and product candidates may fail to comply with cGMP regulations. Our contract manufacturers are required to produce our materials, APIs and drug products under cGMP. We and our contract manufacturers are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA, EMA and corresponding state and foreign authorities to ensure strict compliance with cGMP and other applicable government regulations. In addition, before we can begin to commercially manufacture our product candidates in third-party or our own facilities, we must obtain regulatory approval from the FDA, which includes a review of the manufacturing process and facility. A manufacturing authorization also must be obtained from the appropriate EU regulatory authorities and may be required by other foreign regulatory authorities. The timeframe required to obtain such approval or authorization is uncertain. In order to obtain approval, we need to demonstrate that all of our processes, methods and equipment are compliant with cGMP, and perform extensive audits of vendors, contract laboratories and suppliers. In complying with cGMP, we are obligated to expend time, money and effort in production, record keeping and quality control to seek to assure that the product meets applicable specifications and other requirements. We do not have direct operational control over a third-party manufacturer’s compliance with regulations and requirements. In addition, changes in cGMP could negatively impact the ability of our contract manufacturers to complete the manufacturing process of our products and product candidates in a compliant manner on the schedule we require for commercial and clinical trial use, respectively. Failure to achieve and maintain compliance with cGMP and other applicable government regulations, including failure to detect or control anticipated or unanticipated manufacturing errors, results in product recalls, clinical holds, delayed or withheld approvals, patient injury or death. This risk is particularly heightened as we optimize manufacturing for our product candidates. For example, we were notified by the Research Institute at Nationwide that they received a letter from the FDA on July 24, 2018, stating that their Phase 1/2a DMD micro-dystrophin gene therapy trial had been placed on clinical hold due to the presence of a trace amount of DNA fragment in research-grade third-party supplied plasmid (the “Clinical Hold”). The Research Institute, working with us, developed an action plan with immediate plans to submit for review by the FDA, which included the use of cGMP plasmid for the program. On September 24, 2018, we announced that the FDA had lifted the Clinical Hold. Failure by our contract manufacturers to adhere to applicable cGMP and other applicable government regulations, or our contract manufacturers experiencing manufacturing problems, may result in significant negative consequences, including product seizures or recalls, postponement or cancellation of clinical trials, loss or delay of product approval, fines and sanctions, loss of revenue, termination of the development of a product candidate, reputational damage, shipment delays, inventory shortages, inventory write-offs and other product-related charges and increased manufacturing costs. If we experience any of these consequences, the success of our commercialization of our products and/or our development efforts for our product candidates could be significantly delayed, fail or otherwise be negatively impacted. We may not be able to successfully scale up manufacturing of our products or product candidates in sufficient quality and quantity or within targeted timelines, or be able to secure ownership of intellectual property rights developed in this process, which could negatively impact the commercial success of our products and/or the development of our product candidates. We are working to increase manufacturing capacity and scale up production of some of the components of our drug products. Our focus remains on (i) achieving larger-scale manufacturing capacity for our products and product candidates throughout the manufacturing supply chain, (ii) continuing to increase material and API production capacity to provide the anticipated amounts of drug product needed for our planned studies for our product candidates and (iii) optimizing manufacturing for our follow-on exon skipping product candidates and other programs, including PPMO and gene therapy. We may not be able to successfully increase manufacturing capacity or scale up the production of materials, APIs and drug products, whether in collaboration with third party manufacturers or on our own, in a manner that is safe, compliant with cGMP conditions or other applicable legal or regulatory requirements, in a cost-effective manner, in a time frame required to meet our timeline for commercialization, clinical trials and other business plans, or at all. -47- Challenges complying with cGMP requirements and other quality issues arise during efforts to increase manufacturing capacity and scale up production. We experience such issues in connection with manufacturing, packaging and storage of our products and product candidate s , and during shipping and storage of the APIs or finished drug product. In addition, in order to release our products for commercial use and demonstrate stability of product candidates for use in clinical trials (and any subsequent drug products for commercial use), our manufacturing processes and analytical methods must be validated in accordance with regulatory guidelines. Failure to successfully validate, or maintain validation of, our manufacturing processes and analytical methods or demonstrate adequate purity, stability or comparability of our products or product candidates in a timely or cost-effective manner, or at all , may undermine our commercial efforts . Failure to successfully validate our manufacturing processes and analytical methods or to demonstrate adequate purity, stability or comparability, will negatively impact the commercial availability of our products and the continued development and/or regulatory approval of our product candidates, which could significantly harm our business. During our work with our third-party manufacturers to increase and optimize manufacturing capacity and scale up production, they may make proprietary improvements in the manufacturing and scale-up processes for our products or product candidates. We may not own or be able to secure ownership of such improvements or may have to share the intellectual property rights to those improvements. Additionally, we may need additional processes, technologies and validation studies, which could be costly and which we may not be able to develop or acquire from third parties. Failure to secure the intellectual property rights required for the manufacturing process needed for large-scale clinical trials or commercialization of our products or the continued development of our product candidates could cause significant delays in our business plans or otherwise negatively impact the commercialization of our products or the continued development of our product candidates. Products intended for use in gene therapies are novel, complex and difficult to manufacture. We could experience production problems that result in delays in our development or commercialization of gene therapy programs, limit the supply of our products or otherwise harm our business. We currently have development, manufacturing and testing agreements with third parties to manufacture supplies of our gene therapy product candidates. Several factors could cause production interruptions, including equipment malfunctions, facility contamination, raw material shortages or contamination, natural disasters, disruption in utility services, human error or disruptions in the operations of suppliers. The physical and chemical properties of biologics such as ours generally cannot be fully characterized. As a result, assays of the finished product may not be sufficient to ensure that the product will perform in the intended manner. Accordingly, we employ multiple steps to control our manufacturing process to assure that the process works and the product candidate is made strictly and consistently in compliance with the process. Problems with the manufacturing process, even minor deviations from the normal process, could result in product defects or manufacturing failures that result in lot failures, product recalls, product liability claims or insufficient inventory. We may encounter problems achieving adequate quantities and quality of clinical and/or commercial-grade materials that meet FDA, EMA or other applicable foreign standards or specifications with consistent and acceptable production yields and costs. In addition, the FDA, the EMA and other foreign regulatory authorities may require us to submit samples of any lot of any approved product together with the protocols showing the results of applicable tests at any time. Under some circumstances, the FDA, the EMA or other foreign regulatory authorities may require that we not distribute a lot until the competent authority authorizes its release. Slight deviations in the manufacturing process, including those affecting quality attributes and stability and deviations among different sites, may result in unacceptable changes in the product that could result in lot failures or product recalls. Lot failures or product recalls could cause us to delay clinical trials or product launches which could be costly to us and otherwise harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. As our product candidates advance to later stage clinical trials, it is customary that various aspects of the development program, such as manufacturing, formulation and other processes, and methods of administration, may be altered to optimize the candidates and processes for scale-up necessary for later stage clinical trials and potential approval and commercialization. These changes may not produce the intended optimization, including production of drug substance and drug product of a quality and in a quantity sufficient for Phase 3 clinical stage development or for commercialization, which may cause delays in the initiation or completion of clinical trials and greater costs. We may also need to conduct additional studies to demonstrate comparability between newly manufactured drug substance and/or drug product for commercialization relative to previously manufactured drug substance and/or drug product for clinical trials. Demonstrating comparability may require us to incur additional costs or delay initiation or completion of clinical trials and, if unsuccessful, could require us to complete additional preclinical studies or clinical trials. We also may encounter problems hiring and retaining the experienced scientific, quality control and manufacturing personnel needed to operate our manufacturing process which could result in delays in our production or difficulties in maintaining compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. -48- Furthermore, n o manufacturer currently has the experience or ability to produce our vectors or gene therapy product candidates at commercial levels. Even if we timely develop a manufacturing process and successfully transfer it to the third-party vector and product manufacturers or successfully and timely develop our internal capacity, if we or such third-party manufacturers are unable to produce the necessary quantities of viral vectors and our product candidates, or in compliance with GMP or other pertinent regulatory requirements, and within our planned time frame and cost parameters, it may result in delays in our development plans or increased capital expenditures , and the development and sales of our products, if approved, may be materially harmed. Risks Related to our Intellectual Property Our success, competitive position and future revenue depend in part on our ability and the abilities of our licensors and other collaborators to obtain, maintain and defend the patent protection for our products, product candidates, and platform technologies, to preserve our trade secrets, and to prevent third parties from infringing on our proprietary rights. We currently directly hold various issued patents and patent applications, or have exclusive license or option rights to issued patents and patent applications, in each case in the U.S. as well as other countries that protect our products, product candidates and platform technologies. We anticipate filing additional patent applications both in the U.S. and in other countries. Our success will depend, in significant part, on our ability to obtain, maintain and defend our U.S. and foreign patents covering our products, product candidates and platform technologies as well as preserving our trade secrets for these assets. The patent process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining, maintaining, or defending our patents. Even when our patent claims are allowed, the claims may not issue, or in the event of issuance, may not be sufficient to protect our products, product candidates or platform technologies. The patent positions of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. This uncertainty is heightened for our PMO-based products and product candidates and gene therapy-based product candidates for which there has been little patent litigation involving such technologies. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents has emerged to date in the U.S. and tests used for determining the patentability of patent claims in all technologies are in flux. The USPTO and patent offices in other jurisdictions have often required that patent applications concerning pharmaceutical and/or biotechnology-related inventions be limited or narrowed substantially to cover only the specific innovations exemplified in the patent application, thereby limiting the scope of protection against competitive challenges. Accordingly, even if we or our licensors are able to obtain patents, the patents might be substantially narrower than anticipated. Thus, there is no assurance as to the degree and range of protections any of our patents, if issued, may afford us or whether patents will be issued. Patents which may be issued to us may be subjected to further governmental review that may ultimately result in the reduction of their scope of protection, and pending patent applications may have their requested breadth of protection significantly limited before being issued, if issued at all. The pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences patent situation outside the U.S. can be even more uncertain. As a matter of public policy, there might be significant pressure on governmental bodies to limit the scope of patent protection or impose compulsory licenses for disease treatments that prove successful, particularly as a tactic to impose a price control. Additionally, competitors may leverage such pressure to enhance their ability to exploit these laws to create, develop and market competing products. We may be able to assert that certain activities engaged in by our competitors infringe on our current or future patent rights. To the extent that we enforce our patents, an alleged infringer may deny infringement and/or counter-claim that our patents are not valid, and if successful, could negatively impact our patent estate. We may not be able to successfully defend patents necessary to prevent competitors from commercializing competing product candidates. Our patent rights might be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or otherwise not provide any competitive advantage. Defending our patent positions may require significant financial resources and could negatively impact other Company objectives. Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, one or more motivated third parties may file an ANDA, seeking approval of a generic copy of an innovator product approved under the NDA pathway such as our PMO products, or a NDA under Section 505(b)(2), which may be for a new or improved version of the original innovator products. The third parties are allowed to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the innovator’s product, may not need to conduct clinical trials and can market a competing version of a product after the expiration or loss of patent exclusivity or the expiration or loss of regulatory exclusivity and often charge significantly lower prices. Upon the expiration or loss of patent protection or the expiration or loss of regulatory exclusivity for a product, the major portion of revenues for that product may be dramatically reduced in a very short period of time. If we are not successful in defending our patents and regulatory exclusivities, we will not derive the expected benefit from them. As such, a third party could be positioned to market an ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) product that competes with one of our products prior to the expiry of our patents if the third party successfully challenged the validity of our patents protecting the product. -49- The DMD patent landscape is continually evolving, and we may be able to assert that certain activities engaged in by third parties infringe our current or future patent rights. There has been, and we believe that there will continue to be, significant litigation in the biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical industries regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. As such, the patents and patent applications that we own, license, have optioned, and rely on for exclusivity for our product candidates may be challenged. Uncertainty over intellectual property in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry has been the source of litigation and other disputes, which is inherently costly and unpredictable. Litigation, interferences, oppositions, inter partes reviews, administrative challenges or other similar types of proceedings are, have been and may in the future be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of certain of our proprietary rights, and in other instances to determine the validity, scope or non-infringement of certain patent rights claimed by third parties to be pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our products. We may also face challenges to our patent and regulatory exclusivities covering our products by third parties, including manufacturers of generics and biosimilars that may choose to launch or attempt to launch their products before the expiration of our patent or regulatory exclusivity. Litigation, interferences, oppositions, inter partes reviews, administrative challenges or other similar types of proceedings are unpredictable and may be protracted, expensive and distracting to management. The outcomes of such proceedings could adversely affect the validity and scope of our patents or other proprietary rights, hinder our ability to manufacture and market our products, require us to seek a license for the infringed products or technology or result in the assessment of significant monetary damages against us that may exceed amounts, if any, accrued in our financial statements. An adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or a failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products. Furthermore, payments under any licenses that we are able to obtain would reduce our profits derived from our products. Any of these circumstances could result in financial, business or reputational harm to us or could cause a decline or volatility in our stock price. On September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (the “Leahy-Smith Act”), was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law, including provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted, and may also affect patent litigation. The USPTO has issued regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act. In view of the long timelines for interpreting legal provisions in the court system and the evolving nature of our laws, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. For instance, a third party may petition the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“PTAB”) seeking to challenge the validity of some or all of the claims in any of our patents through an inter partes review or other post-grant proceeding. Should the PTAB institute an inter partes review or other proceeding and decide that some or all of the claims in the challenged patent are invalid, such a decision, if upheld on appeal, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Our business prospects will be impaired if third parties successfully assert that our products, product candidates, or platform technologies infringe proprietary rights of such third parties. Similar to us, competitors continually seek intellectual property protection for their technology. Several of our development programs, particularly gene therapy programs, focus on therapeutic areas that have been the subject of extensive research and development by third parties for many years and have been protected with third party patent rights. Due to the amount of intellectual property in our various fields of technology, we cannot be certain that we do not infringe intellectual property rights of competitors or other third parties or that we will not infringe intellectual property rights of competitors or other third parties granted or created in the future. Our competitors or other third parties might have obtained, or could obtain in the future, patents that limit, interfere with or eliminate our ability to make, use and sell our products, product candidates or platform technologies in important commercial markets. In order to maintain or obtain freedom to operate for our products and product candidates, we may incur significant expenses, including those associated with entering into agreements with third parties that require milestone and royalty payments. Additionally, if we were to challenge the patent rights of our competitors, we could incur substantial costs and ultimately might not be successful. If our products, product candidates, or platform technologies are alleged to infringe or are determined to infringe enforceable proprietary rights of others, we could incur substantial costs and may have to: • obtain rights or licenses from others, which might not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all; • abandon development of an infringing product candidate, or cease commercialization of an infringing product; • redesign our products, product candidates or processes to avoid infringement; • pay damages; and/or • defend litigation or administrative proceedings which might be costly whether we win or lose, and which could result in a substantial diversion of financial and management resources. -50- Any of these events could result in product and product candidate development delays or cessation, and as such substantially harm our potential earnings, financial condition and operations. The patent landscape of our product candidates is continually evolving and multiple parties, including both commercial entities and academic institutions, may have rights to claims or may be pursuing additional claims that could provide these parties a basis to assert that our product s , product candidates or platform technologies infringe on the intellectual property rights of such parties. There has been, and we believe that there will continue to be, significant litigation in the biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical industries regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Risks Related to our Business Operations If we fail to comply with healthcare and other regulations, we could face substantial penalties and our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. As a manufacturer of pharmaceuticals, within the U.S., certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations will apply to or affect our business. The laws and regulations include: • federal healthcare program anti-kickback laws, which prohibit, among other things, persons from soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid; • federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, information or claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent; • the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which among other things, strictly regulates drug product and medical device marketing, prohibits manufacturers from marketing such products for off-label use and regulates the distribution of samples; • federal laws that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to report certain calculated product prices to the government or provide certain discounts or rebates to government authorities or private entities, often as a condition of reimbursement under government healthcare programs; • the so-called “federal sunshine” law, which requires pharmaceutical and medical device companies to monitor and report certain financial interactions with physicians and teaching hospitals to the federal government for re-disclosure to the public; and • state law equivalents of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third party payor, including commercial insurers, state laws regulating interactions between pharmaceutical manufactures and health care providers, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by federal laws, thus complicating compliance efforts. The number and complexity of both federal and state laws continues to increase, and additional governmental resources are being used to enforce these laws and to prosecute companies and individuals who are believed to be violating them. We anticipate that government scrutiny of pharmaceutical sales and marketing practices will continue for the foreseeable future and subject us to the risk of government investigations and enforcement actions. In connection with the commercial launch of our products, we have enhanced our compliance program, which is based on industry best practices and is designed to ensure that the commercialization of our products complies with all applicable laws, regulations and industry standards. As the requirements in this area are constantly evolving, we cannot be certain that our program will eliminate all areas of potential exposure. Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other laws, rules or regulations that apply to us, we will be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Responding to government investigations, defending any claims raised, and any resulting fines, restitution, damages and penalties, settlement payments or administrative actions, as well as any related actions brought by stockholders or other third parties, could have a material impact on our reputation, business and financial condition and divert the attention of our management from operating our business. Even if we successfully defend against an action against us for violation of a law, the action and our defense could nonetheless cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state privacy, security, fraud and reporting laws may prove costly. -51- We may be subject to product liability claims and our insurance may not be adequate to cover damages. The current and future use of our product candidates by us and our collaborators in clinical trials, expanded access programs, the sale of our products, or the use of our products under emergency use vehicles may expose us to liability claims inherent to the manufacture, clinical testing, marketing and sale of medical products. These claims might be made directly by consumers or healthcare providers or indirectly by pharmaceutical companies, our collaborators or others selling such products. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, we may experience financial losses in the future due to such product liability claims. We have obtained commercial general liability insurance coverage for our clinical trials and the sale of commercial products. However, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against all losses. If a successful product liability claim or series of claims is brought against us for uninsured liabilities or in excess of insured liabilities, our assets may not be sufficient to cover such claims and our business operations could be impaired. If we, our collaborators, or any third-party manufacturers engaged by us or our collaborators fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could harm our business. We, our collaborators, and any third-party manufacturers we engage are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the generation, handling, use, storage, treatment, manufacture, transportation and disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous materials and wastes, as well as laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety, including those governing laboratory procedures, exposure to blood-borne pathogens and the handling of bio-hazardous materials. Our operations involve the use of hazardous materials, including organic and inorganic solvents and reagents. Although we believe that our activities conform in all material respects with such environmental laws, there can be no assurance that violations of these laws will not occur in the future as a result of human error, accident, equipment failure or other causes. Liability under environmental, health and safety laws can be joint and several and without regard to fault or negligence. The failure to comply with past, present or future laws could result in the imposition of substantial fines and penalties, remediation costs, property damage and personal injury claims, loss of permits or a cessation of operations, and any of these events could harm our business and financial condition. We expect that our operations will be affected by other new environmental, health and workplace safety laws on an ongoing basis, and although we cannot predict the ultimate impact of any such new laws, they may impose greater compliance costs or result in increased risks or penalties, which could harm our business. Further, with respect to the operations of any current or future collaborators or third party contract manufacturers, it is possible that if they fail to operate in compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or properly dispose of wastes associated with our product or product candidates, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, suffer reputational harm or experience a disruption in the manufacture and supply of our product or product candidates. Violation of the General Data Protection Regulation could subject us to significant fines. The GDPR increases our obligations with respect to clinical trials conducted in the member states of the EEA by expanding the definition of personal data to include coded data and requiring changes to informed consent practices and more detailed notices for clinical trial subjects and investigators. In addition, the GDPR increases the scrutiny that clinical trial sites located in the EEA should apply to transfers of personal data from such sites to countries that are considered to lack an adequate level of data protection, such as the U.S. The GDPR imposes substantial fines for breaches of data protection requirements, which can be up to four percent of global revenue or 20 million Euros, whichever is greater, and it also confers a private right of action on data subjects for breaches of data protection requirements. Compliance with these directives will be a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase our cost of doing business, and despite those efforts, there is a risk that we may be subject to fines and penalties, litigation and reputational harm in connection with our European activities. If we fail to retain our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional qualified personnel, our future growth and our ability to compete would suffer. We are highly dependent on the efforts and abilities of the principal members of our senior management. Additionally, we have scientific personnel with significant and unique expertise in RNA-targeted therapeutics and gene therapy technologies. The loss of the services of any one of the principal members of our managerial team or staff may prevent us from achieving our business objectives. The competition for qualified personnel in the biotechnology field is intense, and our future success depends upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate such personnel. In order to develop and commercialize our products successfully, we will be required to retain key management and scientific employees. In certain instances, we may also need to expand or replace our workforce and our management ranks. In addition, we rely on certain consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in the formulation and advancement of our research and development programs. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by other entities or have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with third parties that limit their availability to us, or both. If we are unable to attract, assimilate or retain such key personnel, our ability to advance our programs would be adversely affected. -52- We expect to expand our organization and may experience difficulties in managing this growth, which could disrupt our operations. As our business activities expand, we expect to expand our full-time employee base and to hire more consultants and contractors. Our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. Our ability to manage our growth properly and maintain compliance with all applicable rules and regulations will require us to continue to improve our operational, legal, financial and management controls, as well as our reporting systems and procedures. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Our expected growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of additional product candidates. If our management is unable to effectively manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate and/or grow revenues could be reduced, and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally. We are increasing our presence in international markets, including emerging markets, subjecting us to many risks that could adversely affect our business and revenues, such as: • the inability to obtain necessary foreign regulatory or pricing approvals of products in a timely manner; • uncertainties regarding the collectability of accounts receivable; • fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that may adversely impact our revenues, net income and value of certain of our investments; • difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; • the imposition of governmental controls; • less favorable intellectual property or other applicable laws; • increasingly complex standards for complying with foreign laws and regulations that may differ substantially from country to country and may conflict with corresponding U.S. laws and regulations; • the far-reaching anti-bribery and anti-corruption legislation in the U.K., including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, and elsewhere and escalation of investigations and prosecutions pursuant to such laws; • compliance with complex import and export control laws; • restrictions on direct investments by foreign entities and trade restrictions; and • changes in tax laws and tariffs. In addition, our international operations are subject to regulation under U.S. law. For example, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from paying, offering to pay, promising to pay or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to otherwise obtain favorable treatment or influence a person working in an official capacity. In many countries, the health care professionals we regularly interact with may meet the FCPA's definition of a foreign government official. Failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences, including: possible delay in approval or refusal to approve a product, recalls, seizures or withdrawal of an approved product from the market, disruption in the supply or availability of our products or suspension of export or import privileges, the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions, the prosecution of executives overseeing our international operations and damage to our reputation. Any significant impairment of our ability to sell products outside of the U.S. could adversely impact our business and financial results. Unfavorable global economic conditions could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our results of operations could be harmed by general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets. A severe or prolonged economic downturn could result in a variety of risks to our business, including weakened demand for our product candidates and our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. A weak or declining economy could strain our manufacturers, possibly resulting in manufacturing disruption, or cause delays in payments for our services by third-party payors or our future collaborators. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the current economic climate and financial market conditions could harm our business. -53- Additionally, in June 2016, a majority of United Kingdom ( “ UK ” ) voters voted for the UK to exit the EU (Brexit) and , on January 31, 2020 , the UK’s withdrawal became effective . A transition period will apply until the end of 2020 (or later, if extended) during which the pre-Brexit legal regime will continue to apply with the UK and the E U negotiate rules that will apply to their future relationship. The economic effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the UK makes to retain access to E U markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. Brexit could adversely affect European and worldwide economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial markets. Brexit is likely to lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the UK determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. Any of these effects of Brexit, and any other effects we cannot anticipate, could adversely affect our business, business opportunities, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology, including any cyber security incidents, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of the patients using our commercially approved products, clinical trial participants and employees. Similarly, our third-party providers possess certain of our sensitive data. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information, including our data being breached at third party providers, could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt our operations and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business. We may incur substantial costs in connection with litigation and other disputes. In the ordinary course of business we may, and in some cases have, become involved in lawsuits and other disputes such as securities claims, intellectual property challenges, including interferences declared by the USPTO, and employee matters. It is possible that we may not prevail in claims made against us in such disputes even after expending significant amounts of money and company resources in defending our positions in such lawsuits and disputes. The outcome of such lawsuits and disputes is inherently uncertain and may have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Comprehensive tax reform in the U.S. and future guidance could adversely affect our business and financial condition. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”) was enacted on December 22, 2017 in the U.S. The TCJA contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, elimination of U.S. tax on foreign earnings (subject to certain important exceptions), one-time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense, immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits. We continue to monitor for legislative developments, issuance of regulations and technical memorandum to provide further clarification and/or interpretations of the TCJA. Our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset future taxable income may be limited as a result of future transactions involving our common stock. In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, a corporation that undergoes an ‘‘ownership change’’ is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses and certain other tax assets to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders increases by more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders’ lowest percentage ownership during the testing period, which is generally three years. An ownership change could limit our ability to utilize our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for taxable years including or following such “ownership change.” Limitations imposed on the ability to use net operating losses and tax credits to offset future taxable income could require us to pay U.S. federal income taxes earlier than we estimated or than would have otherwise been required if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such net operating losses and tax credits to expire unused, in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such net operating losses and tax credits and potentially adversely affecting our financial position. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes. -54- We are winding down our expired U.S. government contract s , and the U.S. government may deny payment of some or all of the currently outstanding amounts owed to us . In addition, further development of our infectious disease p rograms may be limited by the intellectual property and other rights retained by the U.S. government. We have historically relied on U.S. government contracts and awards to fund and support certain infectious disease development programs. These contracts are expired and we are currently involved in contract close-out activities. The U.S. government has the right to perform additional audits prior to making final payment of costs and fees. If we are not able to adequately support costs incurred or other government requirements, the government may deny payment of some or all of the currently outstanding amounts owed to us. In addition, the U.S. government may have the right to develop all or some parts of product candidates that we have developed under a U.S. government contract after such contract has terminated or expired. Our employees, principal investigators, consultants and strategic partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading. We are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees, principal investigators, consultants and strategic partners. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional failures to comply with the regulations of the FDA and non-U.S. regulators, provide accurate information to the FDA and non-U.S. regulators, comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. We adopted a code of conduct applicable to all of our employees, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions. The increasing use of social media platforms presents new risks and challenges. Social media is increasingly being used to communicate about our products, technologies and programs, and the diseases our product and product candidates are designed to treat. Social media practices in the biopharmaceutical industry continue to evolve and regulations relating to such use are not always clear. This evolution creates uncertainty and risk of noncompliance with regulations applicable to our business. For example, patients may use social media channels to comment on the effectiveness of a product or to report an alleged adverse event. When such disclosures occur, there is a risk that we fail to monitor and comply with applicable adverse event reporting obligations or we may not be able to defend ourselves or the public's legitimate interests in the face of the political and market pressures generated by social media due to restrictions on what we may say about our product and/or product candidates. There is also a risk of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information or negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us on any social networking website. If any of these events were to occur or we otherwise fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could incur liability, face overly restrictive regulatory actions or incur other harm to our business. We or the third parties upon whom we depend may be adversely affected by natural disasters and/or health epidemics, and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster. Natural disasters could severely disrupt our operations, and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. If a natural disaster, power outage, health epidemics or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our office, manufacturing and/or lab spaces, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as the manufacturing facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. Our business could be adversely impacted by the effects of the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak originating in China, or by other epidemics. Although we do not currently source APIs or drug product from China, our supply chain for other raw materials and critical components is worldwide and accordingly could be subject to disruption. In addition, certain of our research and development efforts are conducted globally. A health epidemic or other outbreak, including the current coronavirus outbreak, may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place may prove inadequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. -55- Risks Related to our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements We have incurred operating losses since our inception and we may not achieve or sustain profitability. We incurred an operating loss of $705.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our accumulated deficit was $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2019. Although we currently have two commercially approved products in the U.S., we believe that it will take us some time to attain profitability and positive cash flow from operations. Since our products and product candidates target small patient populations, the per-patient drug pricing must be high in order to recover our development and manufacturing costs, fund adequate patient support programs, fund additional research and achieve profitability. We may be unable to maintain or obtain sufficient sales volumes at a price high enough to justify our product development efforts and our sales, marketing and manufacturing expenses. We have generally incurred expenses related to research and development of our technologies and product candidates and from general and administrative expenses that we have incurred while building our business infrastructure. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if and/or as we: • continue the commercialization of our products in the U.S.; • expand the global footprint of our products outside of the U.S.; • establish our sales, marketing and distribution capabilities; • continue our research, pre-clinical and clinical development of our product candidates; • respond to and satisfy requests and requirements from regulatory authorities in connection with development and potential approval of our product candidates; • initiate additional clinical trials for our product candidates; • seek marketing approvals for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; • acquire or in-license other product candidates; • maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; • increase manufacturing capabilities, including capital expenditures related to our real estate facilities and entering into manufacturing agreements; • hire additional clinical, quality control and scientific personnel; and • add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and planned future commercialization efforts. As a result, we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses at least through 2020. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing biopharmaceutical products, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when, or if, we will become profitable. We will need to raise additional funding, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed may force us to delay, limit or terminate our product development efforts or other operations. We will likely require additional capital from time to time in the future in order to meet FDA post-marketing approval requirements and market and sell our products as well as to continue the development of product candidates in our pipeline, to prepare for potential commercialization of our product candidates, to expand our product portfolio and to continue or enhance our business development efforts. The actual amount of funds that we may need and the sufficiency of the capital we have or are able to raise will be determined by many factors, some of which are in our control and others that are beyond our control. While we are currently well capitalized, we may use available capital resources sooner than we expect under our current operating plan. In addition, our operating plan may change. We may need or choose to seek additional funds sooner than planned, through equity or debt financings, government or other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements or a combination of these approaches. In any event, we expect to require additional capital to expand future development efforts, obtain regulatory approval for, and to commercialize, our product candidates. Raising funds in the current economic environment may present additional challenges. Even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans, we may seek additional capital if market conditions are favorable or in light of specific strategic considerations. -56- Any additional fundraising efforts may divert our management from their day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates. In addition, we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In the event we receive negative data from our key clinical programs or encounter other major setbacks in our development , manufacturing or regulatory activities or in our commercialization efforts, our stock price is likely to decline , which would make a future financing more difficult. Moreover, the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders. The issuance of additional securities, whether equity or debt, by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our shares to decline. The sale of additional equity or convertible securities would dilute all of our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and we may be required to agree to certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. We could also be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or otherwise at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable and we may be required to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product candidates or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects. If we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, we may be required to significantly curtail, delay or discontinue one or more of our research or development programs or the commercialization of any product, if approved, or be unable to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, as desired, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Raising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights. We may seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations and strategic and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of common stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock, the ownership interest of our stockholders in our company will be diluted. In addition, the terms of any such securities may include liquidation or other preferences that materially adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. Debt financing, if available, would increase our fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaboration, strategic partnerships and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our product candidates, our intellectual property, future revenue streams or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. The estimates and judgments we make, or the assumptions on which we rely, in preparing our consolidated financial statements could prove inaccurate. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the amounts of charges accrued by us and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Such estimates and judgments include revenue recognition, inventory, valuation of stock-based awards, research and development expenses and income tax. We base our estimates on historical experience, facts and circumstances known to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We cannot provide assurances, however, that our estimates, or the assumptions underlying them, will not change over time or otherwise prove inaccurate. If this is the case, we may be required to restate our consolidated financial statements, which could, in turn, subject us to securities class action litigation. Defending against such potential litigation relating to a restatement of our consolidated financial statements would be expensive and would require significant attention and resources of our management. Moreover, our insurance to cover our obligations with respect to the ultimate resolution of any such litigation may be inadequate. As a result of these factors, any such potential litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cause our stock price to decline, which could in turn subject us to securities class action litigation. -57- Risks Related to Our Common Stock Our stock price is volatile and may fluctuate due to factors beyond our control. The market prices for and trading volumes of securities of biotechnology companies, including our securities, has historically been volatile. Our stock has had significant swings in trading prices, in particular in connection with our public communications regarding feedback received from regulatory authorities. For example, over the last thirty-six months, our stock has increased as much as 37% in a single day or decreased as much as 15% in a single day. The market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors, including but not limited to: • the commercial performance of our products in the U.S.; • the timing of our submissions to regulatory authorities and regulatory decisions and developments; • positive or negative clinical trial results or regulatory interpretations of data collected in clinical trials conducted by us, our strategic partners, our competitors or other companies with investigational drugs targeting the same, similar or related diseases to those targeted by us; • delays in beginning and completing pre-clinical and clinical trials for potential product candidates; • delays in entering or failing to enter into strategic relationships with respect to development and/or commercialization of our products or product candidates or entry into strategic relationships on terms that are not deemed to be favorable to us; • technological innovations, product development or additional commercial product introductions by ourselves or competitors; • changes in applicable government regulations or regulatory requirements in the approval process; • developments concerning proprietary rights, including patents and patent litigation matters, such as developments in the interferences declared by the USPTO, including in the near term any outcomes of ongoing interference proceedings and over the longer term the outcomes from any related appeals; • public concern relating to the commercial value, efficacy or safety of any of our products; • our ability to obtain funds, through the issuance of equity or equity linked securities or incurrence of debt, or other corporate transactions; • comments by securities analysts; • developments in litigation against us; • changes in senior management; or • general market conditions in our industry or in the economy as a whole. Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of a company’s stock, including ours, regardless of actual operating performance. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources. Our revenues and operating results could fluctuate significantly, which may adversely affect our stock price. Our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from year-to-year and quarter-to-quarter as well as in comparison to the corresponding quarter of the preceding year. Variations my result from one or more factors, including, without limitation: • timing of purchase orders; • changes in coverage and reimbursement policies of health plans and other health insurers, especially in relation to those products that are currently manufactured, under development or identified for future development by us; • re-authorizations processes that may be required for patients who initially obtained coverage by third parties, including government payors, managed care organizations and private health insurers; • transition from temporary billing codes established by the CMS to permanent medical codes; • timing of approval of applications filed with the FDA; -58- • timing of product launches and market acceptance of products launched; • changes in the amounts spent to research, develop, acquire, license or promote new and existing products; • results of clinical trial programs; • serious or unexpected health or safety concerns with our product or product candidates and any resulting clinical holds; • introduction of new products by others that render one or more of our products obsolete or noncompetitive; • the ability to maintain selling prices and gross margins on our products; • increases in the cost of raw materials contained within our products and product candidates; • manufacturing and supply interruptions, including product rejections or recalls due to failure to comply with manufacturing specifications; • timing of revenue recognition relating to our distribution agreements; • the ability to protect our intellectual property from being acquired by other entities; • the ability to avoid infringing the intellectual property of others; and • the addition or loss of customers. In addition, in one or more future periods, our results of operations may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline. Provisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law might deter acquisition bids for us that might be considered favorable and prevent or frustrate any attempt to replace or remove the then-current management and board of directors. Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or effect a change in our board of directors and management. These provisions include: • when the board is comprised of six or more directors, classification of our board of directors into two classes, with one class elected each year; • directors may only be removed for cause by the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of voting stock; • prohibition of cumulative voting of shares in the election of directors; • right of the board of directors to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death, disqualification or removal of a director; • express authorization of the board of directors to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; • prohibition on stockholder action by written consent; • advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings; • the ability of our board of directors to authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms and rights of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, including rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock; and • a super-majority (66 2/3%) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock are required to amend, rescind, alter or repeal our bylaws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation. In addition, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws and in the Delaware General Corporation Law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by the then-current board of directors. A significant number of shares of our common stock are issuable pursuant to outstanding stock awards, and we expect to issue additional stock awards and shares of common stock to attract and retain employees, directors and consultants. We may also -59- issue shares of common stock to finance our operations and in connection with our strategic goals . Exercise of these awards and sales of shares will dilute the interests of existing security holders and may depress the price of our common stock. Currently, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 99.0 million shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2019, there were approximately 75.2 million shares of common stock outstanding and outstanding awards to purchase 9.1 million shares of common stock under various incentive stock plans. Additionally, as of December 31, 2019, there were approximately 3.4 million shares of common stock available for future issuance under our 2018 Equity Incentive Plan, approximately 0.6 million shares of common stock available for issuance under our Amended and Restated 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and approximately 0.6 million shares of common stock available for issuance under our 2014 Employment Commencement Incentive Plan. We may issue additional shares to grant equity awards to our employees, officers, directors and consultants under our 2018 Equity Incentive Plan, our 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan or our 2014 Employment Commencement Incentive Plan. We may also issue additional common stock and warrants from time to time to finance our operations and in connection with strategic transactions, such as acquisitions and licensing. For example, in February 2020, we issued and sold 2,522,227 shares of common stock to Roche Finance in connection with the entry into the collaboration agreement with Roche. We will need to increase our authorized shares of common stock under our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to support these strategic goals. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain shareholder approval to increase the number of authorized shares. The issuance of additional shares of common stock or warrants to purchase common stock and the perception that such issuances may occur or exercise of outstanding warrants or stock options may have a dilutive impact on other stockholders and could have a material negative effect on the market price of our common stock. Future sales of our common stock in the public market could cause our share price to fall. Sales of a substantial number of our common stock in the public market, including sales by members of our management or board of directors, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity or equity-related securities. Risks Related to Our Credit Agreement and Convertible Senior Notes Our indebtedness resulting from our credit agreement could adversely affect our financial condition or restrict our future operations. On December 13, 2019, we entered into a loan agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with BioPharma Credit PLC, as the collateral agent and a lender (“BioPharma”), and BioPharma Credit Investments V (Master) LP, as a lender (together with BioPharma in its capacity as a lender, and each of their respective successors and assigns at any time party to the Credit Agreement, the “Lenders” and each a “Lender”) that provides for a senior secured term loan facility of up to $500.0 million to be funded in two tranches: (i) a Tranche A Loan in an aggregate principal amount of $250.0 million (the “Tranche A Loan”), which was funded on December 20, 2019; and (ii) a Tranche B Loan in an aggregate principal amount of up to $250.0 million (the “Tranche B Loan”, and together with the Tranche A Loan, the “Term Loans”), to be funded at our option in increments of $50.0 million, which proposed funding date shall be 75 days following the delivery of notice and in no event later than December 31, 2020. There is no assurance that the Lenders will fund the Tranche B Loan if and when requested. All obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured pursuant to the terms of a security agreement and subject to certain exceptions, by security interests in certain collateral (collectively, the “Collateral”), which includes the following: (1) any and all U.S. intellectual property owned by, and rights to U.S. intellectual property licensed to, us relating to any pharmaceutical composition in which eteplirsen or golodirsen is indicated to be administered for use in the treatment of DMD in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 51 or 53 skipping, respectively, or for any other use approved by the FDA (the “Loan Products”), (2) 100% of the equity interests directly held by us in certain wholly owned domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the equity interests in certain other wholly owned domestic subsidiaries, and (3) all of our personal property, including, without limitation, cash held in all our deposit accounts. Any non-U.S. intellectual property related to the Loan Products and intellectual property unrelated in any way to the Loan Products anywhere are not part of the Collateral. The Credit Agreement contains negative covenants that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, restrict our ability to: • sell or dispose of assets, including certain intellectual property; • amend, modify or waive certain material agreements or organizational documents; • consolidate or merge; • incur additional indebtedness; • incur additional liens on the Collateral; • pay dividends or make any distribution or payment on or redeem, retire or purchase any equity interests; and -60- • make payments of certain subordinated indebtedness. The Credit Agreement requires us to have consolidated liquidity of at least $100.0 million as of the last day of each month. Additionally, the Credit Agreement contains certain representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and provisions relating to events of default, which include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) nonpayment of principal, interest and other amounts; (ii) failure to comply with covenants; (iii) the occurrence of a material adverse change in (A) our ability to fulfill the payment or performance obligations under the Credit Agreement and related documents or (B) the binding nature of the Credit Agreement and related documents; (iv) the rendering of judgments or orders or the acceleration or payment default by us in respect of other indebtedness in excess of $10.0 million; and (v) certain insolvency and ERISA events. A change of control triggers a mandatory prepayment of the Term Loans, and we may not have sufficient funds or the ability to raise the funds necessary to prepay them. Servicing our Credit Agreement and 1.50% notes due 2024 (the “Notes”) requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow to pay our debt. In 2017, we issued $570.0 million aggregate principal amount of Notes, pursuant to that certain indenture, dated as of November 14, 2019, between us, as issuer, and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness, including the Credit Agreement and the Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to many factors, including, economic, financial, competitive and other, beyond our control. We do not expect our business to be able to generate cash flow from operations in the foreseeable future, sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures and we may therefore be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance the Credit Agreement, which matures in 2023, and the Notes, which are non-callable and mature in 2024, will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations, and limit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business. We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to repurchase the Notes as required upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to repurchase the Notes. Holders of the Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their Notes for cash upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. A fundamental change may also constitute an event of default or prepayment under, and result in the acceleration of the maturity of, our then-existing indebtedness. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient financial resources, or will be able to arrange financing, to pay the fundamental change repurchase price in cash with respect to any Notes surrendered by holders for repurchase upon a fundamental change. In addition, restrictions under our then existing credit facilities or other indebtedness, if any, may not allow us to repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change. Our failure to repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change when required would result in an event of default with respect to the Notes which could, in turn, constitute a default under the terms of our other indebtedness, if any. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Notes. Capped call transactions entered into in connection with the Notes may impact the value of our common stock. In connection with the Notes, we entered into capped call transactions (the “Capped Call Transactions”) with certain financial institutions. The Capped Call Transactions are expected to generally reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the Notes into shares of our common stock. In connection with establishing their initial hedges of the Capped Call Transactions, these financial institutions or their respective affiliates entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock and/or to purchase our common stock. The financial institutions, or their respective affiliates, may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Notes. This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the Notes, which could affect the value of our common stock. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None. Item 2. Properties. A description of the facilities we own and/or occupy is included in the following table.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Please review our legend titled “Forward-Looking Information” at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K which is incorporated herein by reference. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below, and those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Throughout this discussion, unless the context specifies or implies otherwise, the terms “Sarepta”, “we”, “us” and “our” refer to Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. and its subsidiaries. This section discusses 2019 and 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018. Discussions of 2017 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2018 and 2017 have been excluded from this Form 10-K and can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. Overview We are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on helping patients through the discovery and development of unique RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene therapy and other genetic therapeutic modalities for the treatment of rare diseases. Applying our proprietary, highly-differentiated and innovative technologies, and through collaborations with our strategic partners, we are developing potential therapeutic candidates for a broad range of diseases and disorders, including DMD, LGMDs, MPS IIIA and other CNS related disorders. Our first commercial product, EXONDYS 51, was granted accelerated approval by the FDA on September 19, 2016. EXONDYS 51 is indicated for the treatment of DMD in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 51 skipping. EXONDYS 51 uses our PMO chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 51 of the dystrophin gene. Our second commercial product, VYONDYS 53, was granted accelerated approval by the FDA on December 12, 2019. VYONDYS 53 is indicated for the treatment of DMD in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 53 skipping. VYONDYS 53 uses our PMO chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 53 of the dystrophin gene. A summary description of our key product candidates, including those in collaboration with our strategic partners, is as follows: • Casimersen (SRP-4045) uses our PMO chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 45 of the DMD gene. Casimersen is designed to bind to exon 45 of dystrophin pre-mRNA, resulting in exclusion, or “skipping”, of this exon during mRNA processing in patients with genetic mutations that are amenable to exon 45 skipping. We are enrolling and dosing patients in ESSENCE (4045-301), our Phase 3 placebo controlled confirmatory trial in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 45 or 53 skipping using casimersen and golodirsen, respectively. On March 28, 2019, we announced results from our interim analysis of muscle biopsy endpoints comparing casimersen treatment to placebo in the ESSENCE study. In January 2020, we commenced a rolling submission of an NDA to the FDA seeking accelerated approval for casimersen. • SRP-5051 uses our next-generation chemistry platform, PPMO, and our exon-skipping technology to skip exon 51 of the dystrophin gene. SRP-5051, a peptide conjugated PMO, is designed to bind to exon 51 of dystrophin pre-mRNA, resulting in exclusion of this exon during mRNA processing in patients with genetic mutations that are amenable to exon 51 skipping. Exon skipping is intended to promote the production of an internally truncated but functional dystrophin protein. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we commenced a first-in-human, single ascending dose, study for the treatment of DMD in patients who are amenable to exon 51 skipping. In 2019, we commenced a multiple ascending dose, study for the treatment of DMD with SRP-5051 in patients who are amenable to exon 51 skipping, and we expect to have safety and dosing insights in the middle of 2020. • SRP-9001 (DMD, micro-dystrophin gene therapy program) , aims to express micro-dystrophin – a smaller but still functional version of dystrophin. A unique, engineered micro-dystrophin is used because naturally-occurring dystrophin is too large to fit in an AAV vector. In the fourth quarter of 2017, an IND application for the micro-dystrophin gene therapy program was cleared by the FDA, and a Phase 1/2a clinical trial in individuals with DMD was initiated. On October 3, 2018, Nationwide presented what we believe to be positive results from the Phase 1/2a clinical trial in four individuals with DMD enrolled in the trial. On March 25, 2019, we presented nine-month functional and CK data from baseline from these four individuals, and twelve-month CK data from baseline from one of these individuals. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we commenced a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of SRP-9001 with the goal to establish the functional benefits of micro-dystrophin expressions. We have dosed all 41 participants in that trial and have begun dosing participants in the crossover phase of the study. We plan to commence a trial evaluating SRP-9001 using commercial supply in the middle of 2020, pending regulatory feedback. -65- • SRP - 90 0 3 (LGMD, gene therapy program) . We are developing gene therapy programs for various forms of LGMDs. The most advanced of our LGMD product candidates , SRP - 90 0 3 , is designed to transfer a gene that codes for and restores beta-sarcoglycan protein with the goal of restoring the dystrophin associated protein complex. It utilizes the AAVrh.74 vector system, the same vector used in the micro-dystrophin gene therapy program we are developing with Nationwide. A Phase 1/2a trial of SRP - 90 0 3 was commenced in the fourth quarter of 2018 . O n February 27, 2019, we announced positive two-month biopsy data from the first three-patient cohort dosed in the SRP - 9 0 03 trial , and on October 4, 2019, we announced positive nine-month functional data from these three patients. We have recently dosed one additional cohort of three patients at a higher dose per the study protocol . We expect to have the results from the second cohort and make a dose selection in the third quarter of 2020 . • LYS-SAF 302 . We are collaborating with Lysogene to develop a gene therapy, LYS-SAF302, to treat MPS IIIA. Lysogene is conducting a global Phase 2/3 clinical trial of LYS-SAF302 (AAVance) to evaluate the effectiveness of a one-time delivery of an AAVrh.10 virus carrying the N-SGSH gene. We expect to complete dosing in this trial in the first half of 2020. Our pipeline includes more than 40 programs in various stages of pre-clinical and clinical development, reflecting our aspiration to apply our multifaceted approach and expertise in precision genetic medicine to make a profound difference in the lives of patients suffering from rare diseases. We have developed proprietary state-of-the-art CMC and manufacturing capabilities that allow synthesis and purification of our products and product candidates to support both clinical development as well as commercialization. Our current main focus in manufacturing is to continue scaling up production of our PMO-based therapies and optimizing manufacturing for PPMO and gene therapy-based product candidates. We have entered into certain manufacturing and supply arrangements with third-party suppliers which will in part utilize these capabilities to support production of certain of our products and product candidates and their components. In 2017, we opened a facility in Andover, Massachusetts, which significantly enhanced our research and development manufacturing capabilities. However, we currently do not have internal large scale GMP manufacturing capabilities to produce our products and product candidates for commercial and/or clinical use. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $1,134.4 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments, consisting of $835.1 million of cash and cash equivalents, $289.7 million of short-term investments and $9.6 million of long-term restricted cash and investments. We believe that our balance of cash, cash equivalents and investments is sufficient to fund our current operational plan for at least the next twelve months. The likelihood of our long-term success must be considered in light of the expenses, difficulties and delays frequently encountered in the development and commercialization of new pharmaceutical products, competitive factors in the marketplace and the complex regulatory environment in which we operate. We may never achieve significant revenue or profitable operations. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities for the periods presented. Some of these judgments can be subjective and complex, and, consequently, actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe that the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon historical experience and information available to us at the time that we make these estimates and judgments. To the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our consolidated financial statements will be affected. Although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate, actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: • revenue recognition; • i nventory; and • income tax. Revenue Recognition To determine revenue recognition for arrangements within the scope of ASC 606, we perform the following five steps: (1) identify the contracts with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation. -66- Variable Consideration Product revenues are recorded at the net sales price (transaction price) which includes estimated reserves for variable consideration, such as Medicaid rebates, governmental chargebacks, including PHS chargebacks, prompt payment discounts, co-pay assistance and distribution fees. These reserves are based on the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if no payment is required by us) or a current liability (if a payment is required by us). These reserves reflect our best estimates of the amount of consideration to which we are entitled based on the terms of the contracts. Additional details relating to variable consideration follows: • Medicaid rebates relate to our estimated obligations to states under established reimbursement arrangements. Rebate reserves are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a liability which is included in accrued expenses. • Governmental chargebacks, including PHS chargebacks, relate to our estimated obligations resulting from contractual commitments to sell products to qualified healthcare providers at prices lower than the list prices that we charge to wholesalers. The wholesaler charges us for the difference between what the wholesaler pays for the products and the ultimate selling price to the qualified healthcare providers. Chargeback reserves are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and accounts receivable. Chargeback amounts are generally determined at the time of resale to the qualified healthcare provider from the wholesaler, and we generally issue credits for such amounts within a few weeks of receiving notification of resale from the wholesaler. • Prompt payment discounts relate to our estimated obligations for credits to be granted to specialty pharmacies for remitting payment on their purchases within established incentive periods. Reserves for prompt payment discounts are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and accounts receivable. • Co-pay assistance relates to financial assistance provided to qualified patients, whereby we may assist them with prescription drug co-payments required by the patient’s insurance provider. Reserves for co-pay assistance are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a liability which is included in accrued expenses. • Distribution fees relate to fees paid to customers in the distribution channel that provide us with inventory management, data and distribution services and are generally accounted for as a reduction of revenue. To the extent that the services received are distinct from our sale of products to the customer, these payments are accounted for as selling, general and administrative expenses. Reserves for distribution fees result in an increase in a liability if payments are required of us or a reduction of accounts receivable if no payments are required of us. Please read Note 7, Accounts Receivable and Reserves for Product Sales to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of revenue recognition. Inventory Valuation Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. We capitalize inventory costs associated with products following regulatory approval when future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized. EXONDYS 51 and VYONDYS 53 inventory that may be used in clinical development programs is charged to research and development expense when the product enters the research and development process and no longer can be used for commercial purposes. We periodically review our inventories for excess amounts or obsolescence and write down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value. Additionally, though our products are subject to strict quality control and monitoring, which we perform throughout the manufacturing processes, certain batches or units of product may not meet quality specifications resulting in a charge to cost of sales. Income Tax We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon an examination. The calculation of our tax liabilities resulting from uncertain tax positions can involve significant judgment. Further, the calculation may involve the application of complex tax regulations in a foreign jurisdiction. Although we believe that we have adequately provided for tax liabilities resulting from uncertain tax positions, the actual amounts paid, if any, could have a material impact on our results of operations. Interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions are classified as a component of income tax expense. Please read Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates. -67- The following table sets forth selected consolidated statements of operations data for each of the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 Change Change (in thousands, except per share amounts) $ % Revenues: Product, net $ 380,833 $ 301,034 $ 79,799 27 % Total revenues 380,833 301,034 79,799 27 % Cost and expenses: Cost of sales (excluding amortization of in-licensed rights) 56,586 34,193 22,393 65 % Research and development 560,909 401,843 159,066 40 % Selling, general and administrative 284,812 207,761 77,051 37 % Acquired in-process research and development 173,240 — 173,240 NM* Settlement and license charges 10,000 — 10,000 NM* Amortization of in-licensed rights 849 865 (16 ) (2 )% Total cost and expenses 1,086,396 644,662 441,734 69 % Operating loss (705,563 ) (343,628 ) (361,935 ) 105 % Other loss: Other expense, net (8,317 ) (18,982 ) 10,665 (56 )% Loss before income tax expense (benefit) (713,880 ) (362,610 ) (351,270 ) 97 % Income tax expense (benefit) 1,195 (692 ) 1,887 (273 )% Net loss $ (715,075 ) $ (361,918 ) $ (353,157 ) 98 % Net loss per share — basic and diluted $ (9.71 ) $ (5.46 ) $ (4.25 ) 78 % * NM: not meaningful Revenues Revenues from product sales are recorded at the net sales price (transaction price), which includes estimates of variable consideration for which reserves are established and which result from Medicaid rebates, governmental chargebacks, including PHS chargebacks, prompt pay discounts, co-pay assistance and distribution fees. These reserves are based on the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if no payments are required of us) or a current liability (if a payment is required of us). These reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. Our estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements. The amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price may be constrained and is included in the net sales price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur in a future period. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received or paid may differ from our estimates. If actual results in the future vary from our estimates, we will adjust these estimates, which would affect net product revenue and net loss in the period such variances become known. Net product revenues for our products for 2019 increased by $79.8 million compared with 2018. The increase primarily reflects the continuing increase in demand for EXONDYS 51 in the U.S. Cost of sales (excluding amortization of in-licensed rights) Our cost of sales (excluding amortization of in-licensed rights) primarily consists of inventory costs that relate to sales of our products following their commercial launches in the U.S., royalty payments, and other inventory costs. Prior to receiving regulatory approval for EXONDYS 51 and VYONDYS 53 by the FDA in September 2016 and December 2019, respectively, we expensed such manufacturing and material costs as research and development expenses. For VYONDYS 53 sold in 2019, the majority of related manufacturing costs incurred had previously been expensed as research and development expenses, as such costs were incurred prior to the FDA approval of the products. For EXONDYS 51 sold in 2018 and 2019, only part of the related manufacturing costs incurred had previously been expensed as research and development expenses. If product related costs had not previously been expensed as research and development expenses prior to receiving FDA approval, the incremental inventory costs related to our products sold in 2019 and 2018 would have been approximately $12.4 million and $12.6 million, respectively. -68- I n addition to royalty payments to BioMarin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“BioMarin”), during the second quarter of 2019, we began to pay the University of Western Australia (“UWA”) a low-single-digit percentage royalty on net sales of products covered by issued patents licensed from UWA. The following table summarizes the components of our cost of sales for the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 Change Change (in thousands) $ % Inventory costs related to products sold $ 28,891 $ 13,370 $ 15,521 116 % Royalty payments 22,923 15,065 7,858 52 % Other inventory costs 4,772 5,758 (986 ) (17 )% Total cost of sales $ 56,586 $ 34,193 $ 22,393 65 % The cost of sales for 2019 increased $22.4 million, or 65%, compared with 2018. The increase was primarily driven by the following: • $15.5 million and $7.9 million increases in inventory costs related to products sold and royalty payments to BioMarin and UWA, respectively, primarily as a result of the increasing demand for EXONDYS 51 during 2019; and • $1.0 million decrease in other inventory costs as a result of a reduction in write-offs of certain batches of EXONDYS 51 not meeting our quality specifications. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses consist of costs associated with research activities as well as costs associated with our product development efforts, conducting pre-clinical trials, clinical trials and manufacturing activities. Direct research and development expenses associated with our programs include clinical trial site costs, clinical manufacturing costs, costs incurred for consultants, up-front fees and milestones paid to third parties in connection with technologies that have not reached technological feasibility and do not have an alternative future use, and other external services, such as data management and statistical analysis support, and materials and supplies used in support of clinical programs. Indirect costs of our clinical programs include salaries, stock-based compensation and allocation of our facility and technology costs. Research and development expenses represent a substantial percentage of our total operating expenses. We do not maintain or evaluate and, therefore, do not allocate internal research and development costs on a project-by-project basis. As a result, a significant portion of our research and development expenses are not tracked on a project-by-project basis, as the costs may benefit multiple projects. The following table summarizes our research and development expenses by project for each of the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 Change Change (in thousands) $ % Gene therapies $ 123,210 $ 8,880 $ 114,330 NM* Up-front, milestone, and other expenses 103,162 142,413 (39,251 ) (28 )% Eteplirsen (exon 51) 47,042 32,056 14,986 47 % Casimersen (exon 45) 27,095 26,758 337 1 % Golodirsen (exon 53) 21,390 25,875 (4,485 ) (17 )% PPMO platform 19,082 23,911 (4,829 ) (20 )% Collaboration cost-sharing 9,416 8,599 817 10 % Other projects 3,262 2,135 1,127 53 % Internal research and development expenses 207,250 131,216 76,034 58 % Total research and development expenses $ 560,909 $ 401,843 $ 159,066 40 % * NM: not meaningful -69- The following table summarizes our research and development expenses by category for each of the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 Change Change (in thousands) $ % Clinical and manufacturing expenses $ 222,178 $ 111,101 $ 111,077 100 % Up-front, milestone, and other expenses 103,162 142,413 (39,251 ) (28 )% Compensation and other personnel expenses 89,639 49,701 39,938 80 % Facility- and technology-related expenses 46,556 16,555 30,001 181 % Stock-based compensation 27,681 14,214 13,467 95 % Professional services 22,965 17,926 5,039 28 % Pre-clinical expenses 11,729 22,992 (11,263 ) (49 )% Collaboration cost-sharing 9,416 8,599 817 10 % Research and other 27,583 18,342 9,241 50 % Total research and development expenses $ 560,909 $ 401,843 $ 159,066 40 % Research and development expenses for 2019 increased by $159.1 million, or 40%, compared with 2018. The increase was primarily driven by the following: • $111.1 million increase in clinical and manufacturing expenses primarily due to a ramp-up of manufacturing activities for our gene therapy programs (including our micro-dystrophin program), increased patient enrollment in our ESSENCE trial, and initiation of certain post-market studies for EXONDYS 51. These increases were partially offset by a ramp-down of clinical trials in EXONDYS 51, including the PROMOVI trial and the Phase 1/2 trial in VYONDYS 53; • $39.3 million decrease in up-front, milestone, and other expenses, primarily due to $46.9 million of up-front cash and equity payments to StrideBio as a result of the execution of a license and collaboration agreement in November 2019, a $28.0 million up-front payment to Genethon as a result of the execution of a license and collaboration agreement in November 2019, and $25.6 million of up-front and milestone payments made to various academic institutions throughout 2019, as compared with $85.0 million up-front and milestone payments to Myonexus as a result of the execution of a warrant agreement in May 2018 as well as certain development milestones being achieved, $44.8 million up-front and milestone payments to Lysogene as a result of the execution of a collaboration and license agreement in October 2018 as well as certain development milestones becoming probable of being achieved, and $8.0 million related to the purchase of a license to develop, manufacture and commercialize a pre-clinical Pompe product candidate under a license agreement with Lacerta in August 2018 ; • $39.9 million increase in compensation and other personnel expenses primarily due to a net increase in headcount; • $30.0 million increase in facility- and technology-related expenses due to our continuing global expansion efforts as well as a change in methodology in allocation of technology expense; • $13.5 million increase in stock-based compensation expense primarily driven by increases in headcount and stock price; • $5.0 million increase in professional services primarily due to continuing accelerated company growth as a result of expansion of our research and development pipeline; • $11.3 million decrease in pre-clinical expenses primarily due to the completion of certain toxicology studies in our PPMO platform; • $0.8 million increase in collaboration cost-sharing driven by collaboration cost-sharing with Genethon on its microdystrophin platform, offset by a decrease in collaboration cost-sharing with Summit (Oxford) Ltd. as it wound down activities on its Utrophin platform; and • $9.2 million increase in research and other primarily driven by a $7.1 million increase in lab supplies as a result of an increase in headcount as well as a $3.0 million increase in sponsored research with academic institutions, partially offset by a reduction of $3.8 million in loss due to impairment of certain patents from 2018. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and related costs for personnel in our executive, finance, legal, information technology, business development, human resources, commercial and other general and administrative functions. Other general and administrative expenses include an allocation of our facility and technology costs and professional fees for legal, consulting and accounting services. -70- The following table summarizes our selling, general and administrative expenses by category for each of the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 Change Change (in thousands) $ % Compensation and other personnel expenses $ 105,998 $ 72,042 $ 33,956 47 % Professional services 91,384 78,856 12,528 16 % Stock-based compensation 50,921 35,913 15,008 42 % Facility- and technology-related expenses 27,249 10,729 16,520 154 % Restructuring expenses — (2,222 ) 2,222 (100 )% Other 9,260 12,443 (3,183 ) (26 )% Total selling, general and administrative expenses $ 284,812 $ 207,761 $ 77,051 37 % Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2019 increased by $77.1 million, or 37%, compared with 2018. This was primarily driven by the following: • $34.0 million increase in compensation and other personnel expenses primarily due to a net increase in headcount; • $12.5 million increase in professional services primarily due to continuing global expansion; • $15.0 million increase in stock-based compensation primarily due to increases in headcount and stock price ; • $16.5 million increase in facility- and technology-related expense primarily due to continuing global expansion offset by a decrease in technology expense due to a change in allocation methodology; and • $2.2 million decrease in restructuring credits due to the relief of cease-use liabilities as a result of the termination of the rental agreement for our Corvallis facility recorded during the second quarter of 2018 . Acquired In-process Research and Development As a result of the Myonexus acquisition, we recorded acquired in-process research and development expense of approximately $173.2 million during the second quarter of 2019. There was no such transaction during the same period of 2018 . Settlement and License Charges In December 2019, we recognized a $10.0 million settlement charge related to contingent settlement payments to BioMarin as a result of the approval of VYONDYS 53. This was a result of a settlement and license agreement with BioMarin in July 2017. There was no such expense recognized during the same period of 2018. Amortization of In-licensed Rights Amortization of in-licensed rights relate to the agreements we entered into with BioMarin and UWA in July 2017 and April 2011, respectively. We recorded an in-licensed right asset of approximately $6.6 million in 2017 as a result of the settlement and license agreements with BioMarin. Additionally, following the first sale of EXONDYS 51 in September 2016 and VYONDYS 53 in December 2019, we recorded an in-licensed right asset of $1.0 million and $0.5 million, respectively, related to the license agreement with UWA. Each in-licensed right is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the patent from the first commercial sale of each product. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recorded amortization of in-licensed rights of approximately $0.8 million and $0.9 million, respectively. Other expense, net Other expense, net, primarily consists of interest income on our cash, cash equivalents and investments, interest expense on our debt facilities, amortization of investment discount, gain from our investment in Lysogene, and rental income and loss. Our cash equivalents and investments consist of money market funds, commercial paper, government and government agency debt securities, corporate debt securities and certificates of deposit. Interest expense primarily includes interest accrued on our convertible notes, term loan, revolving line of credit and a mortgage loan related to our Corvallis, Oregon property. Rental income and loss is from leasing excess space in some of our facilities. Other expense, net, for 2019 decreased by $10.7 million compared with 2018. The decrease primarily reflected decreases in term loan termination expense and an increase in amortization of investment discount as a result of an increase in interest rates. -71- Income tax expense (benefit) Income tax expense for 2019 was approximately $1.2 million, which primarily reflected adjustments to estimated foreign and current state income taxes in 2019. Income tax benefit for 2018 was approximately $0.7 million, which primarily reflected adjustments to estimated state income taxes in 2017. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes our financial condition for each of the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 Change Change (in thousands) $ % Financial assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 835,080 $ 370,829 $ 464,251 125 % Short-term investments 289,668 803,083 (513,415 ) (64 )% Restricted cash and investments 9,566 1,001 8,565 NM* Total cash, cash equivalents and investments $ 1,134,314 $ 1,174,913 $ (40,599 ) (3 )% Borrowings: Long-term debt $ 240,004 $ — $ 240,004 NM* Convertible debt 441,896 420,554 21,342 5 % Total borrowings $ 681,900 $ 420,554 $ 261,346 62 % Working capital Current assets 1,468,913 1,426,183 42,730 3 % Current liabilities 264,767 173,690 91,077 52 % Total working capital $ 1,204,146 $ 1,252,493 $ (48,347 ) (4 )% * NM: not meaningful For the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, our principal source of liquidity was derived from proceeds from sales of our products and debt and equity financings. Our principal uses of cash are research and development expenses, selling, general and administrative expenses, investments, capital expenditures, business development transactions and other working capital requirements. Our future expenditures and capital requirements may be substantial and will depend on many factors, including but not limited to the following: • our ability to continue to generate revenues from sales of EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53, and potential future products; • the timing and costs associated with our continuing global expansion; • the timing and costs of building out our manufacturing capabilities; • the timing of advanced payments related to our future inventory commitments and manufacturing obligations; • the timing and costs associated with our clinical trials and pre-clinical trials; • the attainment of milestones and our obligations to make milestone payments to Myonexus’ selling shareholders, StrideBio, BioMarin, Lysogene, Lacerta, Nationwide, UWA and other institutions; • repayment of outstanding debt; and • the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and our other intellectual property rights. Our cash requirements are expected to continue to increase as we advance our research, development and commercialization programs and we expect to seek additional financings primarily from, but not limited to, the sale and issuance of equity and debt securities, or the licensing or sale of our technologies or additional government contracts. We cannot provide assurances that financing will be available when and as needed or that, if available, the financings will be on favorable or acceptable terms. If we are unable to obtain additional financing when and if we require, this would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. To the extent we issue additional equity securities, our existing stockholders could experience substantial dilution. -72- Cash Flows The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for each of the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 Change Change (in thousands) $ % Cash provided by (used in) Operating activities $ (456,463 ) $ (388,660 ) $ (67,803 ) 17 % Investing activities 286,725 (370,488 ) 657,213 (177 )% Financing activities 642,554 530,150 112,404 21 % Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 472,816 $ (228,998 ) $ 701,814 (306 )% Operating Activities. Cash used in operating activities increased by $67.8 million for 2019 compared with 2018, primarily due to the following: • $179.9 million increase in net loss excluding acquired in-process research and development expense primarily driven by increases in research and development expense and selling, general and administrative expense partially offset by an increase in net product revenues for EXONDYS 51 and VYONDYS 53. The increases were partially offset by: • $41.7 million increase in non-cash adjustments; and • $41.0 million increase in use of operating assets and liabilities. Investing Activities. Cash provided by investing activities was $286.7 million for 2019. Cash used in investing activities for 2018 was $370.5 million. The favorable change was primarily due to the following: • $849.8 million increase in proceeds from the maturity or sale of available-for-sale securities; and, • $1.5 million decrease in purchase of property and equipment. The increases were partially offset by: • $172.6 million increase as a result of the acquisition of Myonexus; and • $22.0 million increase in the purchase of available-for-sale securities. Financing Activities. Cash provided by financing activities increased by $112.4 million for 2019 compared with 2018, primarily driven by the following: • $9.8 million increase in proceeds from debt financings; and • $269.4 million decrease in repayment of outstanding debts and debt extinguishment costs. The increases were partially offset by: • $148.1 million decrease in proceeds from sales of common stock; • $13.6 million decrease in proceeds from the exercise of options and our employee stock purchase program; and • $4.3 million increase in taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements During the periods presented, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or for another contractually narrow or limited purpose. -73- Contractual Payment Obligations In our continuing operations, we have entered into long-term contractual arrangements from time to time for our facilities, the provision of goods and services, and issuance of debt securities, among others. The following table presents contractual obligations arising from these arrangements as of December 31, 2019: Payment Due by Period Total Less Than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3 - 5 Years More than 5 Years (in thousands) Convertible debt (1) $ 611,681 $ 8,550 $ 17,100 $ 586,031 $ — Term loan (1) 336,299 22,313 43,090 270,896 — Lease obligations 68,044 11,718 23,971 22,701 9,654 Manufacturing obligations (2) 893,036 378,744 248,314 116,628 149,350 Total contractual obligations $ 1,909,060 $ 421,325 $ 332,475 $ 996,256 $ 159,004 (1) Interest is included. (2) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding or subject to cancellation fees and that specify all significant terms. Purchase obligations relate primarily to our commercialization of EXONDYS 51 and VYONDYS 53, and clinical programs for DMD and gene therapy programs. Milestone Obligations For products and product candidates that are currently in various research and development stages, we may be obligated to make up to $3.0 billion of future development, regulatory, up-front royalty and sales milestone payments associated with our collaboration and license agreements. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable upon achievement of certain development, regulatory or sales milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones is not probable and payment is not required as of December 31, 2019, such contingencies have not been recorded in our consolidated financial statements. Amounts related to contingent milestone payments are not yet considered contractual obligations as they are contingent on the successful achievement of certain development, regulatory approval and sales milestones. Other Funding Commitments We have several on-going clinical trials in various stages. Our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to contract research organizations (“CROs”). The CRO contracts are generally cancellable at our option. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $91.4 million in cancellable future commitments based on existing CRO contracts. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Please read Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Our current investment policy is to maintain a diversified investment portfolio consisting of money market investments, commercial paper, government and government agency bonds and high-grade corporate bonds with maturities of 36 months or less. Our cash is deposited in and invested through highly rated financial institutions in North America. As of December 31, 2019, we had $1,134.4 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments, comprised of $835.1 million of cash and cash equivalents, $289.7 million short-term investments and $9.6 million of restricted cash and investments. The Company only holds debt securities classified as available-for-sale. The fair value of cash equivalents and short-term investments is subject to change as a result of potential changes in market interest rates. The potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments has been assessed on a hypothetical 10 basis point adverse movement across all maturities. For both of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we estimate that such hypothetical adverse 10 basis point movement would result in a hypothetical loss in fair value of approximately $0.1 million, to our interest rate sensitive instruments. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The information required by this Item 8 begins on page F-1 in Item 15 of Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is incorporated into this item by reference. -74- Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Acc ountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. Disclosure Controls and Procedures We carried out an evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to paragraph (b) of Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Based on that review, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act (1) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and (2) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control procedure, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control procedure are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. We considered these limitations during the development of our disclosure controls and procedures, and will continually reevaluate them to ensure they provide reasonable assurance that such controls and procedures are effective. Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for our Company, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that: • pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; • provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and • provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in its 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on this assessment, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2019, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have not been material changes in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a–15(f) and 15d–15(f) under the Exchange Act for the quarter ended December 31, 2019 that our certifying officers concluded materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Page Number Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm F-2 Consolidated Balance Sheets F-4 Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss F-5 Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity F-6 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows F-7 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements F-8 F-1 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and Board of Directors Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc.: Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for leases as of January 1, 2019 due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) . Basis for Opinions The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. F-2 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgment. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Evaluation of lower of cost or net realizable value of raw materials inventory As described in Note 2 and Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, approximately 48%, or $82.0 million, of the Company’s total inventory balance is comprised of raw materials. The Company periodically analyzes its raw materials inventories, and writes down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value. We identified the evaluation of lower of cost or net realizable value of raw materials inventory as a critical audit matter. The estimate of expected future demand for raw materials inventory is difficult to assess and results in the application of greater auditor judgment. Specifically, challenging auditor judgment was required to assess the potential impact the Company’s gene therapy technologies and competitor RNA-targeted therapeutic or gene therapy products could have on existing raw materials inventory. The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company’s inventory valuation process, including controls related to the estimate of expected future demand for raw materials. We compared the Company’s prior period forecasted demand for raw materials to actual results to assess their ability to accurately estimate expected future demand. We evaluated clinical progress associated with the Company’s gene therapy technologies by inspecting internal meeting minutes and interviewing research and development personnel of the Company and assessed the potential impact of those technologies on expected future demand for raw materials inventory. We also read publicly available information to identify information regarding other competitor entities with RNA-targeted therapeutic or gene therapy products that could impact the Company’s estimates of expected future demand. /s/ KPMG LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002.

F-7 Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, “Sarepta” or the “Company”) is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on helping patients through the discovery and development of unique RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene therapy and other genetic therapeutic modalities for the treatment of rare diseases. Applying its proprietary, highly-differentiated and innovative technologies, and through collaborations with its strategic partners, the Company is developing potential therapeutic candidates for a broad range of diseases and disorders, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy (“DMD”), Limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (“LGMDs”), Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA (“MPS IIIA”) and other neuromuscular and central nervous system (“CNS”) disorders. Its first and second commercial products in the U.S., EXONDYS 51 (eteplirsen) Injection (“EXONDYS 51”) and VYONDYS 53 (golodirsen) Injection (“VYONDYS 53”), respectively, were granted accelerated approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) on September 19, 2016 and December 12, 2019, respectively. EXONDYS 51 and VYONDYS 53 are indicated for the treatment of DMD in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 51 and exon 53 skipping, respectively. EXONDYS 51 and VYONDYS 53 use the Company’s phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (“PMO”) chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 51 and exon 53, respectively, of the dystrophin gene. Exon skipping is intended to promote the production of an internally truncated but functional dystrophin protein. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had approximately $ 1,134.4 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments, consisting of $ 835.1 million of cash and cash equivalents, $ 289.7 million of short-term investments, and $ 9.6 million of restricted cash and investments. The Company believes that its balance of cash, cash equivalents and investments as of December 31, 2019 is sufficient to fund its current operational plan for at least the next twelve months, though it may pursue additional cash resources through public or private debt and equity financings, seek additional government contracts and establish collaborations with or license its technology to other companies. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”), reflect the accounts of Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions between and among its consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated. Management has determined that the Company operates in one segment: helping patients through the discovery and development of unique RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene therapy and other genetic therapeutic modalities for the treatment of rare diseases . The Company’s CEO, as the chief operating decision-maker, manages and allocates resources to the operations of the Company on a total company basis. The Company’s research and development organization is responsible for the research and discovery of new product candidates and supports development and registration efforts for potential future products. The Company’s supply chain organization manages the development of the manufacturing processes, clinical trial supply and commercial product supply. The Company’s commercial organization is responsible for commercialization of EXONDYS 51 and VYONDYS 53 in the U.S. and internationally. The Company is supported by other back-office general and administration functions. Consistent with this decision-making process, the Company’s CEO uses consolidated, single-segment financial information for purposes of evaluating performance, forecasting future period financial results, allocating resources and setting incentive targets. Estimates and Uncertainties The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. F-8 Fair Value Measurements The Company has certain financial assets that are recorded at fair value which have been classified as Level 1, 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy as described in the accounting standards for fair value measurements: • Level 1—quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; • Level 2—quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and • Level 3—valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant value drivers are unobservable. The fair value of the majority of the Company’s financial assets is categorized as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. These assets include money market funds, publicly traded debt, and equity securities. For additional information related to fair value measurements, please read Note 5, Fair Value Measurements to the consolidated financial statements. Cash Equivalents Only investments that are highly liquid and readily convertible to cash and have original maturities of three months or less are considered cash equivalents. Investments Available-For-Sale Debt Securities Available-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholder’s equity. Realized gains and losses are reported in other expense, net, on a specific identification basis. Equity Investments The Company’s equity investments include its investments in a publicly traded biotechnology company and a privately held biotechnology company and are included in other non-current assets in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The equity investment in the publicly traded biotechnology company has a readily determinable fair value and is carried at fair value with changes in value recorded as a gain or loss in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The equity investment in the privately held biotechnology company does not have readily determinable fair value and is measured at cost less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer, which is recorded as a gain or loss on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Accounts Receivable The Company’s accounts receivable primarily arise from product sales. They are generally stated at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Revenues from product sales are recorded at the net sales price (transaction price), which includes estimates of variable consideration for which reserves are established and which result from Medicaid rebates, governmental chargebacks including Public Health Services (“PHS”) chargebacks, prompt pay discounts, co-pay assistance and distribution fees. These reserves are based on the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if no payments are required of the Company) for PHS chargebacks, prompt pay discounts and certain distribution fees, or a current liability (if a payment is required of us), for Medicaid rebates, co-pay assistance and certain distribution fees. The accounts receivable from product sales represents receivables due from the Company’s specialty distributor and specialty pharmacies in the U.S. as well as certain distributors in the EU, Brazil, Israel and the Middle East. The Company monitors the financial performance and creditworthiness of its customers so that it can properly assess and respond to changes in the customers’ credit profiles. The Company provides reserves against trade receivables for estimated losses that may result from a customer’s inability to pay. Amounts determined to be uncollectible are written-off against the established reserve. As of December 31, 2019, the credit profiles for the Company’s customers are deemed to be in good standing and an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is not considered necessary. F-9 Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of accounts receivable from customers and cash, cash equivalent and investments held at financial institutions. For the year ended December 31, 2019 , the majority of the Company’s accounts receivable arose from product sales in the U.S. and all customers have standard payment terms which generally require payment within 60 to 91 days . Outside of the U.S., the payment terms range between 45 and 150 days . Three individual customers accounted for 43 %, 41 % and 13 % of net product revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019, 42 %, 38 % and 18 % for the year ended December 31, 2018, and 47 %, 34 % and 19 % for the year ended December 31, 2017. Three individual customers accounted for 45 %, 37 % and 11 % of accounts receivable from product sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 51 %, 28 % and 10 % for the year ended December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2019 , the Company believes that such customers are of high credit quality. As of December 31, 2019 , the Company’s cash equivalents and investments were concentrated at three financial institutions. The Company does not believe that there is significant risk of non-performance by the financial institutions. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. The Company capitalizes inventory costs associated with products following regulatory approval when future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized. EXONDYS 51 and VYONDYS 53 inventory that may be used in clinical development programs is charged to research and development expense when the product enters the research and development process and no longer can be used for commercial purposes. The Company periodically reviews its inventories for excess amounts or obsolescence and writes down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value. Additionally, though the Company’s product is subject to strict quality control and monitoring which it performs throughout the manufacturing processes, certain batches or units of product may not meet quality specifications resulting in a charge to cost of sales. For products which are under development and have not yet been approved by regulatory authorities, purchased drug product is charged to research and development expense upon delivery. Delivery occurs when the inventory passes quality inspection and ownership transfers to the Company. Nonrefundable advance payments for research and development activities, including production of purchased drug product, are deferred and capitalized until the goods are delivered. If the Company does not expect the goods to be delivered or services to be rendered, the advanced payment capitalized will be charged to expense. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are initially recorded at cost, including the acquisition cost and all costs necessarily incurred to bring the asset to the location and working condition necessary for its intended use. The cost of normal, recurring or periodic repairs and maintenance activities related to property and equipment are expensed as incurred. The cost for planned major maintenance activities, including the related acquisition or construction of assets, is capitalized if the repair will result in future economic benefits. Interest costs incurred during the construction period of major capital projects are capitalized until the asset is ready for its intended use, at which point the interest costs are amortized as depreciation expense over the life of the underlying asset. The Company generally depreciates the cost of its property and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which are summarized as follows: Asset Category Useful lives Lab equipment 5 years Office equipment 5 years Software and computer equipment 3 - 5 years Furniture and fixtures 7 years Leasehold improvements Lesser of the useful life or the term of the respective lease Land improvements 25 years Land Not depreciated Building and improvements 30 years Construction in Progress Not depreciated until put into service F-10 Intangible assets The Company’s intangible assets consist of in-licensed rights, patent costs, and software licenses, which are stated in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets net of accumulated amortization and impairments, if applicable. The in-licensed rights relate to agreements with BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. (“BioMarin”) and the University of Western Australia (“UWA”). The in-licensed rights are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the related patents because the life of the related patents reflects the expected time period that the Company will benefit from the in-licensed rights. Patent costs consist primarily of external legal costs, filing fees incurred to file patent applications and renewal fees on proprietary technology developed or licensed by the Company. Patent costs associated with applying for a patent, being issued a patent and annual renewal fees are capitalized. Costs to defend a patent and costs to invalidate a competitor’s patent or patent application are expensed as incurred. Patent costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated economic lives or the initial term of the patents, which is generally 20 years. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets held and used by the Company, intangible assets with definite lives and equity investments without a readily determinable fair value are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. The Company evaluates recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Such reviews assess the fair value of the assets based upon estimates of future cash flows that the assets are expected to generate. Convertible Debt The Company separately accounts for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments that can be settled in cash by allocating the proceeds from issuance between the liability component and the embedded conversion option. The value of the equity component is calculated by first measuring the fair value of the liability component, using the interest rate of a similar liability that does not have a conversion feature, as of the issuance date. The difference between the proceeds from the convertible debt issuance and the amount measured as the liability component is recorded as the equity component with a corresponding discount recorded on the debt. The Company recognizes the amortization of the resulting discount as interest expense using the effective interest method. Simultaneously, the Company bought capped call options from certain counterparties to minimize the impact of potential dilution upon conversion. The premium for the capped call options was recorded as additional paid-in capital. For additional information related to the convertible debt transactions, please read Note 13, Indebtedness to the consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for the goods or services provided. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements within the scope of ASC Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASC Topic 606”), the Company performs the following five steps: (1) identify the contract with the customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers or provides to the customer. At contract inception, the Company assesses the goods or services promised within each contract and determines those that are performance obligations, and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. The Company then recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when or as the performance obligation is satisfied. The only performance obligation in the Company’s contracts with customers is to timely deliver drug products to the customer’s designated location. Product revenues The Company distributes its products principally through its customers. The customers subsequently resell the product to patients and health care providers. The Company provides no right of return to the customers except in cases of shipping error or product defect. Product revenues are recognized when the customers take control of the product, which typically occurs upon delivery to the customers. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 , the majority of the revenues recognized were generated by the specialty distributor and specialty pharmacies in the U.S. F-11 Variable Consideration Product revenues are recorded at the net sales price (transaction price) which includes estimated reserves for variable consideration, such as Medicaid rebates, governmental chargebacks, including Public Health Service (“PHS”) chargebacks, prompt payment discounts, co-pay assistance and distribution fees. These reserves reflect the Company’s best estimates of the amount of consideration to which it is entitled based on the terms of the contracts. Additional details relating to variable consideration follows: • Medicaid rebates relate to the Company’s estimated obligations to states under established reimbursement arrangements. Medicaid rebate reserves are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a liability which is included in accrued expenses. • Governmental chargebacks, including PHS chargebacks, relate to the Company’s estimated obligations resulting from contractual commitments to sell products to qualified healthcare providers at prices lower than the list prices that the Company charges to wholesalers. The wholesaler charges the Company for the difference between what the wholesaler pays for the products and the ultimate selling price to the qualified healthcare providers. Chargeback reserves are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and accounts receivable. Chargeback amounts are generally determined at the time of resale to the qualified healthcare provider from the wholesaler, and the Company generally issues credits for such amounts within a few weeks of receiving notification of resale from the wholesaler. • Prompt payment discounts relate to the Company’s estimated obligations for credits to be granted to specialty pharmacies for remitting payment on their purchases within established incentive periods. Reserves for prompt payment discounts are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and accounts receivable. • Co-pay assistance relates to financial assistance provided to qualified patients, whereby the Company may assist them with prescription drug co-payments required by the patient’s insurance provider. Reserves for co-pay assistance are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a liability which is included in accrued expenses. • Distribution fees relate to fees paid to customers in the distribution channel that provide the Company with inventory management, data and distribution services and are generally accounted for as a reduction of revenue. To the extent that the services received are distinct from the Company’s sale of products to the customers, these payments are accounted for as selling, general and administrative expenses. Reserves for distribution fees result in an increase in a liability if payments are required of the Company or a reduction of accounts receivable if no payments are required of the Company. Research and Development Research and development expenses consist of costs associated with research activities as well as those with the Company’s product development efforts, conducting pre-clinical trials, clinical trials and manufacturing activities. Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred. Up-front fees and milestones paid to third parties in connection with technologies which have not reached technological feasibility and do not have an alternative future use are expensed when incurred. Direct research and development expenses associated with the Company’s programs include clinical trial site costs, clinical manufacturing costs, costs incurred for consultants and other external services, such as data management and statistical analysis support and materials and supplies used in support of clinical programs. Indirect costs of the Company’s clinical programs include salaries, stock-based compensation and an allocation of its facility and technology costs. When third-party service providers’ billing terms do not coincide with the Company’s period-end, the Company is required to make estimates of its obligations to those third parties, including clinical trial and pharmaceutical development costs, contractual services costs and costs for supply of its drug candidates, incurred in a given accounting period and record accruals at the end of the period. The Company bases its estimates on its knowledge of the research and development programs, services performed for the period, past history for related activities and the expected duration of the third-party service contract, where applicable. Stock-Based Compensation The Company’s stock-based compensation programs include stock options, restricted stock awards (“RSAs”), restricted stock units (“RSUs”), stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) and an employee stock purchase program (“ESPP”). The Company accounts for stock-based compensation using the fair value method. F-12 The fair values of stock options and SARs are estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The fair values of RSAs and RSUs are based on the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant. The fair value of stock awards, with consideration given to estimated forfeitures, is recognized as stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the grants. For stock awards with performance-vesting conditions, the Company does not recognize compensation expense until it is probable that the performance-vesting condition will be achieved. Under the Company’s ESPP, participating employees purchase common stock through payroll deductions. The purchase price is equal to 85 % of the lower of the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the first business day and the last business day of the relevant purchase period. The fair value of stock purchase rights are estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The fair value of the look-back provision with the 15 % discount is recognized on a graded-vesting basis as stock-based compensation expense over the purchase period. In addition to stock options with service and performance conditions, the Company also granted its CEO options with service and market conditions. A market condition relates to the achievement of a specified price of the Company’s common stock, a specified amount of intrinsic value indexed to the Company’s common stock or a specified price of the Company’s common stock in terms of other similar equity shares. The grant date fair value for the options with service and market conditions is determined by a lattice model with Monte Carlo simulations and is recognized as stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period. Income Taxes The Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. It is the intention of the Company to reinvest the earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries in those operations and not to repatriate the earnings to the U.S. Accordingly, the Company does not provide for deferred taxes on the excess of the financial reporting over the tax basis in its investments in foreign subsidiaries as they are considered permanent in duration. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered and settled. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the net deferred tax asset to zero when it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon an examination. Leases Effective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASC Topic 842, “ Leases” (“ASC 842”), using the modified retrospective approach and utilizing the effective date as its date of initial application, for which prior periods are presented in accordance with the previous guidance in ASC Topic 840, “ Leases” (“ASC 840”). As a result of adopting ASC 842, the Company recorded lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets of $ 42.5 million and lease liabilities of $ 60.1 million as of January 1, 2019, primarily related to real estate leases, based on the present value of future lease payments on the date of adoption. The difference between the ROU assets and lease liabilities was due to previously recorded net deferred rent liabilities that were reclassified into the ROU assets. There was no impact to retained earnings upon adoption of ASC 842. Amounts related to finance leases were immaterial as of adoption . At the inception of an arrangement, the Company determines whether the arrangement is or contains a lease based on the unique facts and circumstances present in the arrangement. Leases with a term greater than 12 months are recognized on the balance sheet as ROU assets and short-term and long-term lease liabilities, as applicable. The Company has elected not to recognize on the balance sheet leases with terms of 12 months or less. The Company typically only includes an initial lease term in its assessment of a lease arrangement. Options to renew a lease are not included in the Company’s assessment unless there is reasonable certainty that the Company will renew. The Company monitors its plans to renew its leases no less than on a quarterly basis. In addition, the Company’s lease agreements generally do not contain any residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants. Operating lease liabilities and their corresponding ROU assets are recorded based on the present value of future lease payments over the expected remaining lease term at lease commencement. Lease cost for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term as an operating expense. Certain adjustments to the ROU asset may be required for items such as lease prepayments or incentives received. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable. As a result, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate, which reflects the fixed rate at which the Company could borrow on a collateralized basis the amount of the lease payments in the same currency, for a similar term, in a similar economic environment. In transition to ASC 842, the Company utilized the remaining lease term of its leases in determining the appropriate incremental borrowing rate. F-13 In accordance with ASC 842, components of a lease should be bifurcated between lease components and non - lease components. The fixed and in-substance fixed contract consideration identified must then be allocated based on the respective relative fair values to the lease components and non - lease components. However, ASC 842 provides a practical expedient that allows an accounting policy election to not separate lease and non - lease components by class of underlying asset. In using this expedient, the lease component and non - lease component s are accounted for together as a single component. For real estate leases, the Company has elected to account for the lease and non - lease components together for existing classes of underlying assets and allocates the contract consideration to the lease component only . This practical expedient is not elected for manufacturing facilities and equipment embedded in product supply arrangements. Embedded Derivatives The Company evaluates certain of its financial and business development transactions to determine if embedded components of these contracts meet the definition of derivative under Topic ASC 815, “ Derivatives and Hedging ”. In general, embedded derivatives are required to be bifurcated from the host instrument if (i) the embedded feature is not clearly and closely related to the host contract and (ii) the embedded feature, if considered a freestanding instrument, met the definition of a derivative. The embedded derivative is reported on the balance sheets at its fair value. Any change in fair value, as determined at each measurement period, is recorded as a component of the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Commitments and Contingencies The Company records liabilities for legal and other contingencies when information available to the Company indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Legal costs in connection with legal and other contingencies are expensed as costs are incurred. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2019-12, “ Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes”, which is intended to simplify the accounting for income taxes. This ASU removes certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and also clarifies and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. The new standard will be effective beginning January 1, 2021. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact this ASU may have on its financial position and results of operations upon adoption. In November 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-18, “ Collaborative Arrangements (Topic 808): Clarifying the Interaction between Topic 808 and Topic 606 ”. The amendments in this update clarifies that certain transactions between collaborative arrangement participants should be accounted for as revenue when the collaborative arrangement participant is a customer in the context of a unit of account and precludes recognizing as revenue consideration received from a collaborative arrangement participant if the participant is not a customer. The new standard will be effective beginning January 1, 2020 and early adoption is permitted. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has elected to early adopt this ASU and the adoption did not have a material impact on its financial position and results of operations. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820), Disclosure Framework – Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement”. This ASU removed the following disclosure requirements: (1) the amount of and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy; (2) the policy for timing of transfers between levels; and (3) the valuation processes for Level 3 fair value measurements. Additionally, this update added the following disclosure requirements: (1) the changes in unrealized gains and losses for the period included in other comprehensive income and loss for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements held at the end of the reporting period; (2) the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements. For certain unobservable inputs, an entity may disclose other quantitative information (such as the median or arithmetic average) in lieu of the weighted average if the entity determines that other quantitative information would be a more reasonable and rational method to reflect the distribution of unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements. ASU No. 2018-13 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 with early adoption permitted. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has not elected to early adopt this guidance but does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, “ Intangibles – Goodwill and Other – Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That is a Service Contract”. This ASU requires a customer in a cloud computing arrangement (i.e., hosting arrangement) that is a service contract to follow the internal-use software guidance contained in ASC Subtopic 350-40 to determine which implementation costs to capitalize as assets or expense as incurred. Capitalized implementation costs related to a hosting arrangement that is a service contract will be amortized over the term of the hosting arrangement, beginning when the module or component of the hosting arrangement is ready for its intended use. ASU No. 2018-15 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has not elected to early adopt this guidance but believes that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. F-14 In June 2016 , the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, “ Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ” . This ASU requires that credit losses be reported using an expected losses model rather than the incurred losses model that is currently used, and establishes additional disclosures related to credit risks. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, this standard now requires allowances to be recorded instead of reducing the amortized cost of the investment. ASU 2016-13 limits the amount of credit losses to be recognized for available-for-sale debt securities to the amount by which carrying value exceeds fair value and requires the reversal of previously recognized credit losses if fair value increases. ASU 2016-13 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 with early adoption permitted , and requires adoption using a modified retrospective approach, with certain exceptions. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has not elected to early adopt this guidance. Based on the composition of the Company’s investment portfolio as of December 3 1 , 2019, current market conditions and historical credit loss activity, the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Additionally, for trade receivables, due to their short duration and the credit profile of the Company’s customers, the effect of transitioning from the incurred losses model to the expected losses model is not expected to be material. 3. LICENSE AND COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS Roche Holding A.G. On December 21, 2019, the Company entered into a license, collaboration and option agreement and a stock purchase agreement (collectively, the “Roche Agreements”) with F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd (“Roche”), providing Roche with exclusive commercial rights to SRP-9001 (AAVrh74.MHCK7.micro-dystrophin) (the “Lead Product”), the Company’s investigational gene therapy for DMD, outside the U.S. The Company retains all rights to SRP-9001 in the U.S. and will perform all development activities directed to obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for SRP-9001 in the U.S. and the EU. Further, global development expenses for SRP-9001 will be equally shared between the two parties. The closing of the transaction was subject to the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and other customary conditions. The agreement became effective as of February 4, 2020, and closed on February 14, 2020. When the Roche Agreements became effective, the Company received payments totaling approximately $ 1.2 billion, consisting of $ 750.0 million in an up-front payment and $ 400.0 million in an equity investment. Additionally, the Company may receive up to approximately $ 1.7 billion in regulatory and sales milestones related to the Lead Product. Upon commercialization, the Company is also eligible to receive tiered royalty payments based on net sales. In addition, Roche has options to in-license (1) certain exon-skipping products that target the dystrophin gene to induce exon skipping, including eteplirsen, golodirsen, casimersen and SRP-5051, (2) certain gene therapy products other than SRP-9001 that encode and directly express dystrophin or a derivative thereof and (3) certain gene-editing products that modify, repair, or activate an endogenous dysfunctional dystrophin gene (collectively, the “Option Products”). If and when Roche decides to exercise the options, it will be required to make an option exercise payment, on a per Option Product basis, in an amount ranging between $ 20.0 million and $ 125.0 million. As of December 31, 2019, there was no accounting impact as a result of the execution of the Roche Agreements because the closing of the transaction did not occur until subsequent to year-end. Genethon In May 2017, the Company entered into a sponsored research agreement (the “Research Agreement”) with Genethon for its micro-dystrophin gene therapy program for the treatment of DMD. The Research Agreement provided the Company with an option to in-license the corresponding technology. On November 22, 2019, the Company exercised the option and entered into a license and collaboration with Genethon (the “Genethon Collaboration Agreement”). The Genethon Collaboration Agreement grants the Company with exclusive rights in the majority of the world (primarily excluding the EU) to Genethon’s micro-dystrophin gene therapy products (“Genethon Products”) and other micro-dystrophin gene therapy products (“Other Licensed Products”). Under the Genethon Collaboration Agreement, a joint steering committee will be established to plan, monitor and coordinate development activities for Genethon Products and Other Licensed Products. The Company and Genethon will be responsible for 75 % and 25 %, respectively, of development costs related to both the Genethon Products and the Other Licensed Products. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded $ 9.0 million of research and development expense related to reimbursable development costs incurred for Genethon Products to date. F-15 Upon exercise of the option, the Company made an up-front payment of $ 28.0 million and may be liable for up to $ 157.5 million and $ 78.8 million in development, regulatory and sales milestones for the Genethon Products and Other Licensed Products, respectively. Furthermore, upon commercialization, the Company will be required to make tiered royalty payments based on net sales of the Genethon Products and the Other Licensed Products. The up-front payment represents rights to potential future benefits associated with ongoing research and development activities that have no alternative future use. Accordingly, this amount has been recorded as research and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, no development or regulatory milestones were deemed probable of being achieved and, accordingly, no additional expense has been recognized. StrideBio, Inc. On November 14, 2019 (the “StrideBio Effective Date”), the Company entered into a collaboration and license agreement (the “StrideBio Collaboration Agreement”) and a stock purchase agreement (collectively, the “StrideBio Agreements”) with StrideBio, Inc. (“StrideBio”). Under the terms of the StrideBio Collaboration Agreement, StrideBio granted the Company exclusive worldwide licenses to develop, collaborate and commercialize StrideBio’s adeno-associated viral capsids for gene therapy with respect to multiple initial development targets (“Initial Targets”), and, at the option of the Company, additional development targets (“Additional Targets”). The Company also may be required to participate in StrideBio’s next preferred equity round of financing, subject to certain conditions. Both the Initial Targets and the Additional Targets are comprised of targets to which the Company will have the exclusive right to perform development activities (“Sarepta Development Targets”) and targets that the two parties will jointly develop through completion of Phase 1/2 clinical trials (“Joint Development Targets”). The Company also has the right to select additional Sarepta Development Targets and Joint Development Targets. For each Sarepta Development Target, StrideBio is responsible for initial research activities and each party bears its own costs while the Company is responsible for all costs following transfer of responsibilities to the Company for additional development. For each Joint Development Target, the parties will be responsible to develop a joint development plan for which the parties will share equally all costs through Phase 1/2 of clinical trials after which the Company will be solely responsible for the continued development, regulatory approval and commercialization of the target, including all related costs. The Company and StrideBio will also form a joint steering committee to oversee the collaboration activities. As a result of execution of the StrideBio Agreements, the Company recognized an up-front expense of $ 46.9 million, consisting of a cash payment of $ 17.5 million and 301,980 shares of the Company’s common stock delivered to StrideBio equal to $ 29.4 million. For Sarepta Development Targets and Joint Development Targets, respectively, the Company may be liable for up to $ 450.0 million and $ 835.0 million in development, regulatory and sales milestone payments per target. Furthermore, the Company may be obligated to pay StrideBio up to $ 42.5 million in additional fees when and if Additional Targets are selected. Additionally, upon commercialization, the Company may be required to make tiered royalty payments based on net sales of each target. The total up-front payment of $ 46.9 million, representing the fair value of the common shares delivered and cash, represents rights to potential future benefits associated with ongoing research and development activities that have no alternative future use. Accordingly, this amount has been recorded as research and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, no development or regulatory milestones were deemed probable of being achieved and, accordingly, no additional expense has been recognized. Myonexus Therapeutics In May 2018, the Company entered into a Warrant to Purchase Common Stock Agreement (“Warrant Agreement”) with Myonexus Therapeutics, Inc. (“Myonexus”), a clinical-stage gene therapy biotechnology company that was developing gene therapies for Limb-Girdle muscular dystrophies (“LGMD”). Pursuant to the terms of the Warrant Agreement, the Company made an up-front payment of $ 60.0 million to purchase an exclusive option to acquire Myonexus for $ 200.0 million plus sales-related and regulatory-related contingent payments. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded $ 85.0 million to research and development expense in connection with the Warrant Agreement comprised of the $ 60.0 million up-front payment, two development milestone payments totaling $ 20.0 million, and a third development milestone for $ 5.0 million was deemed probable of being achieved as of December 31, 2018. On February 27, 2019, the Company announced that it exercised the exclusive option to acquire Myonexus. The final exercise price as negotiated between the Company and Myonexus was $ 165.0 million. In addition, the Company incurred transaction fees and other fees associated with the exercise of approximately $ 8.8 million. The Company may also be required to make up to $ 200.0 million in additional payments to selling shareholders of Myonexus based on the achievement of certain sales- and regulatory-related milestones. The acquisition closed on April 4, 2019 . F-16 As a result of the acquisition, the Company added five LGMD gene therapy programs, including MYO-101, MYO-102 and MYO-201 that are currently in Phase 1/2 clinical trials, to its research and development portfolio. The acquisition of Myonexus has been accounted for as an asset acquisition as substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a group of similar identifiable assets (the five LGMD gene therapy programs). Additionally, the Company assessed whether any of the contingent payments met the definition of a derivative under ASC 815 and, therefore, should be accounted for as contingent consideration. The Company identified that one regulatory-related milestone (not solely based on drug approval by the FDA) met the definition of a derivative. As a result, the Company recorded a contingent consideration liability of $ 4.5 million at the acquisition date. Any changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability after the acquisition date is included in the Company’s statement of operations. This amount was estimated through a probability-weighted expected return method that incorporated industry-based probability adjusted assumptions relating to the achievement of the milestone and thus the likelihood of making the payments. This fair value measurement was based upon significant inputs not observable in the market and therefore represented a Level 3 fair value measurement. The Company did not assume any other liabilities as a result of the acquisition. The following table summarizes the total consideration for the asset acquisition and the value of assets acquired and liability assumed: Consideration (in thousands) Purchase price $ 165,000 Transactions costs and other fees 8,753 Contingent consideration 4,500 Total consideration $ 178,253 Assets Acquired (in thousands) Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,197 Prepaids 3,816 In-process research and development 173,240 Total assets acquired $ 178,253 Liability Assumed (in thousands) Contingent consideration 4,500 Total liability assumed $ 4,500 The acquired in-process research and development asset relates to the LGMD asset group. Due to the stage of development of this asset group, significant risk remains, and it is not yet probable that there is future economic benefit from this asset. Absent successful clinical results and regulatory approval, there is no alternative future use associated with the LGMD asset group. Accordingly, the value of this asset of $ 173.2 million was immediately expensed to research and development expense during the three months ended June 30, 2019. The portion of the $ 200.0 million in contingent payments related to the sales milestone will be accrued when and if the sales milestone becomes probable of being achieved, and the related payment will be capitalized and amortized over the life of the patent. As of December 31, 2019, the sales milestone was not probable of being achieved. Lysogene S.A. In October 2018, the Company entered into a license and collaboration agreement to develop and commercialize LYS-SAF302, a gene therapy to treat MPS IIIA as well as an equity investment agreement with Lysogene S.A. (“Lysogene”). Under the license and collaboration agreement, in addition to the payment of up-front fees, the Company may be liable for a total of $ 102.8 million in development, regulatory and sales milestones. Furthermore, the Company may be required to make tiered royalty payments based on net sales of the LYS-SAF302 product subsequent to its commercialization. Under the equity investment agreement, the Company purchased 950,606 shares of common stock issued by Lysogene, representing 8 % of the outstanding equity of Lysogene at the time of the transaction. F-17 As a result of execution of the agreements, for the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded research and development expense of $ 44.8 million, consisting of $ 26.1 million related to the payment of up-front fees and $ 18.7 million related to the achievement of a development milestone. In addition, $ 1.9 million of the total up-front fees paid was allocated to the equity investment in Lysogene and recorded as an other non-current asset. Changes in the fair value of this equity investment are recorded to other (loss) income in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive loss. As of December 31, 2019, no additional development or regulatory milestones were deemed probable of being achieved and, accordingly, no additional expense has been recognized. Further, t he changes in the fair value of the equity investment for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were not material. Lacerta Therapeutics In August 2018, the Company entered into a license, development and option agreement (the “Lacerta License Agreement”) and a Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”) with Lacerta Therapeutics, Inc. (“Lacerta”). Pursuant to the Lacerta License Agreement, the Company licensed exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize a pre-clinical Pompe product candidate (the “Pompe License”). Lacerta also granted the Company exclusive options to enter into exclusive license agreements to develop, manufacture and commercialize other gene therapy product candidates for Sanfilipo syndrome and L-Amino Acid Decarboxylase Deficiency for additional consideration of $ 42.0 million (collectively, the “Options”) when (and if) the Options are exercised. Additionally, the Company may be liable for up to approximately $ 44.0 million in development, regulatory and sales milestones associated with the Pompe License and may be required to make tiered royalty payments based on net sales of the Pompe product subsequent to its commercialization. Under the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company purchased approximately 4.5 million shares of Series A preferred stock issued by Lacerta. Under the agreements, the Company made an up-front payment of $ 38.0 million to Lacerta, $ 30.0 million and $ 8.0 million of which were allocated to the Series A preferred stock investment and the Pompe License, respectively. The amount allocated to the Pompe License represents rights to potential future benefits associated with ongoing research and development activities that have no alternative future use. Accordingly, this amount was recorded as research and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2019, no development or regulatory milestones were deemed probable of being achieved and, accordingly, no additional expense has been recognized. The $30.0 million allocated to the Series A preferred stock investment was initially measured at cost and is classified as an other non-current asset in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the carrying value of the investment are reported as a component of earnings whenever there are observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of Lacerta in the future. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company did no t record any changes in carrying value of the investment as Lacerta did not issue identical or similar shares during the corresponding periods. Nationwide Children’s Hospital In December 2016, the Company entered into an exclusive option agreement with Nationwide Children’s Hospital (“Nationwide”) from which the Company obtained an exclusive right to acquire a worldwide license of the micro-dystrophin gene therapy technology for DMD and Becker muscular dystrophy. In October 2018, the Company exercised the option and entered into a license agreement with Nationwide (“Nationwide License Agreement”). Pursuant to the Nationwide License Agreement, the Company licensed exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize micro-dystrophin gene therapy product candidates. Under the agreement, the Company made an up-front payment of $ 1.0 million to Nationwide, which was recorded as research and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2018. Additionally, the Company may be required to make up to $ 29.0 million in development, regulatory and sales milestone payments per micro-dystrophin product and low-single-digit royalty payments based on net sales of the micro-dystrophin products upon commercialization. As of December 31, 2019, no development or regulatory milestones were deemed probable of being achieved and, accordingly, no additional expense has been recognized. BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. In July 2017, the Company and the University of Western Australia (“UWA”) entered into a settlement agreement with BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. (“BioMarin”). On the same day, the Company entered into a license agreement, which was subsequently amended in April 2019, with BioMarin and Academisch Ziekenhuis Leiden (“AZL”) (collectively with the Company, UWA and BioMarin, the “Settlement Parties”). Under these agreements and amendment, BioMarin agreed to provide the Company with an exclusive license to certain intellectual property with an option to convert the exclusive license into a co-exclusive license and the Settlement Parties agreed to stop most existing efforts to continue with ongoing litigation and opposition and other administrative proceedings concerning BioMarin’s intellectual property. As a result of execution of the agreements, the Company made total up-front payments of $ 35.0 million. Additionally, the Company may be liable for up to approximately $ 65.0 million in regulatory and sales milestones for eteplirsen as well as casimersen and golodirsen. BioMarin is also eligible to receive tiered royalty payments, ranging from 4 % to 8 %, based on the net sales for the two products and product candidate. The royalty terms under the license agreement will expire in March 2024 in the U.S., December 2024 in the EU and no later than December 2024 in other countries. F-18 Of the $35.0 million paid to BioMarin, $ 28.4 million was expensed as incurred and $ 6.6 million was recorded as an intangible asset, representing the fair value of the U.S. license to BioMarin’s intellectual property. The intangible asset is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the patent and has a carrying value of $ 4.2 million as of December 31, 2019. The FDA approval of VYONDYS 53 in December 2019 resulted in a settlement charge to BioMarin of $ 10.0 million and has been expensed as incurred. No regulatory or sales milestones were achieved for the years ended December 31, 2018 or 2017. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized royalty expense of $ 19.4 million, $ 15.1 million and $ 4.7 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, no other regulatory or sales milestones were deemed probable of being achieved and, accordingly, no additional in-licensed rights or expenses have been recognized. University of Western Australia In April 2013, the Company and UWA entered into an amendment to an existing exclusive license agreement relating to the treatment of DMD by inducing the skipping of certain exons. The agreement was further amended in June 2016. Under the amended agreement, the Company may be obligated to make payments to UWA totaling up to $ 26.0 million upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and sales milestones. Additionally, the Company is required to pay a low-single-digit percentage royalty on net sales of products covered by issued patents licensed under the agreements with UWA. Corresponding with the FDA approval of EXONDYS 51 in 2016, the Company recorded a $ 1.0 million milestone payment as an in-licensed right intangible asset in its consolidated balance sheet. Similarly, corresponding to the milestone payments associated with the FDA approval of VYONDYS 53 in December 2019, the Company recorded a $ 0.5 million milestone payment as an in-licensed right intangible asset in its consolidated balance sheet. Both intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the relevant patents and have a combined carrying value of $ 1.1 million as of December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded $ 3.5 million in royalty expense, which is included in cost of sales, related to agreements with UWA with no such an expense incurred in 2018 or 2017. As of December 31, 2019, no other development, regulatory or sales milestones were deemed probable of being achieved and, accordingly, no additional in-licensed rights or expenses have been recognized. Milestone Obligations As of December 31, 2019, the Company may be obligated to make up to $ 3.0 billion of future development, regulatory, commercial, and up-front royalty payments associated with its collaboration and license agreements. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized approximately $ 113.2 million, $ 142.4 million and $ 22.0 million relating to certain up-front, milestone and settlement payments as research and development expense, respectively, under these agreements. The Company is also obligated to pay royalties on net sales of certain of its products related to these collaboration and license agreements. The royalty rates range from the low-single-digit to high teens percentages for both inside and outside the U.S. 4.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The tables below present information about the Company’s financial assets that are measured and carried at fair value and indicate the level within the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques it utilizes to determine such fair value: Fair Value Measurement as of December 31, 2019 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 (in thousands) Assets Money market funds $ 203,410 $ 203,410 $ — $ — Government and government agency bonds 809,159 809,159 — — Strategic equity investments 31,937 1,937 — 30,000 Certificates of deposit 1,001 1,001 — — Total assets $ 1,045,507 $ 1,015,507 $ — $ 30,000 Liabilities Contingent consideration 5,200 — — 5,200 Total liabilities $ 5,200 $ — $ — $ 5,200 Fair Value Measurement as of December 31, 2018 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 (in thousands) Assets Money market funds $ 42,920 $ 42,920 $ — $ — Commercial paper 125,907 — 125,907 — Government and government agency bonds 760,235 760,235 — — Corporate bonds 43,468 43,468 — — Strategic equity investments 31,739 1,739 — 30,000 Certificates of deposit 1,001 1,001 — — Total $ 1,005,270 $ 849,363 $ 125,907 $ 30,000 The Company’s assets with fair value categorized as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy include money market funds, government and government agency bonds, corporate bonds, certificates of deposit, and the Company’s strategic investment in Lysogene, a publicly traded company in France, as more fully described in Note 3, License and Collaboration Agreements . Certain of the government and government agency bonds and corporate bonds are publicly traded fixed income securities and are presented as cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s assets with fair value categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy consist of commercial paper and government and government agency bonds. These assets have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued, at the end of each reporting period, through income-based approaches utilizing market observable data. The Company’s assets with fair value categorized as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy consists of a strategic investment in Series A preferred stock of Lacerta as more fully described in Note 3, License and Collaboration Agreements . The fair value of the asset was initially based on a cost approach corroborated by the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The most significant assumptions in the option pricing model include historical volatility of similar public companies, estimated term through Lacerta’s potential exit and a risk-free rate based on certain U.S. Treasury rates. At the end of each reporting period, the fair value will be adjusted if Lacerta issues similar or identical equity securities or when there is a triggering event for impairment. There were no changes in the fair value of the Lacerta strategic investment during the year ended December 31, 2019. The Company’s contingent consideration liability with fair value categorized as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy relate to the regulatory-related contingent payments to Myonexus selling shareholders as well as to an academic institution under a separate license agreement that meet the definition on a derivative. For more information related to Myonexus, please read Note 3, License and Collaboration Agreements . This amount was estimated through an income approach based on the probability-weighted expected cash flows that incorporated industry-based probability adjusted assumptions relating to the achievement of the milestone and thus the likelihood of making the payments. This fair value measurement was based upon significant inputs not observable in the market and therefore represented a Level 3 measurement. At the end of each reporting period, the fair value is adjusted to reflect the most current assumptions through earnings. There were no changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration during the year ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, the contingent consideration was recorded as a non-current liability on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. F-20 The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equiva lents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments.

For more information about the in-licensed rights, please read Note 3, License and Collaboration Agreements . For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded $ 0.8 million, $ 0.9 million and $ 1.1 million, respectively, of amortization related to the in-license rights.

INDEBTEDNESS 2024 Convertible Notes On November 14, 2017, the Company issued $ 570.0 million senior notes due on November 15, 2024 (the “2024 Notes”). The 2024 Notes were issued at face value and bear interest at the rate of 1.50 % per annum, payable semi-annually in cash on each May 15 and November 15, commencing on May 15, 2018. The 2024 Notes contain customary covenants and events of default, occurrence of which will permits the certain holders to accelerate all outstanding obligations, including principal and interest. Upon conversion, the Company may pay cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and stock, as determined by the Company in its discretion. The 2024 Notes may be convertible into 7,763,552 shares of the Company’s common stock under certain circumstances prior to maturity at a conversion rate of 13.621 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the 2024 Notes, which represents a conversion price of $ 73.42 per share, subject to adjustment under certain conditions. The Company allocated the proceeds received from issuance of the 2024 Notes between the liability component and the embedded conversion option, or equity component. The liability component was determined by measuring the fair value of similar notes that do not include the embedded conversion option. The Company allocated $ 161.1 million to the equity component, which was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the 2024 Notes. The equity component, net of allocated offering costs of $ 4.2 million, was recorded as an increase additional paid-in capital. The equity component, plus $ 10.6 million of offering costs allocated to the liability component, represent the total debt discount on the 2024 Notes at issuance. The debt discount is amortized under the effective interest method and recorded as additional interest expense over the life of the 2024 Notes. The effective interest rate on the liability component of the 2024 Notes for the year ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was 6.9 %. Upon the occurrence of a “fundamental change”, which includes (1) change in beneficial ownership of the Company where any person/group possesses more than 50 % of the voting power of the Company, (2) consolidation or merger of the Company, (3) shareholder approval of a liquidation plan or (4) the Company is delisted from NYSE or NASDAQ, the holders may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the 2024 Notes for cash at 100 % of the principal amount of the 2024 Notes being purchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. Additionally, upon the occurrence of a “make-whole fundamental change” prior to the maturity date, the Company shall adjust the conversion rate on a sliding scale basis detailed in the agreement To minimize the impact of potential dilution upon conversion of the 2024 Notes, the Company separately entered into capped call transactions with certain counterparties. The capped calls have a strike price of $ 73.42 and a cap price of $ 104.88 and are exercisable when and if the 2024 Notes are converted. If, upon conversion of the 2024 Notes, the price of the Company’s common stock is between the strike price and the cap price of the capped calls, the counterparties will deliver shares of the Company’s common stock and/or cash with an aggregate value equal to the difference between the price of the Company’s common stock at the conversion date and the strike price, multiplied by the number of shares of the Company’s common stock related to the capped calls being exercised. The Company paid $ 50.9 million for these capped calls transactions, which was recorded as additional paid-in capital. F-25 Term Loan s and Revolving Line of Credit December 2019 Term Loan On December 13, 2019, the Company entered into a loan agreement (the “Loan Agreement”) which provides a term loan (“December 2019 Term Loan”) of $ 500.0 million with Biopharma Credit PLC and Biopharma Credit Investments V (Master) LP (collectively, the “Lenders”). The 2019 Term Loan has two tranches: A and B, each of which has a loan amount of $ 250.0 million. On December 20, 2019, Sarepta drew down tranche A of the 2019 Term Loan and has the option of draw down tranche B of the loan no later than December 31, 2020, subject to certain conditions. The December 2019 Term Loan matures on December 20, 2023 , when the principal amount of the loan will become due. Borrowings under the Loan Agreement bore interest at a rate per annum equal to 8.5 %, which shall be payable quarterly in arrears. The Company is also required to pay the Lenders (1) a fee of 1.75 % of the amounts drawn under both tranche A and tranche B due on closing (if and when drawn down), (2) a fee of 2.0 % of principal amount on the December 2019 Term Loan maturity date or prepayment amount on each prepayment date and (3) certain out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Lenders. The Company may voluntarily prepay, in whole or in part, the outstanding balance under the December 2019 Term Loan at any time after the tranche A closing date. Upon occurrence of a change in control, the Company is required to repay any amounts outstanding under the December 2019 Term Loan. In the event of a permitted prepayment, the Company would be obligated to make the following premium payments: (1) an amount equal to the sum of all interest that would have been accrued and payable from the prepayment date through December 20, 2021 (“Makewhole Amount”), and (2) an amount equal to 1.0 % to 2.0 % of the prepayment amount depending on the date of the prepayment (“Prepayment Premium”). The Loan Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants as well as events of default, the occurrence of which would permit the Lenders to accelerate the payment of all outstanding obligations, including the payment of the Makewhole Amount and Prepayment Premium. As of December 31, 2019, the Company recorded a debt discount of $ 9.4 million and debt issuance costs of $ 0.7 million, both of which are being treated as deduction to the carrying value of the December 2019 Term Loan and amortized as interest expense over the term of the loan based on an effective interest method. The debt discount of $9.4 million is inclusive of (1) the initial fee of 1.75 % payable to the Lenders and (2) the 2.0 % fee payable to the Lenders at maturity or prepayment of the December 2019 Term Loan. This amount is recorded within other long-term liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. After certain debt discounts and debt issuance costs, the Company received net proceeds of $ 244.9 million. July 2017 Term Loan and Revolving Line of Credit In July 2017, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the “Amended and Restated Credit and Security Agreement”) with MidCap Financial Trust (“MidCap”) which provided a term loan of $ 60.0 million, bearing interest at a rate of 6.25 %, plus the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). In addition, in July 2017, the Company entered into a revolving credit and security agreement (the “Revolving Credit Agreement”) with MidCap which provided an aggregate revolving loan commitment of $ 40.0 million, bearing interest at a rate of 3.95 %, plus the one-month LIBOR. In September 2018, the Company terminated both the Amended and Restated Credit and Security Agreement and the Revolving Credit Agreement with MidCap and paid off all amounts due thereunder, including any accrued and unpaid interest. As a result, the Company recorded a debt extinguishment loss of $ 2.3 million primarily related to the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and prepayment fees. As of December 31, 2019, the Company recorded approximately $ 681.9 million as long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheets. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded $ 30.7 million, $ 33.7 million and $ 5.8 million of interest expense, respectively.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION In June 2011, the Company’s stockholders approved the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (“2011 Plan”). The 2011 Plan, which as amended authorized 16.0 million shares of common stock to be issued, allowed for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock awards (“RSAs”), restricted stock units (“RSUs”), performance shares and performance units. During 2018, the 2011 Plan was merged into the 2018 Plan (defined below). As a result, there were no shares of common stock remaining available for future grant under the 2011 Plan. In June 2013, the Company’s stockholders approved the 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) with approximately 0.3 million shares of common stock available to be issued. In June 2016 and 2019, the Company’s stockholders approved additional approximately 0.3 million and 0.5 million shares, respectively, of common stock available to be issued to be added to the 2013 ESPP. As of December 31, 2019, 0.6 million shares of common stock remain available for future grant under the 2013 ESPP. In September 2014, the Company initiated the 2014 Employment Commencement Incentive Plan (“2014 Plan”) with approximately 0.6 million shares of common stock available to be issued. In October 2015, June 2017 and July 2018, the 2014 Plan was increased by 1.0 million, 3.8 million and 1.2 million shares of common stock available to be issued, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, 0.6 million shares of common stock remain available for future grant under the 2014 Plan. In June 2018, the Company’s stockholders approved the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (“2018 Plan”). The 2018 Plan, which authorized 2.9 million shares of common stock to be issued, allows for the grant of stock options, SARs, RSAs, RSUs, performance shares and performance units. The 2011 Plan was merged into the 2018 Plan and, as a result, all remaining shares in the 2011 Plan were transferred into the 2018 Plan. As of December 31, 2019, 3.4 million shares of common stock remain available for future grant under the 2018 Plan. Stock Options In general, stock options have a ten-year term and vest over a four-year period, with one-fourth of the underlying shares vesting on the first anniversary of the grant and 1/48th of the underlying shares vesting monthly thereafter, such that the underlying shares will be fully vested on the fourth anniversary of the grant, subject to the terms of the applicable plan under which they were granted. The fair values of stock options granted during the periods presented are measured on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, with the following assumptions: For the Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Risk-free interest rate (1) 1.4 - 2.5% 2.5 - 3.0% 1.6 - 2.1% Expected dividend yield (2) — — — Expected term (3) 5.04 years 5.06 years 4.2 - 4.8 years Expected volatility (4) 52.5 - 68.9% 52.4 - 60.8% 54.0 - 63.0% (1) The risk-free interest rate is estimated using an average of Treasury bill interest rates over a historical period commensurate with the expected term of the option that correlates to the prevailing interest rates at the time of grant. (2) The expected dividend yield is zero as the Company has not paid any dividends to date and does not expect to pay dividends in the future. (3) The expected term is estimated using historical exercise behavior. (4) The expected volatility is the implied volatility in exchange-traded options of the Company’s common stock. The amounts estimated according to the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model may not be indicative of the actual values realized upon the exercise of these options by the holders.

If the sales targets are achieved within the required time frame, the number of RSAs may be increased from 71,925 to 89,906 shares. In December 2017, the Company modified the expiration date of these RSAs from June 30, 2018 to January 1, 2019 . As a result of this modification, the fair value per RSA was changed from $ 48.94 to $ 54.29 . Through December 31, 2017, the Company had no t recorded any stock-based compensation expense associated with these awards as the achievement of the performance conditions was not deemed probable. As of December 31, 2018, the first sales target related to these RSAs was achieved and, accordingly, the Company recognized approximately $ 3.3 million of stock-based compensation expense during the year ended December 31, 2018. The second target was not achieved and the shares related to this target were subsequently cancelled and no expense was recognized. Restricted Stock Units The Company also grants RSUs to members of its board of directors and employees.

As of December 31, 2019, there were no RSUs with performance conditions remaining to be vested. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized approximately $ 0.5 million, $ 0.2 million and $ 2.9 million of stock-based compensation expense, respectively. Stock Appreciation Rights The Company issues SARs on the same terms as options granted to employees. The grant date fair value of the SARs is determined using the same valuation assumptions as for stock options described above. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the SARs.

The expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 3 years. Of this amount, $ 109.5 million relates to options with service conditions only, $ 22.1 million relates to awards with service and market conditions, less than $ 0.1 million relates to awards with performance conditions, and the remaining $ 49.5 million related to restricted stock awards or restricted stock units with service conditions only. 16. 401 (K) PLAN The Company sponsors a 401(k) Plan (“the Plan”) in the U.S. and other retirement plans in the rest of the world, all of which are defined contribution plans. The Plan is available to all employees who are age 21 or older. Participants may make voluntary contributions and the Company makes matching contributions according to the Plan’s matching formula. Matching contributions fully vest after one year of service for all employees. The expense related to the Plan primarily consists of the Company’s matching contributions. Expense related to the Plan totaled $ 3.4 million, $ 2.1 million and $ 1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 17.

In February 2019, the Company exercised its option to acquire Myonexus. Accumulated costs of $ 253.7 million, associated with the Myonexus acquisition, were expensed for U.S. GAAP purposes. Of the $253.7 million in accumulated costs, $ 85.0 million relates to up-front and milestone payments as a result of the execution of the Warrant Agreement in May 2018 as well as certain development milestones being achieved or becoming probable of being achieved and $ 168.7 million relates to the exercise of the exclusive option to acquire Myonexus in February 2019. For U.S. income tax purposes, these costs are considered to be an outside investment in the subsidiary and are not currently deductible for tax purposes. The permanent difference related to this acquisition is separately stated in the rate reconciliation above. In December 2012, the Company licensed certain intellectual property of Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. to its wholly owned Netherlands subsidiary, Sarepta International C.V. The parties also entered into a contract research agreement under which Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. performs research services for Sarepta International C.V. In January 2016, Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. entered into a manufacturing and distribution agreement as well as service agreement with Sarepta International C.V. In conjunction with its recent filings, it was determined that beginning in 2016, Sarepta International C.V. is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business by the entity in the U.S. and, accordingly, the 2016, 2017 and 2018 losses are subject to U.S. income taxes. In May 2018, Sarepta International C.V. merged into another wholly owned U.S. subsidiary of Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. F-33 The following table summarizes the analysis of the deferred tax assets and liabilities for each of the periods indicated: As of December 31, 2019 2018 (in thousands) Deferred tax assets: Net operating loss carryforwards $ 304,033 $ 212,342 Difference in depreciation and amortization 40,095 55,162 Research and development tax credits 103,806 67,309 Stock-based compensation 24,114 15,538 Lease liabilities 15,796 4,831 Deferred revenue 939 888 Capitalized inventory 18,255 22,943 Other 16,270 15,727 Total deferred tax assets 523,308 394,740 Deferred tax liabilities: Right of use asset ( 10,782 ) — Debt discount ( 23,099 ) ( 25,162 ) Total deferred tax liabilities ( 33,881 ) ( 25,162 ) Valuation allowance ( 488,829 ) ( 369,345 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 598 $ 233 The Company has evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of its U.S. net deferred tax assets, which are comprised principally of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, research and development tax credit carryforwards, stock-based compensation expense, capitalized inventory, and intangibles. Under the applicable accounting standards, management has considered the Company’s history of losses and concluded that it is more likely than not that the Company will not recognize the benefits of net federal and state deferred tax assets. Accordingly, a full valuation allowance of the U.S. net deferred tax asset had been established at December 31, 2019 and 2018. The net change in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was an increase of $ 119.5 million and $ 164.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. This increase for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to the generation of federal and state net operating losses and income tax credits. The Company generated foreign deferred tax assets mainly consisting of net operating loss carryforwards, stock-based compensation and unrealized gain/losses. Based upon the income projections in the majority of the foreign jurisdictions, the Company believes it will realize the benefit of its future deductible differences in these jurisdictions. As such, the Company has not recorded a valuation allowance against these foreign jurisdictions. Brazil, the Netherlands, Czech Republic, and Spain have generated deferred tax assets, which consist of net operating loss carryforwards and stock-based compensation expense. The Company has concluded that it is more likely than not that we will not recognize the future benefits of the deferred tax assets, and accordingly, a full valuation allowance has been recorded against these foreign deferred tax assets. In 2019, the Company undertook an internal restructuring involving its subsidiary in Switzerland. The restructuring resulted in the utilization of all of its net operating loss carryforwards and the release of its previously established valuation allowance of $ 7.9 million. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $ 1,166.2 million and $ 859.0 million, respectively, available to reduce future taxable income. The federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of $ 579.9 million and $ 807.7 million will expire at various dates between 2020 and 2039 . The federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of $ 586.3 million and $ 51.3 million, respectively, can be carried forward indefinitely. Utilization of these net operating losses could be limited under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and similar state laws based on ownership changes and the value of the Company’s stock. Additionally, the Company has $ 74.7 million and $ 34.1 million of federal and state research and development credits, respectively, available to offset future taxable income. These federal and state research and development credits begin to expire between 2020 and 2039 and between 2020 and 2034 , respectively. The Company also has foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 8.0 million, mainly derived from the net operating loss generated by its subsidiary in Brazil, which may be carried forward indefinitely. The Company or one of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S., and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The federal, state and foreign income tax returns are generally subject to tax examinations for the tax years ended December 31, 2016 through December 31, 2018. To the extent the Company has tax attribute carryforwards, the tax years in which the attribute was generated may still be adjusted upon examination by the Internal Revenue Service, state or foreign tax authorities to the extent utilized in a future period. F-34 The follow table summarizes the reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of total unrecognized tax benefits for each of the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 (in thousands) Balance at beginning of the period $ 37,544 $ 5,134 $ 4,644 Increase related to current year tax positions 4,275 2,164 735 Increase related to prior year tax positions 109 30,246 — Decrease related to prior year tax positions ( 175 ) — ( 245 ) Balance at end of the period $ 41,753 $ 37,544 $ 5,134 The balance of total unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2019, if recognized, would not affect the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations, due to a full valuation allowance against the Company’s U.S. deferred tax assets. The Company does not expect that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly in the next twelve months. The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. It had no accrual for interest or penalties on its balance sheet at December 31, 2019 or 2018. No interest and/or penalties were recognized in 2018 or 2017. 19. LEASES The adoption of ASC 842 resulted in the recognition of operating lease liabilities and ROU assets of $ 60.1 million and $ 42.5 million, respectively, on the Company’s balance sheet relating to its leases for its corporate headquarters and its office and lab space on the January 1, 2019 transition date. Further, the Company reclassified upon adoption $ 18.0 million of deferred rent which reduced the ROU assets recognized on the balance sheet, in accordance with the transition guidance. As of December 31, 2019, operating lease assets were $ 37.9 million and operating lease liabilities were $ 55.6 million. Amounts related to financing leases were immaterial. The following table contains a summary of the lease costs recognized under ASC 842 and other information pertaining to the Company’s operating leases for the year ended December 31, 2019: For the Year Ended December 31, 2019 (in thousands) Lease cost Operating lease cost $ 10,335 Variable lease cost 3,967 Total lease cost $ 14,302 Other information Operating lease payments 10,416 Operating lease liabilities arising from obtaining ROU assets — Weighted average remaining lease term 5.5 Weighted average discount rate 7.50 % F-35 The following table summarizes maturities of lease liabilities and the reconciliation of lease liabilities as of December 31, 2019: As of December 31, 2019 (in thousands) 2020 $ 11,718 2021 12,891 2022 11,080 2023 11,230 2024 11,471 Thereafter 9,654 Total minimum lease payments 68,044 Less: imputed interest ( 12,478 ) Total operating lease liabilities $ 55,566 Included in the condensed consolidated balance sheet: Current portion of lease liabilities within other current liabilities $ 7,846 Lease liabilities 47,720 Total operating lease liabilities $ 55,566 For comparable purposes, aggregate future minimum non-cancellable commitments under leases as of December 31, 2018, are as follows: As of December 31, 2018 (in thousands) 2020 $ 11,395 2021 12,558 2022 10,757 2023 10,898 2024 11,128 Thereafter 9,396 Total minimum lease payments $ 66,132 Excluded from the table above are obligations under manufacturing agreements with Brammer Bio MA, LLC (“Brammer”) and Paragon Bioservices, Inc. (“Paragon”). The Company has determined that both agreements contain an embedded lease. However, both leases have not yet commenced as of December 31, 2019, and as such, right of use assets and lease liabilities have not yet been recognized on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 21, Commitments and Contingencies for additional details relating to these two agreements. F-36 20. NET LOSS PER SHARE Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding. Given that the Company recorded a net loss for each of the periods presented, there is no difference between basic and diluted net loss per share since the effect of common stock equivalents would be anti-dilutive and are, therefore, excluded from the diluted net loss per share calculation. For the Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 (in thousands, except per share amounts) Net loss $ ( 715,075 ) $ ( 361,918 ) $ ( 50,688 ) Weighted-average common shares outstanding - basic 73,615 66,250 58,818 Effect of dilutive securities* — — — Weighted-average common shares outstanding - diluted 73,615 66,250 58,818 Net loss per share — basic and diluted $ ( 9.71 ) $ ( 5.46 ) $ ( 0.86 ) * For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, stock options, RSAs, RSUs, SARs and ESPP to purchase approximately 9.1 million, 9.1 million and 9.4 million shares of common stock, respectively, were excluded from the net loss per share calculation as their effect would have been anti-dilutive. The Company accounts for the effect of the 2024 Notes on diluted net earnings per share using the if-converted method as they may be settled in cash or shares at the Company’s option. While the closing price on December 31, 2019 exceeded the conversion price of $ 73.42 , the potential shares issuable under the 2024 Notes were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share as they were anti-dilutive using the if-converted method. In the period of conversion, the 2024 Notes will have no impact on diluted net loss if they are settled in cash and will have an impact on diluted earnings per share if the 2024 Notes are settled in shares upon conversion and when the Company is in an income position. 21. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Manufacturing Obligations The Company has entered into long-term contractual arrangements from time to time for the provision of goods and services. Brammer Bio MA, LLC The Company entered into a Development, Commercial Manufacturing and Supply Agreement (the “Brammer Manufacturing Agreement”) and, subsequently, entered into the first amendment (the “Amendment”) to the Brammer Manufacturing Agreement with Brammer in June 2018 and May 2019, respectively (collectively, “Brammer Supply Agreements”). Pursuant to the terms of the Brammer Supply Agreements, Brammer agreed to provide the Company with access to clinical and commercial manufacturing capacity for its gene therapy programs. Under the Brammer Manufacturing Agreement, the Company will purchase product in batches from Brammer, subject to minimum and maximum annual purchase requirements. Further, the Company: (i) was required to make a $ 20.0 million advance payment to Brammer upon execution of the agreement in June 2018, (ii) was required to make two non-refundable payments of $ 5.0 million each to Brammer in the third and fourth quarter of 2018 to be used in the specification, selection, and procurement of the related process equipment to be utilized under the agreement, and (iii) was required to make a $ 10.0 million quarterly capacity access fee payment to Brammer throughout the term of the agreement. As a result of the Amendment: (i) the Company now has access to substantially all of the related facility’s capacity, subject to certain minimum and maximum volume limitations, (ii) the Company was required to make a $ 6.0 million advance payment to Brammer upon execution of the Amendment, and (iii) the quarterly capacity access fee payments due to Brammer throughout the term of the agreement increased from $ 10.0 million to $ 13.3 million, starting January 1, 2020. However, through December 31, 2019, a reduced quarterly capacity access fee was in effect as Brammer worked towards achieving full capacity at its facility. In addition, the application of the advance payments will reduce the quarterly capacity access fees paid through 2021. The term of the Brammer Supply Agreements will continue for a period of six years following the first regulatory approval of a product manufactured under the agreements. The term will automatically renew for successive two years unless the Company notifies Brammer of its intention not to renew (no less than twenty-four months prior to the expiration of the term). The Company also has the ability to terminate the agreement prior to expiration but would be required to continue remitting capacity access fees to Brammer for up to eight additional quarters. F-37 Upon execution of the Amendment, the Company determined that the Brammer Supply Agreements contain an embedded lease because the Company now has the right to direct the use of the facility and related equipment therein. Further, the Company determined that it did not control the facility or related equipment during construction and, thus, the lease did not fall in the scope of “build-to-suit” accounting. The lease has not commenced as of December 31, 2019 because of the clean room suites at the Brammer facility are not yet available for use by the Company. Accordingly, total cumulative payments made to Brammer of $ 75.5 million have been recorded as an other non-current asset in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and will be considered in the initial measurement of the cost of the right-of-use asset at the lease commencement date. This amount, along with any additional quarterly access fees payable prior to the lease commencement date, will be amortized on a straight-line basis as rent expense over the term of the embedded lease, beginning on the lease commencement date, currently anticipated to occur during the first half of 2020. Rent expense recognized prior to regulatory approval of the related product will be classified to research and development expense. Upon regulatory approval, rent expense will be classified to cost of inventory with the recognition in cost of sales as the sales of product occur. Paragon Bioservices, Inc. The Company entered into a manufacturing collaboration agreement (the “Paragon Collaboration Agreement”) and, subsequently, entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement (the “Paragon Supply Agreement”) with Paragon in October 2018 and February 2019, respectively (collectively, the “Paragon Agreements”). Pursuant to the terms of the Paragon Agreements, Paragon agreed to provide the Company with two dedicated clean room suites and an option to reserve two additional clean room suites for its gene therapy programs. In September 2019, the Company exercised the option to gain access to the additional clean room suites. The Paragon Agreements will expire on December 31, 2024 . The Company has the ability to terminate the Paragon Agreements prior to expiration, subject to potential additional financial consideration. Under the Paragon Agreements, the Company will purchase product in batches from Paragon subject to minimum annual purchase requirements during two periods: the pre-launch period and the post-launch period. During the pre-launch period, the Company is obligated to purchase a minimum amount of $ 4.0 million of services per quarter per clean room. During the post-launch period, on an annual basis, the Company is obligated to purchase a minimum number of batches per clean room. Further, the Company is required to pay Paragon: (i) use fees of $ 1.0 million per year per clean room suite after the clean rooms are fully qualified and validated to manufacture the Company’s materials, and (ii) clean room reservation fees totaling $ 48.0 million. Additional use fees and reservation fees are required if the Company has equipment needs beyond the basic equipment package included in the initial clean room suites. In addition, Paragon will provide the Company with a credit of up to 100 % of the clean room use fee if certain clean room capacity utilization thresholds are met. The Company has concluded that the Paragon Agreements contain an embedded lease as the Company has the right to direct the use of the facility and related equipment therein. The Company also determined that it did not control the facility or related equipment during construction and, thus, the lease did not fall in the scope of “build-to-suit” accounting. The lease has not commenced as of December 31, 2019 because the clean room suites at the Paragon facility are not yet available for use by the Company. Accordingly, cumulative payments totaling $ 40.1 million made to Paragon have been recorded as an other non-current asset in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and will be considered in the initial measurement of the cost of the right-of-use asset at the lease commencement date. This amount, along with any additional payments made prior to the lease commencement date, will be amortized on a straight-line basis as rent expense over the term of the embedded lease, beginning on the lease commencement date, currently anticipated to occur in the first quarter of 2020. Use fees associated with the clean room suites are considered contingent rental payments and will be charged to rent expense when (and if) incurred. Rent expense recognized prior to regulatory approval of the related product will be classified to research and development expense. Upon regulatory approval, rent expense will be classified to cost of inventory with the recognition in cost of sales as the sales of product occur. Aldevron, LLC In December 2018, the Company entered into a Clinical and Commercial Supply Agreement (the “CCSA”) with Aldevron LLC (“Aldevron”) for the supply of plasmid DNA to fulfill its needs for gene therapy clinical trials and commercial supply. Pursuant to the terms of the CCSA, Aldevron agreed to reserve a certain number of manufacturing slots (“Reserved Slots”) on a quarterly basis. The initial term of the CCSA expired on December 31, 2019 . The Company exercised the option to extend the CCSA to December 31, 2020 (the “2020 Option”) and has another option to extend the term of the CCSA for an additional year to December 31, 2021 (the “2021 Renewal Right”). The Company may be required to make an additional $ 20.0 million in prepayments associated with the CCSA should the Company exercise the 2021 Renewal Right. The prepayments will be credited back to Sarepta, until exhausted, for each batch of product delivered by Aldevron, in an amount equal to 50 % of the batch invoice amount. The Company has determined that the CCSA does not contain an embedded lease because it does not convey the right to control the use of Aldevron’s facility or related equipment therein. As of December 31, 2019, the Company recorded $ 22.8 million in other current assets in the accompanying balance sheets related to the prepayments made to Aldevron under the CCSA. The gross cost of batches purchased from Aldevron since inception of the agreement have been classified as research and development expense. In the event the Company does not expect services under the CCSA to be rendered to fully exhaust any prepayments made to Aldevron, the applicable balance will be charged to expense at the time this determination is made. F-38 The following table presents non-cancelable contractual obligations arising from long-term contractual arrangements: As of December 31, 2019 (in thousands) 2020 $ 378,744 2021 183,661 2022 64,653 2023 58,319 2024 58,309 Thereafter 149,350 Total manufacturing commitments $ 893,036 Additionally, should the Company obtain regulatory approval for any drug product candidate produced as a part of the Company’s manufacturing obligations above, additional minimum batch requirements with the respective manufacturing parties would be required. Other Funding Commitments The Company has several on-going clinical trials in various clinical trial stages. Its most significant clinical trial expenditures are to contract research organizations (“CROs”). The CRO contracts are generally cancellable at the Company’s option. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has approximately $ 91.4 million in cancellable future commitments based on existing CRO contracts. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized approximately $ 31.6 million, $ 19.6 million and $ 13.9 million, respectively, for expenditures incurred by CROs. Litigation In the normal course of business, the Company may from time to time be named as a party to various legal claims, actions and complaints, including matters involving securities, employment, intellectual property, effects from the use of therapeutics utilizing its technology, or others. For example, on August 30, 2019, Plaintiff Andrew Salinger filed a putative class action complaint against the Company and two of its current officers, Douglas S. Ingram and Sandesh Mahatme (collectively, the “Defendants”), in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint alleges that the Defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, as well as Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, in connection with the Company’s disclosures related to golodirsen. The proposed class consists of all persons or entities who acquired Company securities between September 6, 2017 and August 19, 2019. On December 17, 2019, the district court appointed Bernard Portnoy as lead plaintiff, and set a briefing schedule requiring the amended complaint to be filed on February 18, 2020 and requiring Defendants to answer or otherwise respond to the amended complaint on April 17, 2020. Defendants’ motion to transfer the case to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts is pending. On February 14, 2020, the lead plaintiff filed a Notice of Voluntary Dismissal of his claims against all Defendants and the clerk referred the Notice to the court for review and approval. The court has taken no further action. The Company is unable to provide an estimate of possible loss or range of possible loss. On January 7, 2020, Plaintiff Al Lutzker filed a stockholder derivative complaint, purportedly on behalf of the Company, against two of the Company’s current officers, Douglas S. Ingram and Sandesh Mahatme, and six current members of Company’s Board of Directors, M. Kathleen Behrens, Richard J. Barry, Michael W. Bonney, Mary Ann Gray, Claude Nicaise, and Hans Wigzell (collectively, the “Defendants”), in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. The complaint asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty, insider selling, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and violations of Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder, in connection with the Company’s disclosures related to golodirsen. The Company is unable to provide an estimate of possible loss or range of possible loss. 22. SUBSEQUENT EVENT On February 14, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement to sell the rare pediatric disease PRV it received from the FDA in connection with the approval of VYONDYS 53 for consideration of $ 111.0 million. The closing of the transaction is subject to the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and other customary conditions. When the transaction closes, the net proceeds will be recorded as a gain from sale of the PRV as it does not have a carrying value at the time of the sale. The Company has evaluated subsequent events from the date of the consolidated balance sheet through the date the consolidated financial statements were issued. F-39 23.

Business. Overview We are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on helping patients through the discovery and development of unique RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene therapy and other genetic therapeutic modalities for the treatment of rare diseases. Applying our proprietary, highly-differentiated and innovative technologies, and through collaborations with our strategic partners, we are developing potential therapeutic candidates for a broad range of diseases and disorders, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy (“DMD”), Limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (“LGMDs”), Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA (“MPS IIIA”) and Pompe. Our first commercial product in the U.S., EXONDYS 51 ® (eteplirsen) Injection (“EXONDYS 51”), was granted accelerated approval by the FDA on September 19, 2016. EXONDYS 51 is indicated for the treatment of DMD in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 51 skipping. EXONDYS 51 uses our phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (“PMO”) chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 51 of the dystrophin gene. Exon skipping is intended to promote the production of an internally truncated but functional dystrophin protein. The original PMO structure and variations of this structure that are so-called PMO-based (collectively “PMO-based”) are central to our proprietary chemistry platform. PMO technologies can be used to selectively up-regulate or down-regulate the production of a target protein through pre-mRNA splice alteration. Thus, PMO-based compounds have the potential to be designed to create more, less, or none of certain proteins, or produce analogues of endogenous proteins. This technology can be used to correct disease-causing genetic errors by inducing the targeted expression of novel proteins. In addition to our commercial-stage product, we have PMO-based product candidates in clinical development designed to treat those patients with DMD who have genetic mutations amenable to skipping exon 53 of the Duchenne gene (SRP-4053) and exon 45 of the Duchenne gene (SRP-4045) (golodirsen and casimersen, respectively). In December 2018, we completed the submission of our rolling New Drug Application (“NDA”) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) seeking accelerated approval for golodirsen. The FDA accepted the NDA and granted priority review status for golodirsen with a targeted regulatory action date of August 19, 2019. The FDA also indicated that it does not intend to conduct an advisory board for golodirsen. We are currently conducting both a Phase 1/2 clinical trial and a Phase 3 placebo controlled confirmatory clinical trial (ESSENCE) studying casimersen . We anticipate submitting an NDA to the FDA for casimersen in 2019 if we believe that the results of an interim dystrophin analysis in the ESSENCE trial are positive. We also have other product candidates in discovery and preclinical development that are designed to skip other exons. The PMO chemistry platform is highly adaptable, and we have developed next-generation PMO-based chemistries for advancing RNA-targeted therapeutics. These next-generation chemistries are specifically designed to enhance tissue targeting, intracellular delivery, target selectivity and drug potency. One of these novel technologies is based on cell-penetrating peptide-conjugated PMO (“PPMO”). The PPMO features covalent attachment of a cell-penetrating peptide to a PMO with the goal of enhanced delivery into the cell. Our most advanced PPMO product candidate is SRP-5051, which is designed to treat DMD in patients with genetic mutations amenable to exon 51 skipping. We are currently conducting a first-in-human, single ascending dose, Phase 1 clinical trial for this product candidate, which we expect to complete in 2019. As part of our multifaceted approach to DMD, we are also exploring gene therapy technologies to treat DMD. In collaboration with Nationwide Children’s Hospital (“Nationwide”), we are testing a product candidate, SRP-9001, that aims to express a smaller but still functional version of dystrophin (“micro-dystrophin”). We use a unique adeno-associated virus (“AAV”) vector called AAVrh74 to transport the transgene – the genetic material that will make the protein of interest – to the target cells. Micro-dystrophin is used because naturally-occurring dystrophin is too large to fit in an AAV. On October 3, 2018, Nationwide presented positive results from a Phase 1/2a clinical trial testing SRP-9001 in four individuals with DMD enrolled in the trial. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we commenced a placebo-controlled trial with the goal to establish the functional benefits of micro-dystrophin expressions. We plan to conduct a confirmatory trial using commercial supply of SRP-9001 by the end of 2019, pending regulatory feedback. In 2018, through a number of strategic collaboration and licensing arrangements, we expanded our pipeline to include programs that aim to treat a broad range of rare diseases in addition to DMD, such as LGMDs, Charcot-Marie-Tooth (“CMT”), MPS IIIA and Pompe disease. One of our strategic partners, Myonexus Therapeutics, Inc. (“Myonexus”) develops gene therapy programs for various forms of LGMDs. The most advanced of Myonexus’ product candidates, MYO-101, is designed to transfer a gene that codes for and restores beta-sarcoglycan protein with the goal of restoring the dystrophin associated protein complex. MYO-101 utilizes the same vector and promoter used in the development of SRP-9001. Myonexus commenced a Phase 1/2a trial of MYO-101 in the fourth quarter of 2018, and on February 27, 2019, we announced positive two-month data from the first three-patient cohort dosed in the MYO-101 trial. -4- Our pipeline includes 25 programs at various stages of pre-clinical and clinical development , reflecting our aspiration to apply our multifaceted approach and expertise in precision genetic medicine to make a profound difference in the lives of patients suffering from rare diseases. Objectives and Business Strategy We believe that our proprietary technology platforms and collaborations can be used to develop novel pharmaceutical products to treat a broad range of diseases and address key currently-unmet medical needs. We intend to leverage our technology platforms, organizational capabilities, collaborations and resources to lead the field of precision genetic medicines, including the treatment of rare, neuromuscular and other diseases, with a diversified portfolio of product candidates. In pursuit of this objective, we intend to focus on the following activities: • building our gene therapy engine, including developing gene therapy product candidates, operationalizing our manufacturing strategy and establishing our commercial foundation in preparation for potential regulatory approvals; • advancing the development of additional exon-skipping product candidates (e.g., golodirsen and casimersen), launching potential approved products and supporting marketed products; • investing in next-generation precision medicine through internal research, strategic partnerships, collaborations and other potential opportunities; • ensuring we have the appropriate capitalization to fund our business objectives and strategies, including by raising additional capital through licensing, collaborations and offerings of equity and / or debt; and • nurturing our culture, which is based on bias to action, a self-starter mentality, smart and appropriate risk-taking and high ethics. Core Therapeutic Areas DMD : We primarily focus on rapidly advancing the development of our potentially disease-modifying pipeline of exon-skipping, gene therapy and gene editing product candidates targeting DMD. DMD is a rare x-linked recessive genetic disorder affecting children (primarily males) that is characterized by progressive muscle deterioration and weakness. It is the most common type of muscular dystrophy. DMD is caused by an absence of dystrophin, a protein that protects muscle cells. The absence of dystrophin in muscle cells leads to significant cell damage and ultimately causes muscle cell death and fibrotic replacement. In the absence of dystrophin protein, affected individuals generally experience the following symptoms, although disease severity and life expectancy vary: • muscle damage characterized by inflammation, fibrosis and loss of myofibers beginning at an early age; • muscle weakness and progressive loss of muscle function beginning in the first few years of life; • decline of ambulation and respiratory function after the age of seven; • total loss of ambulation in the pre-teenage or early teenage years; • progressive loss of upper extremity function during mid- to late-teens; and • respiratory and/or cardiac failure, resulting in death before the age of 30. LGMDs are autosomal recessive, monogenic, rare neuromuscular diseases caused by missense and deletion mutations. These diseases affect males and females equally. Some types of LGMDs affect skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle. More severe forms of LGMDs mimic DMD. LGMDs as a class affect an estimated range of approximately 1 in every 14,500 to 1 in every 123,000 individuals. Currently, there are no available treatment options for LGMDs. MPS IIIA is a rare inherited neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder characterized by intractable behavioral problems and developmental regression resulting in early death. It is caused by mutations in the SGSH gene, which encodes an enzyme called Heparan-N-sulfamidase necessary for heparan sulfate (“HS”) recycling in cells. The disrupted lysosomal degradation and resulting storage of HS and glycolipids such as gangliosides leads to severe neurodegeneration. MPS IIIA affects approximately 1 in 100,000 individuals and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. There are currently no treatment options for patients. CMT is a group of hereditary, degenerative nerve diseases that are caused by mutations in genes that produce proteins involved in the structure and function of either the peripheral nerve axon or the myelin sheath. CMT can cause degeneration of motor skills, resulting in muscle weakness, and limiting patients’ ability to walk or use their hands, and in some cases, can cause degeneration of sensory nerves, resulting in a reduced ability to feel heat, cold, and pain. CMT affects approximately 1 in every 2,500 -5- individuals, while CMT type 1A, which is most often caused by an extra copy of the PMP22 gene, affects approximately 50,000 patients in the U.S. Most patients are diagnosed at infancy, while other patients develop symptoms at adolescence. Currently, there are no available treatment options. Pompe disease is caused by mutation in the gene that codes for the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (“GAA”), which is responsible for metabolizing glycogen in lysosomes. The disease causes buildup of glycogen in the body's cells, which in certain organs and tissues, especially muscles, impairs ability to function normally. Pompe disease is progressive and often debilitating, disables the heart and skeletal muscles with muscle weakness worsening over time. It affects both sexes equally and is often fatal. Pompe disease affects an estimated 1 in approximately every 40,000 individuals. Our Commercial Product EXONDYS 51 , our first commercial product, approved by the FDA on September 19, 2016, is indicated for the treatment of DMD in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 51 skipping EXONDYS 51 uses our PMO chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 51 of the dystrophin gene. PMO-based compounds are synthetic compounds that bind to complementary sequences of RNA by standard Watson-Crick nucleobase pairing. The two key structural differences between PMO-based compounds and naturally occurring RNA are that the PMO nucleobases are bound to synthetic morpholino rings instead of ribose rings, and the morpholino rings are linked by phosphorodiamidate groups instead of phosphodiester groups. Replacement of the negatively charged phosphodiester in RNA with the uncharged phosphorodiamidate group in PMO eliminates linkage ionization at physiological pH. Due to these modifications, PMO-based compounds are resistant to degradation by plasma and intracellular enzymes. Unlike the RNA-targeted technologies such as siRNAs and DNA gapmers, PMO-based compounds operate by steric blockade rather than by cellular enzymatic degradation to achieve their biological effects. Thus, PMOs use a fundamentally different mechanism from other RNA-targeted technologies. We are in the process of assessing and conducting various EXONDYS 51 clinical trials, including studies that are required to comply with regulatory NDA and studies we need to conduct to comply with our post-marketing FDA requirements/commitments to verify and describe the clinical benefit of EXONDYS 51. EXONDYS 51 targets the most frequent series of mutations that cause DMD. Approximately 13% of DMD patients are amenable to exon 51 skipping. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, the Company recorded net revenue of $301.0 million, $154.6 million, and $5.4 million, respectively, related to the sale of EXONDYS 51. Our Pipeline Golodirsen (SRP-4053) uses our PMO chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 53 of the DMD gene. Golodirsen is designed to bind to exon 53 of dystrophin pre-mRNA, resulting in exclusion, or “skipping”, of this exon during mRNA processing in patients with genetic mutations that are amenable to exon 53 skipping. We are enrolling and dosing patients in ESSENCE ( 4045-301) , our Phase 3 placebo controlled confirmatory trial in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 45 or 53 skipping using casimersen and golodirsen, respectively. Golodirsen is also being evaluated in a Phase 1/2 trial having two parts. Part I of the Phase 1/2 trial has been completed, and Part II, an open-label portion of the trial, is expected to be completed in 2019 (Study 4053-101). In September 2017, we announced positive results of an analysis that included biopsies of the bicep muscle at baseline and on-treatment at the Part II, Week 48 time point. The 4053-101 interim trial results demonstrated statistical significance on all primary and secondary biological endpoints. In December 2018, we completed the submission of our rolling NDA to the FDA seeking accelerated approval for golodirsen. The FDA accepted the NDA and granted priority review status for golodirsen with a targeted regulatory action date of August 19, 2019. The FDA also indicated that it does not intend to conduct an advisory board for golodirsen. Casimersen (SRP-4045) uses our PMO chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 45 of the DMD gene. Casimersen is designed to bind to exon 45 of dystrophin pre-mRNA, resulting in exclusion, or “skipping”, of this exon during mRNA processing in patients with genetic mutations that are amenable to exon 45 skipping. We are enrolling and dosing patients in ESSENCE, further described above. We have completed a dose titration portion (Phase 1) and the open-label portion (Phase 2) of a Sarepta sponsored Phase 1/2 the trial clinical trial studying casimersen (4045-101) . We anticipate submitting an NDA to the FDA for casimersen in 2019 if we believe the results of an interim dystrophin analysis in the ESSENCE study are positive. SRP-5051 uses our next-generation chemistry platform, PPMO, and our exon-skipping technology to skip exon 51 of the dystrophin gene. The PPMO technology features covalent attachment of a cell-penetrating peptide to a PMO with the goal of enhanced delivery into the cell. In pre-clinical research, our proprietary class of PPMO compounds demonstrated an increase in dystrophin production and a more durable response compared to PMO. In addition, PPMO treatment in non-human primates results in high levels of exon-skipping in skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle tissues. Pre-clinical trials also indicate that PPMOs may require less frequent dosing than PMOs, and that PPMOs could potentially be tailored to reach other organs beyond muscle. -6- In the fourth quarter of 2017, we received clearance from the FDA and commenced a first-in-human, single ascending dose, trial for the treatment of DMD using SRP-5051 in patients who a re amenable to exon 51 skipping . We expect to complete this trial in 2019 . SRP-9001 (micro-dystrophin gene therapy program) , in collaboration with Nationwide, aims to express micro-dystrophin – a smaller but still functional version of dystrophin. A unique, engineered micro-dystrophin is used because naturally-occurring dystrophin is too large to fit in an AAV vector. SRP-9001 developed in collaboration with Nationwide employs the AAVrh74 vector, which is designed to be systemically and robustly delivered to skeletal, diaphragm and cardiac muscle without promiscuously crossing the blood brain barrier, which we believe makes it a strong candidate to treat peripheral neuromuscular diseases. An MHCK7 promoter was chosen for its ability to robustly express in the heart, which is critically important for patients with DMD, who typically die from pulmonary or cardiac complications. Lastly, the transgene was designed to maintain spectrin-like repeats 2 and 3, which has been reported to be critical to maintaining muscle force. In the fourth quarter of 2017, an investigational new drug (“IND”) application for the micro-dystrophin gene therapy program, in collaboration with Nationwide, was cleared by the FDA, and a Phase 1/2a clinical trial in individuals with DMD was initiated. On October 3, 2018, Nationwide presented what we believe to be positive updated results from the Phase 1/2a clinical trial in four individuals with DMD enrolled in the trial. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we commenced a placebo-controlled trial with the goal to establish the functional benefits of micro-dystrophin expressions. We plan to conduct a confirmatory trial using commercial supply of SRP-9001 by the end of 2019, pending regulatory feedback. MYO-101 . We are collaborating with Myonexus to develop gene therapy programs for various types of LGMDs. All the Myonexus programs use the AAVrh.74 vector, the same vector used in the micro-dystrophin gene therapy program, to transfect a restorative gene. The most advanced of Myonexus’ product candidates, MYO-101, aims to treat LGMD2E, also known as beta-sarcoglycanopathy, a severe and debilitating form of LGMD characterized by progressive muscle fiber loss, inflammation and muscle fiber replacement with fat and fibrotic tissue. MYO-101 is designed to transfect a gene that codes for and restores beta-sarcoglycan protein with the goal of restoring the dystroglycan complex. MYO-101 has generated positive pre-clinical safety and efficacy data utilizing the AAVrh.74 vector. Myonexus commenced a Phase 1/2a trial of MYO-101 in the fourth quarter of 2018, and on February 27, 2019, we announced positive two-month data from the first three-patient cohort dosed in the MYO-101 trial. GALGT2 . An additional gene therapy program for DMD and other muscular dystrophies, also in collaboration with Nationwide, aims to express the enzyme GALGT2 from an AAV vector. We believe that GALGT2 modifies the dystrophin associated protein complex (DAPC) and up-regulates utrophin (a protein significantly homologous to dystrophin) to protect muscle from damage in the absence of dystrophin. We believe that the micro-dystrophin and GALGT2 technologies have the potential to treat all or nearly all DMD patients regardless of mutation. In the fourth quarter of 2017, an IND application for GALGT2 was cleared by the FDA, and a Phase 1/2a clinical trial testing GALGT2 for the treatment of DMD was initiated. LYS-SAF 302 . We are collaborating with Lysogene S.A. (“Lysogene”) to develop a gene therapy, LYS-SAF302, to treat MPS IIIA. LYS-SAF302 is an AAV-mediated gene therapy, the goal of which is to replace the faulty N-sulfoglucosamine sulfohydrolase (“SGSH”) gene with a healthy copy of the gene. LYS-SAF302 employs the AAVrh10 virus, chosen for its ability to target the central nervous system (“CNS”). Proof-of-concept was established in MPS IIIA pre-clinical models demonstrating strong expression, broad distribution, and the ability of the compound to correct lysosomal storage defects by producing the missing enzyme. Safety data from an IND-enabling toxicity and a biodistribution Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”) trial showed that, at any dose level evaluated, LYS-SAF302 was not associated with unexpected mortality, change in clinical signs, body weight, behavior or macroscopic findings in the brain. The first patient has been dosed in AAVance, a global Phase 2/3 clinical trial of LYS-SAF302, aiming at evaluating the effectiveness of a one-time delivery of a AAVrh10 virus carrying the N-SGSH gene. Neutrophin 3 (CMT Type 1A) . A gene therapy program in collaboration with Nationwide that aims to express neurotrophin 3 (“NT-3”) encoding the NTF3 gene to treat CMT neuropathies, including CMT type 1A. We believe that the delivery of NT-3 may have applicability to other sub-types of CMT in addition to other neuropathies and muscle-wasting diseases. Pre-clinical research has shown the ability of the NT-3 gene construct to regenerate nerves. Further pre-clinical research is under way to explore its potential. A clinical trial to test NT-3 gene therapy is planned to commence dosing in 2019 for CMT type 1A, pending regulatory feedback. We believe that the delivery of NT-3 may have applicability to other sub-types of CMT in addition to other muscle-wasting diseases. Programs in Collaboration with Lacerta . Our collaboration with Lacerta Therapeutics, Inc. (“Lacerta”) utilizes proprietary AAV capsid variants and a scalable vector manufacturing platform to develop treatments for central nervous system and lysosomal storage diseases. The lead candidate, still in discovery phase, is a gene therapy approach with a novel AAV variant for the treatment of Pompe disease. -7- CRSPR/Cas9 . We are exploring, in collaboration with Duke University, the gene-editing technology CRSPR/Cas9 that aims to restore dystrophin expression by removing or “excising” exons directly from the dystrophin gene to correct out-of-frame mutations. CRSPR/Cas9 technology can also potentially be used to fix stop codon mutations in the dystrophin gene so that dystrophin can be translated to a function protein. This program is in the discovery phase. The chart below summarizes the status of our more advanced programs, including those with our strategic partners: Manufacturing, Supply and Distribution We have developed proprietary state-of-the-art Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (“CMC”) and manufacturing capabilities that allow synthesis and purification of our product candidates to support both clinical development as well as commercialization. Our current main focus in manufacturing is to continue scaling up production of our PMO-based therapies and optimizing manufacturing for PPMO and gene therapy-based product candidates. We have entered into certain manufacturing and supply arrangements with third-party suppliers which will in part utilize these capabilities to support production of certain of our product candidates and their components. In 2017, we opened a facility in Andover, Massachusetts, which significantly enhances our research and development manufacturing capabilities. However, we currently do not have internal large scale Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMP”) manufacturing capabilities to produce our product and product candidates for commercial and/or clinical use. For our current and future manufacturing needs, we have entered into supply agreements with specialized contract manufacturing organizations (each a “CMO”) to produce custom raw materials, the active pharmaceutical Ingredients (“APIs”) and finished goods for our product candidates. All of our CMO partners have extensive technical expertise, GMP experience and experience manufacturing our specific technology. For our commercial DMD program, we have commenced work with our existing manufacturers to increase product capacity from mid-scale to large-scale. While there are a limited number of companies that can produce raw materials and APIs in the quantities and with the quality and purity that we require for EXONDYS 51, based on our diligence to date, we believe our current network of manufacturing partners are able to fulfill these requirements, and are capable of continuing to expand capacity as needed. Additionally, we have, and will continue to evaluate further relationships with additional suppliers to increase overall capacity as well as further reduce risks associated with reliance on a limited number of suppliers for manufacturing. EXONDYS 51 is distributed in the U.S. through a limited network of home infusion specialty pharmacy providers that deliver the medication to patients and a specialty distributor that distributes EXONDYS 51 to hospitals and hospital outpatient clinics. With respect to the pre-commercial distribution of eteplirsen to patients outside of the U.S., we have contracted with third party distributors and service providers to distribute eteplirsen in certain countries on a named patient basis and through our ex-U.S. early -8- access programs (“EAP”). We plan to continue building out our network for commercial distribution in jurisdictions in which eteplirsen is approved. Our gene therapy manufacturing capabilities have been greatly enhanced through partnerships with Brammer Bio LLC (“Brammer”), Paragon Bioservices, Inc. (“Paragon”) and Aldevron LLC (“Aldevron”). We have adopted a hybrid manufacturing strategy in which we are building internal manufacturing expertise relative to all aspects of AAV-based manufacturing, including gene therapy and gene editing supply, while closely partnering with first-in-class manufacturing partners to expedite development and commercialization of our gene therapy programs. The partnership with Brammer will support our clinical and commercial manufacturing capacity for our micro-dystrophin DMD gene therapy programs and LGMD programs, while also acting as a manufacturing platform for potential future gene therapy programs. The collaboration integrates process development, clinical production and testing, and commercial manufacturing. Our partnership with Paragon will provide us access to additional commercial manufacturing capacity for our micro-dystrophin DMD gene therapy program, as well as a manufacturing platform for future gene therapy programs, such as LGMD. Aldevron will provide GMP-grade plasmid for our micro-dystrophin DMD gene therapy program and LGMD programs, as well as plasmid source material for future gene therapy programs, such as CMT, MPS IIIA, Pompe and other CNS diseases. Manufacturers and suppliers of product candidates are subject to the FDA’s current GMP (“cGMP”) requirements and other rules and regulations prescribed by foreign regulatory authorities. We depend on our third-party partners for continued compliance with cGMP requirements and applicable foreign standards. Material Agreements We believe that our RNA-targeted and gene therapy technologies could be broadly applicable for the potential development of pharmaceutical products in many therapeutic areas. To further exploit our core technologies, we have and may continue to enter into research, development or commercialization alliances with universities, hospitals, independent research centers, non-profit organizations, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and other entities for specific molecular targets or selected disease indications. We may also selectively pursue opportunities to access certain intellectual property rights that complement our internal portfolio through license agreements or other arrangements. Myonexus On May 3, 2018, we purchased from Myonexus, a privately-held Delaware corporation, a warrant to purchase common stock of Myonexus (the “Warrant”), which, in combination with amendments to the Myonexus certificate of incorporation, provides us with an exclusive option (the “Option”) to acquire Myonexus. In consideration for the Warrant, we made an up-front payment of $60.0 million to Myonexus. On February 26, 2019, we delivered to Myonexus an exercise notice (the “Exercise Notice”) stating our intention to exercise the Option. Prior to the delivery of the Exercise Notice, on February 26, 2019, we entered into a letter agreement (the “Letter Agreement”) with Myonexus to amend certain terms of the Warrant to (i) reduce the payment price we would be required to make at the closing of the Option exercise from $200.0 million to $165.0 million, subject to certain adjustments (the “Warrant Exercise Price”), and (ii) terminate our obligation to pay any development milestone payments that have yet to be earned under the Warrant and pay Myonexus shareholders an additional amount in recognition of amounts Myonexus expended toward the achievement of those milestones, agreed for this purpose to be $6.0 million, to be paid upon exercise of the Option. Our obligation to make contingent payments to the Myonexus’ former shareholders following the exercise of the Option upon achievement of a threshold amount of net sales of Myonexus products and the receipt and subsequent sale of a priority review voucher with respect to a Myonexus product will remain unchanged. We retain the right to terminate the Warrant at any time prior to the closing of the Option exercise, which is expected to occur at the end of our first fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2019, subject to the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended. BioMarin License Agreement On July 17, 2017, Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. and Sarepta International C.V. (collectively, “Sarepta”) and BioMarin Leiden Holding BV, BioMarin Nederlands BV and BioMarin Technologies BV (collectively, “BioMarin”) executed a License Agreement (the “License Agreement”), pursuant to which BioMarin granted Sarepta a royalty-bearing, worldwide license under patent rights (“Licensed Patents”) and know-how (“Licensed Know-How”) controlled by BioMarin with respect to BioMarin’s DMD program, which are potentially necessary or useful for the treatment of DMD, to practice and exploit the Licensed Patents and Licensed Know-How in all fields of use and for all purposes, including to develop and commercialize antisense oligonucleotide products that target one or more exons of the dystrophin gene to induce exon skipping, including eteplirsen (collectively, the “Products”). -9- The license granted by BioMarin to Sarepta under the terms of the License Agreement is exclusive, even as to BioMarin, with respect to the Licensed Patents, and is non-exclusive with respect to Licensed Know-How. Under the License Agreement, BioMarin has the option to convert the exclusive license under the Licensed Patents into a co-exclusive license (co-exclusive with BioMarin) (“BioMarin Co-Exclusive Option”). Under the terms of the License Agreement, Sarepta is required to pay BioMarin an up-front payment of $15.0 million, and BioMarin will be eligible to receive up to $20.0 million from Sarepta per dystrophin gene exon (other than exon 51) targeted by one or more Products in specified regulatory milestones, as well as an additional $10.0 million milestone, payable following the regulatory approval of eteplirsen by the European Medicines Agency in the EU (“EMA”). BioMarin will also be eligible to receive $15.0 million from Sarepta upon the achievement of $650 million in sales, as well as royalties segmented by specified geographic markets, in some jurisdictions dependent on the existence of a patent, ranging from four (4) to eight (8) percentages of net sales on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis. Milestones and royalties are payable with respect to eteplirsen (an exon 51 skipping Product), casimersen (an exon 45 skipping Product), golodirsen (an exon 53 skipping Product) and other Products. For eteplirsen, casimersen and golodirsen, the royalty term will expire upon the end of 2023 in the U.S., upon September 30, 2024 in the European Union (“EU”) and no later than September 30, 2024 in other countries provided certain conditions are met. For Products other than exon 45 skipping Products, exon 51 skipping Products and exon 53 skipping Products, the royalty term will end on a country-by country basis upon expiration of granted Licensed Patents covering the applicable Product. The royalties for all Products are subject to reduction upon BioMarin’s exercise of the BioMarin Co-Exclusive Option. All royalties are subject to further potential reductions, including for generic competition and, under specified conditions, for a specified portion of payments that Sarepta may become required to pay under third-party license agreements, subject to a maximum royalty reduction. Unless earlier terminated, the License Agreement will expire upon the expiration of the last-to-expire royalty term. Either party may terminate the License Agreement in the event of the other party’s uncured material breach. BioMarin may also terminate the License Agreement on a Licensed Patent-by-Licensed Patent basis under specified circumstances relating to patent challenges by Sarepta. Settlement Agreement On July 17, 2017, Sarepta and The University of Western Australia on the one hand, and the BioMarin Parties and Academisch Ziekenhuis Leiden (“AZL”) on the other hand (collectively, the “Settlement Parties”), executed a Settlement Agreement pursuant to which all legal actions in the U.S. and certain legal actions in Europe (the “Actions”) would be stopped or withdrawn as between the Settlement Parties. Specifically, the terms of the Settlement Agreement require that existing efforts pursuing ongoing litigation and opposition proceedings would be stopped as between the Settlement Parties, and the Settlement Parties would cooperate to withdraw the Actions before the European Patent Office (except for actions involving third parties), the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the High Court of Justice of England and Wales, except for the cross-appeal of the Interlocutory Decision of the Opposition Division dated April 15, 2013 of the European Patent Office of EP 1619249B1 (“EP ‘249 Appeal”) in which Sarepta will withdraw its appeal and BioMarin/AZL will continue with its appeal with Sarepta having oversight of the continued appeal by BioMarin/AZL. Additionally, under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the Settlement Parties agree to release each other and the customers, end-users, agents, suppliers, distributors, resellers, contractors, consultants, services and partners of Sarepta or BioMarin (as applicable) from claims and damages related to (i) the patent rights controlled by the releasing party that are involved in the Actions, (ii) with respect to Sarepta and UWA, its patent rights related to the patent rights involved in the Actions, and (iii) with respect to BioMarin and AZL, all of the Licensed Patents and Licensed Know-How. Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Sarepta made an upfront payment of $20.0 million to BioMarin. University of Western Australia In April 2013, we entered into an agreement with University of Western Australia (“UWA”) under which an existing exclusive license agreement between the two parties was amended and restated (the “Amended and Restated UWA License Agreement”). The Amended and Restated UWA License Agreement grants us specific rights to the treatment of DMD by inducing the skipping of certain exons. EXONDYS 51, golodirsen and casimersen fall under the scope of the license agreement. Under the Amended and Restated UWA License Agreement, we may be required to make payments of up to $6.0 million in aggregate to UWA based on the successful achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones relating to EXONDYS 51 and up to five additional product candidates. As of the date of this Annual Report, $2.0 million of the $6.0 million development and regulatory milestone payments has been made. We may also be obligated to make payments to UWA of up to $20.0 million upon the achievement of certain sales milestones. Additionally, we may be required to pay a low-single-digit percentage royalty on net sales of -10- products covered by issued patents licensed from UWA during the term of the Amended and Restated UWA License Agreement. However, we have the option to purchase future royalties up-front. Under this option, prior to the First Amendment (defined below), we could be required to make a one-time royalty payment of $30.0 million to UWA. In June 2016 , we entered into the first amendment to the Amended and Restated UWA License Agreement (the “First Amendment”) with UWA. Under the First Amendment, we made an up-front payment of $7.0 million to UWA upon execution of the First Amendment. Under the terms of the First Amendment, UWA has waived rights to certain royalties and amended the timing of certain other royalty payments under the Amended and Restated UWA License Agreement, including lowering the one-time royalty payment that is due by us upon exercise of the option to purchase future royalties up-front. Upon exercise of the option to purchase future royalties up-front, we will be obligated to make a $23.0 million payment to UWA. Additionally, we would still be obligated to make up to $20.0 million in payments to UWA upon achievement of certain sales milestones. Currently, the latest date on which an issued patent covered by our agreement with UWA expires is November 2030 (excluding any patent term extension, supplemental protection certificate or pediatric extensions that may be available); however, patents granted from pending patent applications could result in a later expiration date. Strategic Alliances In connection with our multi-front battle against DMD and other rare neuromuscular diseases, we have entered into a number of partnering opportunities. We believe these collaborations, taken along with our own programs, represent a comprehensive approach to treating these rare neuromuscular diseases. Nationwide Children’s Hospital In December 2015, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Nationwide to acquire exclusive rights to its GALGT2 gene therapy program. This program explores the potential surrogate gene therapy approach to DMD. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the IND application for the GALGT2 gene therapy program was cleared by the FDA, and a Phase 1/2a clinical trial in individuals with DMD was initiated. In addition, in December 2016, we entered into an exclusive option agreement with Nationwide to acquire exclusive rights to their micro-dystrophin gene therapy program as well as a sponsored research agreement to conduct pre-IND research and conduct the first clinical trial with the lead micro-dystrophin gene therapy. In October 2018, we exercised our exclusive license option and an option under the sponsored research agreement and entered into an exclusive license agreement with Nationwide to acquire exclusive rights to their micro-dystrophin gene therapy program. On October 3, 2018, Nationwide presented positive updated results from our Phase 1/2a clinical trial testing SRP-9001 in four individuals with DMD enrolled in the trial. Furthermore, in October 2018, we entered into an exclusive option agreement with Nationwide to acquire exclusive rights to their NT-3 gene therapy program for the treatment of certain CMT neuropathy subtypes, including CMT Type 1A. The option agreement contains pre-determined economic terms for the exclusive license to be entered into upon us exercising our option. The clinical trial to test NT-3 gene therapy is planned to commence dosing in 2019 for CMT type 1A, pending regulatory feedback. Lysogene In October 2018, we entered into a license agreement with Lysogene, a gene therapy company focused on the treatment of orphan diseases of the CNS, for the development of a gene therapy, LYS-SAF302, to treat MPS IIIA. Concomitantly, we also entered into an option with Lysogene to acquire an exclusive license to an additional CNS-targeted gene therapy candidate. Lysogene is responsible for completion of the pivotal trial for LYS-SAF302. We have exclusive commercial rights to LYS-SAF302 and exclusive option rights for the additional CNS-targeted gene therapy program in the United States and all territories outside of Europe, and Lysogene will retain exclusive commercial rights to each program in Europe. We will be responsible for global manufacturing of LYS-SAF302 and will supply Lysogene for its territory. If all milestones are met, we may be required to pay up to $130.8 million in development and commercial milestones and tiered royalties upon commercialization. Lacerta In August 2018, we entered into a license and option agreement with Lacerta, a gene therapy company using a constellation of proprietary AAV vector technologies to develop treatments for CNS-targeted and lysosomal storage diseases. Under this agreement, we have an exclusive license to Lacerta’s gene therapy candidate for Pompe disease and exclusive options to obtain an exclusive license for two additional gene therapy candidates. Lacerta will manage the majority of pre-clinical development for the Pompe candidate while we will lead clinical development and commercialization. We will owe development and sales-based milestones to Lacerta and pay single-digit royalties on net sales. -11- Duke University In October 2017, we entered into a sponsored research and exclusive option agreement with Duke University, granting us an exclusive option to an exclusive license to intellectual property and technology related to certain CRISPR/Cas9 technology developed in the laboratory of Charles A. Gersbach, Ph.D. The underlying premise of Dr. Gersbach’s approach is to restore dystrophin expression by removing or “excising” exons from the dystrophin gene. This includes a strategy to excise exons potentially enabling treatment for a majority of the DMD patient population. Genethon In May 2017, we entered into a gene therapy research collaboration and option agreement with Genethon to jointly develop micro-dystrophin gene therapy products for the treatment of DMD. Under the terms of the collaboration, Genethon is responsible for the early development work, and we have the option to co-develop Genethon’s micro-dystrophin program, which includes exclusive U.S. commercial rights. Charley’s Fund Agreement In October 2007, Charley’s Fund, Inc. (“Charley’s Fund”), a nonprofit organization that funds drug development and discovery initiatives specific to DMD, awarded us a research grant of approximately $2.5 million and, in May 2009, the grant authorization was increased to a total of $5.0 million. Pursuant to the related sponsored research agreement, the grant was provided to support the development of product candidates related to exon 50 skipping using our proprietary exon-skipping technologies. As of December 31, 2017, Charley’s Fund had made payments of approximately $3.4 million to us and no payments have been made to us since this date. Revenue associated with this research and development arrangement is recognized based on the proportional performance method. To date, we have recognized approximately $0.1 million as revenue. We have deferred $3.3 million of previous receipts, which are anticipated to be recognized as revenue upon resolution of outstanding performance obligations. Previously, we noted unexpected toxicology findings in the kidney as part of our series of pre-clinical trials for AVI-5038, our PMO-based candidate designed for the treatment of individuals with DMD who have an error in the gene coding for dystrophin that can be treated by skipping exon 50. We have conducted additional pre-clinical trials and have not alleviated the toxicity problem. Pursuant to the terms of our agreement with Charley’s Fund, the receipt of additional funds is tied to the satisfaction of certain clinical milestones. Because of the toxicity issues with AVI-5038, satisfaction of the additional milestones under the agreement is unlikely and we do not expect to receive any additional funds from Charley’s Fund. Summit On October 3, 2016, we entered into an exclusive Collaboration and License Agreement (the “Collaboration Agreement”) with (Oxford) Ltd. (“Summit”), which grants us the exclusive right to commercialize products in Summit’s utrophin modulator pipeline in the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Turkey and the Commonwealth of Independent States. On June 27, 2018, Summit announced that it decided to discontinue the development of ezutromid after reviewing the top-line results from its Phase 2 trial. Patents and Proprietary Rights Our success depends in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain exclusivity for our product, product candidates and platform technologies. We typically rely on a combination of patent protection and regulatory exclusivity to maintain exclusivity for our product and product candidates, whereas exclusivity for our platform technologies is generally based on patent protection and trade secret protection. In addition to patent protection, regulatory exclusivity, and trade secret protection, we also protect our product, product candidates and platform technologies with copyrights, trademarks, and contractual protections. We actively seek patent protection for our product candidates and certain of our proprietary technologies by filing patent applications in the U.S. and other countries as appropriate. These patent applications are directed to various inventions, including, but not limited to, active ingredients, pharmaceutical formulations, methods of use, and manufacturing methods. In addition, we actively acquire exclusive rights to third party patents and patent applications to protect our in-licensed product candidates and corresponding platform technologies. We do not have patents or patent applications in every jurisdiction where there is a potential commercial market for our product candidates. For each of our programs, our decision to seek patent protection in specific foreign markets, in addition to the U.S., is based on many factors, including: • our available resources; • the number and types of patents already filed or pending; -12- • the likelihood of success of the product candidate; • the size of the commercial market; • the presence of a potential competitor in the market; and • whether the legal authorities in the market effectively enforce patent rights. We continually evaluate our patent portfolio and patent strategy and believe our owned and licensed patents and patent applications provide us with a competitive advantage; however, if markets where we do not have patents or patent applications become commercially important, our business may be adversely affected. A discussion of certain risks and uncertainties that may affect our patent position, regulatory exclusivities and other proprietary rights is set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors included in this report, and a discussion of legal proceedings related to the key patents protecting our product and product candidates is set forth below in the footnotes that immediately below the tables in this section. Certain of our product candidates are in therapeutic areas that have been the subject of many years of extensive research and development by academic organizations and third parties who may control patents or other intellectual property that they might assert against us, should one or more of our product candidates in these therapeutic areas succeed in obtaining regulatory approval and thereafter be commercialized. We continually evaluate the intellectual property rights of others in these areas in order to determine whether a claim of infringement may be made by others against us. Should we determine that a third party has intellectual property rights that could impact our ability to freely market a compound, we consider a number of factors in determining how best to prepare for the commercialization of any such product candidate. In making this determination we consider, among other things, the stage of development of our product candidate, the anticipated date of first regulatory approval, whether we believe the intellectual property rights of others are valid, whether we believe we infringe the intellectual property rights of others, whether a license is available upon commercially reasonable terms, whether we will seek to challenge the intellectual property rights of others, the term of the rights, and the likelihood of and liability resulting from an adverse outcome should we be found to infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Currently, U.S. patents, as well as most foreign patents, are generally effective for 20 years from the date the earliest regular application was filed. In some countries, the patent term may be extended to recapture a portion of the term lost during regulatory review of the claimed therapeutic. For example, in the U.S., under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may be eligible for patent term extension (for up to 5 years, but not beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval) as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. In the U.S., only one patent may be extended for any product based on FDA delay. In addition to patent term extension, patents in the U.S. may be granted additional term due to delays at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) during prosecution of a patent application. We actively strive to maximize the potential for patent protection for our product and product candidates in accordance with the law. Key Patents & Regulatory Exclusivities Our product candidates and our technologies are primarily protected by composition of matter and use patents and patent applications. A summary of granted composition of matter and/or use patents that we own or control in the U.S. and Europe, which cover our product and late-stage clinical product candidates, is provided below. To the extent the product or product candidate indicated above the tables that immediately follow the name of such product is covered by a patent that is licensed to Sarepta, we may owe milestones and/or royalties to the indicated licensor in connection with the development and/or commercial sale of the product or product candidate. -13- Eteplirsen Patent Number Country/Region* Patent Type Expiration Date** Owner/Licensor (if not Sarepta) U.S. 9,416,361 United States Composition of Matter May 4, 2021 Sarepta U.S. 7,960,541 1 United States Composition of Matter June 28, 2025 UWA U.S. 8,486,907 2 United States Methods of Use June 28, 2025 UWA U.S. 9,018,368 United States Composition of Matter June 28, 2025 UWA U.S. 7,807,816 1 United States Composition of Matter February 23, 2026 UWA U.S. 9,243,245 3 United States Methods of Use October 27, 2028 BioMarin/AZL U.S. 9,506,058 United States Methods of Use March 14, 2034 Sarepta 1 Previously involved in U.S. Patent Interference No. 106,008.

In addition to the foregoing composition of matter and method of use patents that protect eteplirsen, casimersen and golodirsen, we either solely own or exclusively license from UWA, BioMarin or AZL patents and patent applications in the U.S. and in major foreign markets that provide additional protection for eteplirsen, casimersen, and golodirsen, which cover the composition of matter, preparation and/or uses of the product and product candidates. These patents, and patent applications, if granted, would expire through 2038, such expiration dates not accounting for any patent term extension, patent term adjustment, supplemental protection certificate or pediatric extensions that may be available. Platform Technologies We separately own patents and patent applications in the U.S. and in major foreign markets that cover our proprietary PMO-based platform technologies (e.g., PPMO, PMOplus ® , PMO-X ® ). These patents, and patent applications, if granted, expire through 2038, such expiration dates not accounting for any patent term extension, supplemental protection certificate or pediatric extensions that may be available. Trademarks Our trademarks are important to us and are generally filed to protect our corporate brand, our products and platform technologies. We typically file trademark applications and pursue their registration in the U.S., Europe and other markets in which we anticipate using such trademarks. We are the owner of multiple federal trademark registrations in the U.S. including, but not limited to, Sarepta ® , Sarepta Therapeutics ® , the Sarepta Therapeutics logo, EXONDYS ® , and EXONDYS 51 ® . In addition, we have multiple pending trademark applications in the U.S. and in major foreign markets. Trademark protection varies in accordance with local law, -15- and continues in some countries as long as the trademark is used and in other countries as long as the trademark is registered. Trademark registrations generally are for fixed but renewable terms. Government Regulation The testing, manufacturing, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, exportation and marketing of our products are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S. and in other countries. In the U.S., the FDA, under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations, regulates pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending marketing applications, withdrawal of approval of approved products, warning letters, untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, civil penalties and/or criminal prosecution. U.S. Drug Approval Process To obtain FDA approval of a product candidate, we must, among other things, submit clinical data providing substantial evidence of safety and efficacy of the product for its intended use, as well as detailed information on product composition, its manufacture and controls and proposed labeling. The testing and collection of data and the preparation of necessary applications are expensive and time-consuming. The FDA may not act quickly or favorably in reviewing these applications, and we may encounter significant difficulties or costs in our efforts to obtain FDA approvals that could delay or preclude us from marketing our products. The steps required before a drug may be approved for marketing in the U.S. generally include the following: • pre-clinical laboratory tests and animal toxicity testing; • submission of an IND for conducting human clinical testing to the FDA, which must become effective before human clinical trials commence; • adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug product for each indication, including controlled studies or comparison of treated group from clinical trials to data from natural history data or studies; • submission of a complete and compliant marketing application containing chemistry, manufacturing and control information for the drug substance and drug product, reports of nonclinical and clinical trials, product labeling and administrative information; • satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the commercial manufacturing facilities at which the drug substance and drug product are made to assess compliance with cGMP; • satisfactory FDA audit of the clinical trial site(s) that generated the pivotal safety and efficacy data included in the marketing application and also potentially the nonclinical trial site(s) in the form of pre-approval inspections; and • FDA review and approval of the marketing application. Pre-clinical trials may include laboratory evaluations of the product chemistry, pharmacology, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the pharmacokinetics, metabolism, bio-distribution, elimination and toxicity of the product candidate. The conduct of the pre-clinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with federal regulations and requirements. The results of the pre-clinical trials, manufacturing information, analytical data and a proposed first in human clinical trial protocol are submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may be initiated. The IND will become effective approximately 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions about the supportive data, or the study design, particularly regarding potential safety issues with conducting the clinical trial as described in the protocol. In this situation, the trials are placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns before clinical trials can proceed. Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patient participants under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the study, the administration of the investigational product, study procedures, parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as a submission to the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”) requirements and federal and state laws and regulations protecting study subjects. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) at or servicing each institution in which the clinical trial will be conducted. The IRB will consider, among other things, rationale for conducting the trial, clinical trial design, participant informed consent, ethical factors, the safety and rights of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution. The FDA can temporarily or permanently halt a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial -16- subjects. The IRB may also require the clinical trial at a particular site be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with GCP or the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions. Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential drug development phases (Phases 1, 2 and 3) prior to approval, and a portion of these phases may overlap. A fourth post-approval phase (Phase 4) may include additional clinical trials. A general description of clinical trials conducted in each phase of development is provided below. However, the number of study subjects involved in each phase of drug development for rare diseases can be significantly less than typically expected for more common diseases with larger patient populations: • Phase 1. Phase 1 clinical trials involve the initial introduction of the drug into human subjects. These studies are usually designed to determine the safety of single and multiple doses of the compound and determine any dose limiting toxicities or intolerance, as well as the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of the drug in humans. Phase 1 studies usually involve less than 100 subjects and are conducted in healthy adult volunteers, unless it is unethical to administer the study drug to healthy volunteers, in which case they are tested in patients. • Phase 2. Phase 2 clinical trials are usually conducted in a limited patient population to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the drug for a specific indication to determine optimal dosage and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks. Phase 2 studies usually involve patients with the disease under investigation and may vary in size from several dozen to several hundred. • Phase 3. If an investigational drug is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in early phase studies, larger Phase 3 clinical trials are conducted to confirm clinical efficacy, dosage and safety in the intended patient population, which may involve geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials which establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for a specific indication are required for approval of a marketing application. Phase 3 studies usually include several hundred to several thousand patients for larger, non-orphan drug indications/diseases. However, clinical trials for rare or orphan diseases generally have fewer patients due to their lower prevalence. For these orphan diseases, a company may also try to demonstrate efficacy and safety by comparing treated patients in clinical trials to untreated patients participating in placebo-controlled clinical trials or to observational natural history studies. • Phase 4. Phase 4 trials are clinical trials conducted after the FDA has approved a product for marketing. Typically there are two forms of Phase 4 trials: those that are conducted to fulfill mandatory conditions of product approval and those that are voluntarily conducted to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. The mandatory studies are used to confirm clinical benefit in the case of drugs approved under the accelerated approval regulations or to provide additional clinical safety or efficacy data for “full” approvals. Failure to promptly conduct and complete mandatory Phase 4 clinical trials could result in withdrawal of approval for products approved under accelerated approval regulations. A company seeking marketing approval for a new drug in the U.S. must submit the results of the pre-clinical and clinical trials to the FDA in the form of a marketing application, together with, among other things, detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product candidate and proposed labeling, including payment of a user fee for FDA review of the application. The user fee is waived for an application for a product intended to treat an Orphan Indication. The FDA assesses all submitted marketing applications for completeness before it accepts them for filing. In some cases, the FDA may request additional information before accepting a marketing application for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the marketing application. Applications receive either standard or priority review. Under the current goals mandated under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (the “PDUFA”), the FDA has ten months in which to complete its initial review of a standard marketing application and respond to the applicant, and six months for a priority marketing application. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard or priority marketing applications. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the marketing application sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date. The FDA may refer an application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. Though the FDA is not bound by such recommendations, it considers them carefully when making decisions. If the FDA’s evaluations of the marketing application and the clinical and manufacturing procedures and facilities are favorable, the FDA may issue an approval letter. If the FDA finds deficiencies in the marketing application, it may issue a complete response letter, which defines the conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the marketing application. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will issue an approval letter, authorizing commercial marketing of the drug. Sponsors that receive a complete response letter may submit to the FDA information that represents a complete response to the issues identified by the FDA. Resubmissions by the marketing application sponsor in response to a complete response letter trigger new review periods of varying length (typically two to six months) based on the content of the resubmission. If the FDA’s evaluation of the marketing application and the commercial manufacturing procedures and facilities is not favorable, the FDA may not approve the marketing application. -17- A sponsor may also seek designation of its drug candidates under programs designed to accelerate the FDA’s review and potential approval of marketing application s. For instance, a sponsor may seek FDA designation of a drug candidate as a “fast track product.” Fast track products are those products intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. If fast track designation is obtained, the FDA may initiate early and frequent communication an d begin reviewing sections of a marketing application before the application is complete. This “rolling review” is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the remaining information. Eteplirsen was granted fast track status in 2007. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (“FDASIA”) enacted and signed into law in 2012 amended the criteria for the fast track and accelerated approval pathways and, as a result, the pathways now share many common eligibility criteria. FDASIA provides both the sponsor companies and the FDA with greater flexibility and expedited regulatory mechanisms. The statute clarifies that a fast track product may be approved pursuant to an accelerated approval (Subpart – H) or under the traditional approval process. In addition, FDASIA codified the accelerated approval pathway as separate and apart from the fast track pathway, meaning that for drugs to be eligible for accelerated approval, they do not need to be designated under the fast track pathway. FDASIA reinforces the FDA’s authority to grant accelerated approval of a drug that treats a serious condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies and demonstrates an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality (“IMM”) that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit (i.e., an intermediate clinical endpoint). Approvals of this kind typically include requirements for appropriate post-approval Phase 4 clinical trials to confirm clinical benefit. FDASIA retains this requirement and further requires those studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. Additionally, FDASIA established a new, expedited regulatory mechanism referred to as breakthrough therapy designation. Breakthrough therapy designation, fast track, and accelerated approval are not mutually exclusive and are meant to serve different purposes. The breakthrough therapy designation is focused on expediting the development and review process and by itself does not create an alternate ground for product approval. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of a drug candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the drug is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA issued guidance entitled “Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions––Drugs and Biologics” in May 2014. Finally, if a drug candidate demonstrates a significant benefit over existing therapy, it may be eligible for priority review, which means it will be reviewed within a six-month timeframe from the date a complete marketing application is accepted for filing. A Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (“RMAT”) designation is also designed to accelerate approval for regenerative advanced therapies such as our gene therapy product candidates, but the exact mechanisms have not yet been announced by FDA. We cannot be sure that any of our drug candidates will qualify for any of these expedited development, review and approval programs, or that, if a drug does qualify, that the product candidates will be approved, will be accepted as part of any such program or that the review time will be shorter than a standard review. Holders of an approved marketing application are required to: • report serious adverse drug reactions to the FDA; • submit annual and periodic reports summarizing product information and safety data; • comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling; • continue to have quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP after approval; and • conduct any post-marketing study designated as a required condition of the marketing application approval. The FDA periodically inspects the sponsor’s records related to safety reporting and/or manufacturing; this latter effort includes assessment of compliance with cGMP. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved marketing application, including withdrawal of the product from the market. Foreign Regulatory Requirements We are pursuing regulatory approval of eteplirsen in jurisdictions outside of the U.S. In November 2016, we submitted a marketing authorization application (“MAA”) for eteplirsen to the EMA and the application was validated in December 2016. As we -18- announced on June 1, 2018, the CHMP of the EMA adopted a negative opinion for eteplirsen. In September 2018, the CHMP of the EMA confirmed its negative opinion for eteplirsen, and the European Commission adopted the CHMP opinion in December 2018. We plan to seek follow up EMA scientific advice in 2019 to explore a potential approach for EMA approval of eteplirsen. We have initiated key activities in support of the potential launch of eteplirsen in the EU, such as building out commercial infrastructure and scaling-up manufacturing. As of the date of this Annual Report, EXONDYS 51 has only been approved for sale and marketing in the U.S. by the FDA and in Israel by the Israeli Ministry of Health . Thus, in addition to regulations in the U.S., our business is subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Irrespective of whether it is an FDA approved drug or an investigational drug, approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries are required before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. For example, in the EU, the conduct of clinical trials is governed by the currently applicable Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC concerning conduct of clinical trials in the EU and the Directive 2005/28/EC laying down the principles and guidelines on GCP, a system for the approval of clinical trials that has been implemented through national legislation in the member states in the EU. Under this system, a sponsor must obtain approval from the competent national authority of an EU member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted, or in multiple member states if the clinical trial is to be conducted in a number of countries. Furthermore, the sponsor may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. The Clinical Trials Application (“CTA”) must include the supporting information prescribed by Directive 2001/20/EC and Directive 2005/28/EC, corresponding national laws of the member states, and as further detailed in the applicable guidance documents. In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive. The new Clinical Trials Regulation has come into force, but will come into application in all EU Member States in October 2018 without the need for any national implementing legislation. The new regulation provides an overhaul of the system to ensure greater consistency in the approval of clinical trials with the highest standards of patient safety in the EU. Specifically, the new legislation seeks to simplify and streamline approval. Under the new coordinated procedure for the approval, the sponsor of a clinical trial is required to submit a single application to a reporting EU Member State. The reporting Member State will consult and coordinate with all other Member States in which the clinical trial is planned to be conducted (concerned Member States). If the application is rejected, it can be amended and resubmitted through a central EU Portal. If an approval is issued, the sponsor can start the clinical trial in all concerned Member States. However, a concerned Member State can in certain cases declare an “opt-out” from the approval. In such a case, the clinical trial cannot be conducted in those Member State(s). The Clinical Trials Regulation also aims to streamline and simplify the rules on safety reporting for clinical trials. In order to obtain marketing authorization for a medicinal product in the EU, applicants are required to submit an MAA to either the national Competent Authorities or the EMA for the Centralized authorization procedures, using the ICH Common Technical Document (“CTD”). Applicants are required to demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicinal product in the application for marketing authorization. This includes the requirement to conduct human clinical trials to generate the necessary clinical data. Submission of data in compliance with an agreed Pediatric Investigation Plan (“PIP”) is essential for the validation or acceptance of an MAA for review. Medicinal products are authorized in the EU through one of several different procedures, either by the national competent authorities of the EU Member States (through the decentralized, mutual recognition, or national procedures), or through the centralized authorization procedure administered by the EMA. Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council lays down the centralized procedure for the authorization of medicinal products, for which there is a single application, a single evaluation and a single approval allowing direct access to the single market of the EU. Approval via the Centralized Procedure is a two-step process whereby the CHMP first adopts an “Opinion” recommending grant of a marketing authorization following a review of the submitted data to inform an assessment of benefit/risk. The adopted Opinion can be positive or negative. A positive CHMP opinion is followed by European Commission (“EC”) binding decision to grant a marketing authorization. The marketing authorization is valid throughout the EU and is automatically recognized in three of the four European Free Trade Association states (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). These countries collectively belong to the European Economic Area. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA leading to the CHMP opinion is 210 days (discounting procedural clock-stops) from receipt of a valid application for marketing authorization. This time period to complete the scientific review is generally longer than the 210 days as “clock stops” are required to respond to additional written or oral information requested by the EMA. Following a positive CHMP opinion, the EU Commission has 67 days to issue the EC Decision (i.e. the marketing authorization). Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 defines the scope and eligibility of applications for evaluation under the centralized procedure through which medicinal products must (""mandatory scope"") or may (""optional scope"" or ""Generic/Hybrid"") be authorized by the Community. The centralized procedure is compulsory for certain medicinal products, including medicinal products derived from biotechnological processes, orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy medicinal products and products indicated for the treatment of certain diseases including treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. It is optional for new active substances and products that can demonstrate a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, where approval would be in the interest of public health. Our portfolio of innovative orphan products for neurodegenerative diseases is subject to the mandatory centralized procedure. -19- Accelerated evaluation may be granted in exceptional cases, following a justified request from the applicant, when a medicinal product is of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. CHMP determines what constitutes a major public interest on a case by case basis. Justifications must include the major benefits expected and present the arguments to support the claim that the medicinal product introduces new methods of therapy or improves on existing methods, thereby addressing, to a significant extent, the greater unmet needs for maintaining and improving public health. During an accelerated assessment, the opinion of the CHMP is given, in principle, within 150 days. The EU Commission Decision is then issued according to the timetable described above. Innovative medicinal products authorized in the EU on the basis of a full stand-alone MAA consisting of pharmaceutical and pre-clinical testing results and clinical trial data (as opposed to an application for a generic marketing authorization that relies on the results of pre-clinical and clinical trials available in the marketing authorization dossier for another, previously approved, reference medicinal product) are treated as reference medicinal products and accordingly entitled to eight years’ data exclusivity. During this period, applicants for approval of generics of these innovative products cannot reference or rely upon data contained in the marketing authorization dossier submitted for the innovative medicinal product. Even if the generic product is approved, it cannot be placed on the market until the full 10-year period of market protection has elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference medicinal product. This period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the MA holder for the innovative product obtains an authorization for new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies or as the result of significant pre-clinical or clinical trials. In the EU, orphan medicinal product designation is considered by the EMA for drugs intended to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or very serious condition with a prevalence of no more than 5 in 10,000 people in the EU. In addition, the sponsor is required to demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition that has been authorized in the EU or if such method exists, the medicinal product is of significant benefit to those affected by the condition as compared to approved methods. Medicinal products developed for treating serious and chronic conditions would likely not be marketed without incentives due to low market return on the sponsor’s development investment. As such, they may also be eligible for an EU orphan drug designation. Benefits of being granted orphan designation are significant, including up to ten years of market exclusivity. During this ten-year period, the EMA may not accept a new marketing application for a similar medicinal product for the same therapeutic indication as the approved orphan medicinal product. Pursuant to Regulation (EC) 1901/2006 on medicinal products for pediatric use, the 10-year orphan market exclusivity can be extended to a maximum period of 12 years on the satisfactory completion of all the key elements of the agreed PIP. We have been granted orphan drug designation for eteplirsen in the EU. Similar to the U.S., marketing authorization holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA and/or the national competent authorities of the EU Member States. This oversight applies both before and after the granting of manufacturing and marketing authorizations. It includes compliance with EU GMP and GDP rules in relation to such activities as distribution, importing and exporting of medicinal products, rules governing conduct of pharmacovigilance and requirements governing advertising, promotion and sale of medicinal products. Failure to comply with the EU Member State laws implementing the EU Community Code on medicinal products, and EU rules governing the promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices, with the EU Member State laws that apply to the promotion of medicinal products, statutory health insurance, bribery and anti-corruption or with other applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the relevant EU Member State authorities. This may include any of the following: fines, imprisonment, orders forfeiting products or prohibiting or suspending their supply to the market, orders to suspend, vary, or withdraw the marketing authorization or requiring the manufacturer to issue public warnings, or to conduct a product recall. The collection and use of personal health data and other personal information in the EU is governed by the provisions of the Data Protection Directive as implemented into national laws by the EU Member States. This Directive imposes a number of strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer patient data, including sensitive health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. There is, moreover, a growing trend towards imposition of an obligation of public disclosure of clinical trial data in the EU, which adds to the complexity of obligations relating to the processing of health data from clinical trials. Such public disclosure obligations are provided in the new EU Clinical Trials Regulation, EMA disclosure initiatives, and voluntary commitments by industry. The Data Protection Directive also includes requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals prior to processing their personal data or personal health data, notification of data processing obligations to the competent national data protection authorities and the security and confidentiality of the personal data. The Data Protection Directive also prohibits the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the EU Member States that are not considered by the EU to provide an adequate level of data protection. These countries include the U.S. Failure to comply with the requirements of the Data Protection Directive and the related national data protection laws of the EU Member States may result in fines and other administrative penalties. Data protection authorities from the different EU Member States may interpret the EU Data Protection Directive and national laws differently, which adds to the complexity of processing personal data in the EU -20- Guidance developed at both EU level and at national level in individual EU Member States concerning implementation and compliance practices are often updated or otherwise revised. In December 2015, a proposal for an EU General Data Protection Regulation, intended to replace the current EU Data Protection Directive, was agreed between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission. The EU General Data Protection Regulation, which was officially adopted in April 2016 and will be applicable in May 2018, will introduce new data protection requirements in the EU, as well as substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules. The EU General Data Protection Regulation will increase our responsibility and liability in relation to any personal data that we process, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms to ensure compliance with the new EU data protection rules. The approval process in other countries outside the U.S. and the EU varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for the FDA approval. In addition, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement for market access vary greatly from country to country. In all cases, clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. Data and Market Exclusivities In addition to patent exclusivities, the FDA and certain other foreign health authorities may grant data or market exclusivity for a newly approved chemical entity or biologic, which runs in parallel to any patent protection. Regulatory data protection or exclusivity prevents a potential generic competitor from relying on clinical trial data generated by the sponsor when establishing the safety and efficacy of its competing product. Market exclusivity prohibits any marketing of the same drug for the same indication. In the U.S., the FDA will generally grant a NCE that is the subject of a NDA with five years of regulatory data exclusivity, during which time a competitor generally may not submit an application to the FDA based on a sponsor’s clinical data. For a newly approved biologic that is the subject of a BLA, the FDA will generally grant 12 years of market exclusivity, during which time a competitor may not market the same drug for the same indication. In addition, the FDA may provide six months of pediatric exclusivity to a sponsor of a marketing application, if the sponsor conducted a pediatric study or studies of a product. This process is applied to products developed for adult use and is initiated by the FDA as a written request for pediatric studies that applies to a sponsor’s product. If the sponsor conducts qualifying studies and the studies are accepted by the FDA, then an additional six months of pediatric exclusivity will be added to previously granted exclusivity, such as orphan drug exclusivity and NCE exclusivity, as well as certain patent-based exclusivities. Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity In the U.S., the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that drug. An orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. An orphan drug designation does not shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. The approval of an orphan designation request does not alter the regulatory requirements and process for obtaining marketing approval. Safety and efficacy of a compound must be established through adequate and well-controlled studies. If a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives FDA approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is generally entitled to an orphan drug exclusivity period, which means the FDA may not grant approval to any other application to market the same chemical entity for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as where an alternative product demonstrates clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. In addition, holders of exclusivity for orphan drugs are expected to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of their orphan drugs to meet the needs of patients. Failure to do so could result in the withdrawal of orphan exclusivity for the drug. Competitors may receive approval of different drugs or biologics for the indications for which a prior approved orphan drug has exclusivity. In Europe, the EMA may grant orphan status to product candidates thereby providing such product candidates with ten years of marketing exclusivity, meaning that another application for marketing authorization of a later, similar medicinal product for the same therapeutic indication will generally not be approved in Europe during that time period. Expanded / Early Access In certain countries, drug products approved in the U.S. or the EU can be accessed by patients before the drug has obtained marketing approval in such country. There are various forms of this access including, but not limited to, the actual purchase of product by the purchaser, which is often times the government for patients, on a named patient basis, and providing the product free of charge -21- on a named patient basis for compassionate use. Each country has its own laws and regulations that apply to these forms of access and the extent and nature of such laws and regulations vary by country. For example, in 2018, the so-called Right to Try Act became law in the United States. The law, among other things, allows eligible patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to such eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act. We have initiated an EAP for eteplirsen in select countries in Europe, North America, South America and Asia where it currently has not been approved. The EAP provides a mechanism through which physicians can prescribe eteplirsen, within their professional responsibility, to patients who meet pre-specified medical and other criteria and can secure funding. We have commenced shipments through the EAP and continue to expand the EAP to include more countries. In addition, we contracted with third party distributors and service providers to distribute eteplirsen in certain areas outside the U.S., such as Brazil and certain countries in the Middle East, on a named patient basis. Other Regulatory Requirements In addition to regulations enforced by the FDA and foreign authorities relating to the clinical development and marketing of products, we are or may become subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and potential future foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations. Although we believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws that apply to us, we cannot predict whether new regulatory restrictions will be imposed by state or federal regulators and agencies or whether existing laws and regulations will adversely affect us in the future. Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws We are subject to various federal, state and local laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, including anti-kickback and false claims laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by crime or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, and/or exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). Federal and state authorities are paying increased attention to enforcement of these laws within the pharmaceutical industry, and private individuals have been active in alleging violations of the laws and bringing suits on behalf of the government under the federal False Claims Act (“FCA”). Violations of international fraud and abuse laws could result in similar penalties, including exclusion from participation in health programs outside the U.S. If we were subject to allegations concerning, or were convicted of violating, these laws, our business could be harmed. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute generally prohibits, among other things, a pharmaceutical manufacturer from directly or indirectly soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying any remuneration in cash or in kind where one purpose is either to induce the referral of an individual for, or the purchase or prescription of a particular drug that is payable by a federal health care program, including Medicare or Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or a specific intent to violate the statute. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute can result in exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs as well as civil and criminal fines and penalties of up to $100,000 per violation and three times the amount of the unlawful remuneration. A claim arising from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute also constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. A new federal anti-kickback statute enacted in 2018 prohibits certain payments related to referrals of patients to certain providers (such as clinical laboratories) and applies to services reimbursed by private health plans as well as government health care programs. Federal and state false claims laws generally prohibit anyone from knowingly and willfully, among other activities, presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for drugs or services that are false or fraudulent (which may include claims for services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary services). False or fraudulent claims for purposes of the FCA carry fines and civil penalties for violations ranging from $11,181 to $22,363 for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages sustained by the federal government and, may provide the basis for exclusion from federally funded healthcare programs. There is also a criminal FCA statute by which individuals or entities that submit false claims can face criminal penalties. In addition, under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General has the authority to exclude from participation in federal health care programs or to impose civil penalties against any person who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, certain false or otherwise improper claims. Our activities relating to the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. The majority of states also have anti-kickback, false claims, and similar fraud and abuse laws and although the specific provisions of these laws vary, their scope is generally broad, and there may not be regulations, guidance or court decisions that apply -22- the laws to particular industry practices. There is therefore a possibility that our practices might be challenged under the anti-kickback statutes or similar laws. Laws and regulations have also been enacted by the federal government and various states to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers. The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers; require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government; and/or require disclosure to the government and/or public of financial interactions (so-called “sunshine laws”). State laws may also require disclosure of pharmaceutical pricing information and marketing expenditures. Manufacturers must also submit information to the FDA on the identity and quantity of drug samples requested and distributed by a manufacturer during each year. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our activities could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent federal and state laws and regulations. Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement Our first commercial product in the U.S., EXONDYS 51, was granted accelerated approval by the FDA on September 19, 2016. We have an ongoing dialogue with payors globally with the goal of obtaining broad coverage for EXONDYS 51. To date, payors’ policies on coverage for EXONDYS 51 have varied widely, including policies that allow broad coverage per the EXONDYS 51 prescribing information, policies that provide limited coverage, to policies that have denied coverage. The majority of payors have policies that provide for case-by-case coverage or restricted coverage. Our revenue depends, in part, upon the extent to which payors provide coverage for EXONDYS 51 and the amount that payors, including government authorities or programs, private health insurers and other organizations, reimburse patients and healthcare providers for the cost of EXONDYS 51. Third Party Reimbursement and Pricing in the U.S. Commercial Insurance. Coverage and reimbursement of our EXONDYS 51 varies from commercial payor to commercial payor. Many commercial payors, such as managed care plans, manage access to FDA approved products, and may use drug formularies and medical policies (which may include specific coverage requirements such as prior authorization, re-authorization and achieving performance metrics under value-based contracts) to control utilization. Exclusion from or restriction in coverage can reduce product usage. Medicaid . Our product EXONDYS 51 is eligible to be reimbursed by Medicaid. Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that is administered by the states for low income and disabled beneficiaries. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, participating manufacturers are required to pay a rebate for each unit of product reimbursed under the state Medicaid programs. The amount of the rebate for each product is set by law and may be subject to an additional discount if certain pricing increases more than inflation. State Medicaid programs and Medicaid managed care plans can seek additional “supplemental” rebates from manufacturers in connections with favorable positioning on formularies. Medicare . Medicare is a federal program that is administered by the federal government that covers individuals age 65 and over as well as those with certain disabilities. Our product EXONDYS 51 is eligible for reimbursement under Medicare Part B. Medicare Part B generally covers drugs that must be administered by physicians. Medicare Part B pays for such drugs under a payment methodology based on the average sales price (“ASP”) of the drugs. Reimbursement levels and reimbursement methodologies have come under scrutiny and may be subject to change. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) are also increasingly bundling drug reimbursement into procedure costs, which can severely decrease the reimbursement rates for some manufacturers’ drugs. Federal Purchasers . Drug products are subject to discounted pricing when purchased by federal agencies via the Federal Supply Schedule (“FSS”). FSS participation is required for a drug product to be covered and reimbursed by certain federal agencies and for coverage under Medicaid, Medicare Part B and the Public Health Service (“PHS”) 340B drug pricing program. FSS pricing is negotiated periodically with the Department of Veterans Affairs. FSS pricing is intended not to exceed the price that a manufacturer charges its most-favored non-federal customer for its product. In addition, prices for drugs purchased by the Veterans Administration, Department of Defense (including drugs purchased by military personnel and dependents through the TRICARE retail pharmacy program), Coast Guard, and PHS are subject to a cap on pricing (known as the “federal ceiling price”) and may be subject to an additional discount if pricing increases more than the rate of inflation. PHS 340B Drug Pricing Program . To maintain coverage of drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and Medicare Part B, manufacturers are required to extend discounts to certain purchasers under the PHS 340B drug pricing program. Purchasers eligible for discounts include hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of financially needy patients, community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the PHS. -23- Healthcare and Other Reform. In the U.S., federal and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reform delivery of, or payment for, health care, which include initiatives to reduce the cost of healthcare. For example, in March 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the Healthcare Reform Act, which expanded health care coverage through Medicaid expansion , implemented the “ individual mandate ” for health insurance coverage (by imposing a tax penalty on individuals who did not obtain insurance) and changed the coverage and reimbursement of drug products under government healthcare programs. Under the Trump administration, there have been ongoing efforts to modify or repeal all or certain provisions of the Healthcare Reform Act. Tax reform legislation was enacted at the end of 2017 that includes provisions that will affect healthcare insurance coverage and payment, such as the elimination of the tax penalty for individuals who do not maintain sufficient health insurance coverage beginning in 2019. In a May 2018 report, the Congressional Budget Office estimate d that , compared to 2018, the number of uninsured will increase by 3 million in 2019 and 6 million in 202 8, in part due to the elimination of the individual mandate. The Healthcare Reform Act has also been subject to judicial challenge. In December 2018, a federal district court judge, in a challenge brought by a number of state attorneys general, found the Healthcare Reform Act unconstitutional in its entirety because once Congress repealed the “individual mandate” provision, there was no longer a basis to rely on Congressional taxing authority to support enactment of the law. The court reasoned that the “individual mandate” was not severable from the rest of the Healthcare Reform Act and found the entire Healthcare Reform Act was an unconstitutional exercise of Congressional authority. Pending appeals, which could take some time, the Healthcare Reform Act is still operational in all respects. There have been other reform initiatives under the Trump Administration. For example, in May 2018, President Trump and the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services released a “blueprint” to lower prescription drug prices and out-of-pocket costs. Certain proposals in the blueprint, and related drug pricing measures proposed since the blueprint, could cause significant operational and reimbursement changes for the pharmaceutical industry. As another example, in October 2018, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services solicited public comments on potential changes to payment for certain Medicare Part B drugs, including reducing the Medicare payment amount for selected Medicare Part B drugs to more closely align with international drug prices. There have also been efforts by government officials or legislators to implement measures to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products, including legislation on drug importation. Recently, there has been considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing and proposals to address the perceived high cost of pharmaceuticals. There have also been recent state legislative efforts to address drug costs, which generally have focused on increasing transparency around drug costs or limiting drug prices. Certain state legislation has been subject to legal challenges. Adoption of new legislation regulating drug pricing at the federal or state level could further affect demand for, or pricing of, our products. General legislative cost control measures may also affect reimbursement for our products. The Budget Control Act, as amended, resulted in the imposition of 2% reductions in Medicare (but not Medicaid) payments to providers in 2013 and will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Any significant spending reductions affecting Medicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented and/or any significant taxes or fees that may be imposed on us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Third Party Reimbursement and Pricing outside the U.S. We currently have no products approved for marketing outside the U.S., other than a marketing authorization for EXONDYS 51 in Israel. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. In the EU and certain other territories, price controls and Health Technology Assessments for new, highly priced medicines are expected. Uncertainty exists about the pricing and reimbursement status of newly approved products in the EU. Criteria such as cost-effectiveness, cost per quality-adjusted life year, budget impact, or others, in addition to the clinical benefit, are often required to demonstrate added value or benefit of a drug and vary by country. Third party reimbursement limits may reduce the demand for our products. The pace of the application process in some countries could also delay commercial product launches. Gaining acceptance of our product pipeline and an economically viable reimbursement terms in the EU and other markets will require strong education and awareness efforts around DMD as well as strong data supporting its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. -24- Competition The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are intensely competitive, and any product candidate developed by us would likely compete with existing drugs and therapies. There are many pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, public and private universities, government agencies and research organizations that compete with us in developing various approaches to the treatment of rare, neuromuscular and other diseases. Many of these organizations have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing and marketing resources than we have. Several of them have developed or are developing therapies that could be used for treatment of the same diseases that we are targeting. In addition, some of these competitors have significantly greater commercial infrastructures than we have. Our ability to compete successfully will depend largely on: • our ability to complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates; • the efficacy, safety and reliability of our product candidates; • the timing and scope of regulatory approvals; • product acceptance by physicians and other health-care providers; • protection of our proprietary rights and the level of generic competition; • the ability to have freedom to operate to commercialize our product candidates; • the speed at which we develop product candidates; • our ability to supply commercial quantities of a product to the market; • obtaining reimbursement for product use in approved indications; • our ability to recruit and retain skilled employees; and • the availability of substantial capital resources to fund development and commercialization activities, including the availability of funding from the U.S. government. DMD Program Competition . Currently, other than EXONDYS 51, no disease-modifying product has been approved for the treatment of DMD in the U.S. Other companies, however, have product candidates or other interests in development for the treatment of DMD. Wave Life Sciences (“Wave”) announced the selection of its exon 51 skipping product candidate, suvodirsen (WVE-210201). In November 2017, Wave announced the initiation of a global Phase 1 clinical trial for suvodirsen in DMD patients amenable to exon 51 skipping. In December 2018, Wave announced results from a Phase 1 study of suvodirsen. In January 2019, Wave announced its planned phase 2/3 study of suvodirsen was selected for the FDA pilot program for complex innovative trial designs (CID). Wave also announced the selection of its exon 53 skipping product candidate, WVE-N531. Nippon Shinyaku Co. Ltd. (“Nippon”) has reported clinical data for its exon 53 skipping candidate, viltolarsen (NS-065/NCNP-01), from a Phase 1/2 study in Japan and a Phase 2 study in the U.S. Viltolarsen has been reported to have received an orphan drug designation in the U.S., was granted fast track designation by FDA and received a “SAKIGAKE designation” in Japan from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare. Nippon has reported in February 2019 that it has initiated a rolling NDA submission with the FDA with the intent to complete the submission by September 2019. Nippon’s intention to submit its marketing authorization application with the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (“PMDA”) in Japan for viltolarsen by the end of the Japanese fiscal year 2018 has also been reported. Daiichi Sankyo (“Daiichi”) has reported a phase 1/2 clinical trial being underway in Japan for its exon 45 skipping candidate, DS-5141. In April 2018, Daiichi announced top-line results of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial in Japan of DS-5141 and that Daiichi will continue to develop DS-5141. Solid Biosciences, LLC (“Solid”) has reported that its micro-dystrophin gene transfer product candidate for DMD, SGT-001 began a Phase 2 clinical study in December 2017. SGT-001 was granted fast track designation by the FDA in October 2018, orphan drug designation in August 2016, and rare pediatric disease designation in 2017. In Europe, orphan designation was granted in September 2016. In February 2019, Solid reported micro-dystrophin expression data for the first three patients in its clinical trial and announced plans to continue the study at a higher dose pending FDA and IRB approval. Pfizer Inc., following its acquisition of Bamboo Therapeutics, Inc., has initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial in January 2018 to test the safety and tolerability of its AAV-9 / micro-dystrophin gene transfer product candidate for DMD, PF-06939926/BMB-D001. The related orphan designation was granted in Europe in August 2016, and in the U.S. in May 2017. Rare pediatric disease designation was granted by the FDA in April 2018. -25- Other companies continue to pursue approval of products for the treatment of DMD and their products may or may not prove to be safer and/or more efficacious than the products and product candidates in our DMD pipeline. Regarding any of these competitors, it is unknown if further clinical development of these or other exon-skipping compounds is planned. Additionally, companies such as Santhera, PTC Therapeutics, Summit, Catabasis, Pfizer, Fibrogen and Tivorsan have product candidates distinct from ours in different stages of development or approval in DMD which we believe could be seen as complementary to exon skipping and not a direct replacement of our product or product candidates at this time. In addition, several companies and institutions have recently entered into collaborations or other agreements for the development of product candidates, including mRNA, gene (CRISPR, AAV, etc.) or small molecule therapies that are potential competitors for therapies being developed in the muscular dystrophy, neuromuscular, CNS and rare disease space, including but not limited to Biogen Inc., Ionis, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Sanofi, Shire (now Takeda), Eli Lilly, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Moderna Therapeutics, Inc., Summit, Akashi, Catabasis, Capricor Therapeutics, Oxford University, Exonics Therapeutics, and Editas Medicine. Platform Technology Competition . We believe that other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies share a focus on RNA-targeted drug discovery and development. Competitors with respect to our RNA-targeted technologies include, but are not limited to, Alnylam, Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corp., Ionis, BioMarin, Sanofi, Synthena AG, Santaris Pharma A/S (now Roche), Nippon, Daiichi Sankyo, Moderna Therapeutics and Wave. Employees As of December 31, 2018, we had 499 employees, 252 of whom hold advanced degrees. Of these employees, 255 are engaged directly in research and development activities and 244 are in selling, general and administration including 48 in the sales force. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we consider relations with our employees to be good. General Corporate Information We were originally incorporated in the State of Oregon on July 22, 1980, and on June 6, 2013, we reincorporated in the State of Delaware. Our principal executive offices are located at 215 First Street, Suite 415, Cambridge, MA 02142 and our telephone number is (617) 274-4000. On July 12, 2012, our common stock began trading under the symbol “SRPT” on the Nasdaq Global Market on a split-adjusted basis following a one-for-six reverse stock split that was effective on July 11, 2012. Our common stock is quoted on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the same symbol. While we achieve revenue from EXONDYS 51 in the U.S. and through distribution of eteplirsen on a named patient basis or through our EAP outside the U.S., we are likely to continue to incur operating losses in the near term associated with our ongoing operations, research and development activities and potential business development activities. For more information about our revenues and operating losses, see Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $1,174.9 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments, consisting of $370.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, $803.1 million of short-term investments and $1.0 million of long-term restricted investment. We believe that our balance of cash, cash equivalents and investments is sufficient to fund our current operational plan for at least the next twelve months. In addition to pursuing additional cash resources through public or private financings, we may also seek to enter into contracts, including collaborations or licensing agreements with respect to our technologies, with third parties, including government entities.

Set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC are descriptions of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report. Because of the following factors, as well as other variables affecting our operating results, past financial performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Other events that we do not currently anticipate or that we currently deem immaterial also affect our results of operations and financial condition. Risks Related to Our Business We are highly dependent on the commercial success of EXONDYS 51 in the U.S. We may not be able to meet expectations with respect to EXONDYS 51 sales or attain profitability and positive cash-flow from operations. On September 19, 2016, the FDA granted accelerated approval for EXONDYS 51 as a therapeutic treatment for DMD in patients who have a confirmed mutation in the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 51 skipping. EXONDYS 51 is currently commercially available in the U.S. and Israel only, although it is available in certain additional countries outside of the U.S. on a named patient basis and through our EAP. The commercial success of EXONDYS 51 continues to depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to: • the effectiveness of our sales, managed markets, marketing efforts and support for EXONDYS 51; • the consistency of any new data we collect and analyses we conduct with prior results, whether they support a favorable safety, efficacy and effectiveness profile of EXONDYS 51 and any potential impact on our FDA accelerated approval status and/or FDA package insert for EXONDYS 51; • the effectiveness of our ongoing EXONDYS 51 commercialization activities, including negotiating and entering into any additional commercial, supply and distribution contracts, ongoing manufacturing efforts and hiring any additional personnel as needed to support commercial efforts; • our ability to comply with FDA post-marketing requirements and commitments, including through successfully conducting additional studies that confirm clinical efficacy, effectiveness and safety of EXONDYS 51 and acceptance of the same by the FDA and medical community since continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification of a clinical benefit in confirmatory trials; • the occurrence of any side effects, adverse reactions or misuse, or any unfavorable publicity in these areas; • the cost-effectiveness of EXONDYS 51 and whether we can consistently manufacture at acceptable costs; • the rate and consistency with which EXONDYS 51 is prescribed by physicians, which depends on physicians’ views on the safety, effectiveness and efficacy of EXONDYS 51; • our ability to secure and maintain adequate reimbursement for EXONDYS 51, including during re-authorization processes that may be required for patients who initially obtained coverage by third parties, including by government payors, managed care organizations and private health insurers; • our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for EXONDYS 51, to preserve our trade secrets, to prevent third parties from infringing on our proprietary rights and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties; • the development or commercialization of competing products or therapies for the treatment of DMD, or its symptoms, and the existence of competing clinical trials; • our ability to increase awareness of the importance of genetic testing and knowing/understanding DMD mutations, and identifying and addressing procedural barriers to obtaining therapy; • our ability to remain compliant with laws and regulations that apply to us and our commercial activities; -27- • the actual market-size, ability to identify patients and the demographics of patients eligible for EXONDYS 51, which may be different than expected; • the sufficiency of our drug supply to meet commercial and clinical demands and standards, which could be negatively impacted for various reasons, including if our projections on the potential number of amenable patients and their average weight are inaccurate, we are subject to unanticipated regulatory requirements that increase our drug supply needs, our current drug supply is destroyed or negatively impacted at our manufacturing sites, storage sites or in transit, failure to meet cGMP requirements or it takes longer than we project for the number of patients we anticipate to get on EXONDYS 51 and any significant portion of our EXONDYS 51 supply expires before we are able to sell it; • our ability to obtain regulatory approvals to commercialize EXONDYS 51 in markets outside of the U.S. and Israel; and • the process leading to a patient’s first infusion of EXONDYS 51 may be slower for certain patients. For example, the time to first infusion may take longer if a patient chooses to put in an intravenous port, which eases access to the vein. As the launch of EXONDYS 51 continues to progress, we expect the variation among patients to decline, leading to a faster time to infusion. However, delays in the process prior to first infusion could negatively impact the sales of EXONDYS 51. We may experience significant fluctuations in sales of EXONDYS 51 from period to period and, ultimately, we may never generate sufficient revenues from EXONDYS 51 to reach or maintain profitability or sustain our anticipated levels of operations. Even though EXONDYS 51 received accelerated approval by the FDA, it faces future post-approval development and regulatory requirements, which will present additional challenges we will need to successfully navigate. On September 19, 2016, the FDA granted accelerated approval for EXONDYS 51 as a therapeutic treatment for patients with DMD who have a confirmed mutation in the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 51 skipping. This indication is based on an increase in the surrogate biomarker of dystrophin in skeletal muscles observed in some patients treated with EXONDYS 51. EXONDYS 51 will be subject to ongoing FDA requirements governing the labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping of EXONDYS 51, and we are required to submit additional safety, efficacy and other post-marketing information to the FDA. Under the accelerated approval pathway, continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification of a clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. These post-approval requirements and commitments may not be feasible and/or could impose significant burdens and costs on us; could negatively impact our development, manufacturing and supply of EXONDYS 51; and could negatively impact our financial results. Failure to meet post-approval commitments and requirements, including completion of enrollment and in particular, any failure to obtain positive safety and efficacy data from our ongoing and planned EXONDYS 51 studies, would lead to negative regulatory action from the FDA and/or withdrawal of regulatory approval of EXONDYS 51. Manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP regulations. Drug product manufacturers are required to continuously monitor and report adverse events from clinical trials and commercial use of the product. If we or a regulatory agency discover previously unknown adverse events or events of unanticipated severity or frequency, a regulatory agency may require labeling changes implementation of risk evaluation and mitigation strategy program, or additional post-marketing studies or clinical trials. If we or a regulatory agency discover previously unknown problems with a product, such as problems with a facility where the API or drug product is manufactured or tested, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product and/or the manufacturer, including removal of specific product lots from the market, withdrawal of the product from the market, or suspension of manufacturing. Sponsors of drugs approved under FDA accelerated approval provisions also are required to submit to FDA, at least 30 days before initial use, all promotional materials intended for use after the first 120 days following marketing approval. If we or the manufacturing facilities for EXONDYS 51 fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may: • issue warning letters or untitled letters; • seek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines; • suspend or withdraw or alter the conditions of our marketing approval; • mandate modifications to promotional materials or require us to provide corrective information to healthcare practitioners; • suspend any ongoing clinical trials; • require us to enter into a consent decree, which can include imposition of various fines, reimbursements for inspection costs, required due dates for specific actions and penalties for noncompliance; • refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to applications submitted by us; • suspend or impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; -28- • seize or detain products, refuse to permit the import or export of products or require us to initiate a product recall; or • refuse to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. We are subject to uncertainty relating to reimbursement policies which, if not favorable, could hinder or prevent the commercial success of EXONDYS 51 and/or our product candidates. Our ability to successfully maintain and/or increase EXONDYS 51 sales in the U.S. depends in part on the coverage and reimbursement levels set by governmental authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payors. Third party payors are increasingly challenging the effectiveness of and prices charged for medical products and services. We may not be able to obtain or maintain adequate third-party coverage or reimbursement for EXONDYS 51, and/or we may be required to provide discounts or rebates on EXONDYS 51 in order to obtain or maintain adequate coverage. We expect that private insurers will continue to consider the efficacy, effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and safety of EXONDYS 51, including any new data and analyses that we are able to collect and make available in a compliant manner, in determining whether to approve reimbursement for EXONDYS 51 and at what levels. If any new data and information we collect is not favorable, third party insurers may make coverage decisions that negatively impact sales of EXONDYS 51. We continue to have discussions with payors, some of which may eventually deny coverage. We may not receive approval for reimbursement of EXONDYS 51 from additional insurers on a satisfactory rate or basis, in which case our business would be materially adversely affected. In addition, obtaining these approvals can be a time consuming and expensive process. Our business would be materially adversely affected if we are not able to maintain favorable coverage decisions and/or fail to receive additional favorable coverage decisions from third party insurers, in particular during re-authorization processes for patients that have already initiated therapy. Our business could also be adversely affected if government health programs, private health insurers, including managed care organizations, or other reimbursing bodies or payors limit the indications for which EXONDYS 51 will be reimbursed or fail to recognize accelerated approval and surrogate endpoints as clinically meaningful. In some foreign countries, particularly Canada and the countries of Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to strict governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take 12 to 24 months or longer after the receipt of regulatory approval and product launch. In order to obtain favorable reimbursement for the indications sought or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to collect additional data, including conducting additional studies. Furthermore, several European countries have implemented government measures to either freeze or reduce pricing of pharmaceutical products. If reimbursement for our products is unavailable in any country in which reimbursement is sought, limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be materially harmed. In addition, many foreign countries are referencing to other countries’ official public price, hence an unsatisfactory price level in one country could consequently impinge negatively upon overall revenue. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of EXONDYS 51 and our future products due to a number of factors, including current and future healthcare reforms and initiatives by government health programs and private insurers (including managed care plans) to reduce healthcare costs, the scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing, the ongoing debates on reducing government spending and additional legislative proposals. These healthcare reform efforts or any future legislation or regulatory actions aimed at controlling and reducing healthcare costs, including through measures designed to limit reimbursement, restrict access or impose unfavorable pricing modifications on pharmaceutical products, could impact our and our partners’ ability to obtain or maintain reimbursement for our products at satisfactory levels, or at all, which could materially harm our business and financial results. Additionally, our gene therapy product candidates represent novel approaches to treatment that will call for new levels of innovation in both pricing and drug access strategies. Current reimbursement models may not accommodate the unique factors of our gene therapy product candidates, including potentially curative efficacy, high up-front costs, lack of long-term efficacy and safety data and fees associated with complex administration, dosing and patient monitoring requirements. Hence, it may be necessary to restructure approaches to payment, pricing strategies and traditional payment models to support these therapies. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. If we are unable to obtain adequate levels of reimbursement, our ability to successfully market and sell our product candidates will be harmed. The manner and level at which reimbursement is provided for services related to our product candidates (e.g., for administration of our product to patients) is also important. Inadequate reimbursement for such services may lead to physician resistance and limit our ability to market or sell our products. -29- Healthcare reform and other governmental and private payor initiatives may have an adverse effect upon, and could prevent commercial success of EXONDYS 51 and our other product candidates. The U.S. government and individual states have aggressively pursued healthcare reform, as evidenced by the passing of the Healthcare Reform Act and the ongoing efforts to modify or repeal that legislation. The Healthcare Reform Act substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and contains a number of provisions that affect coverage and reimbursement of drug products and/or that could potentially reduce the demand for pharmaceutical products such as increasing drug rebates under state Medicaid programs for brand name prescription drugs and extending those rebates to Medicaid managed care and assessing a fee on manufacturers and importers of brand name prescription drugs reimbursed under certain government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. Other aspects of healthcare reform, such as expanded government enforcement authority and heightened standards that could increase compliance-related costs, could also affect our business. Modifications have been implemented under the Trump Administration and additional modifications or repeal may occur. There are, and may continue to be, judicial challenges. See “GOVERNMENT REGULATION- Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement- Third Party Reimbursement and Pricing in the U.S.-Healthcare and Other Reform.” We cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any changes to the Healthcare Reform Act or other federal and state reform efforts. There is no assurance that federal or state health care reform will not adversely affect our future business and financial results, and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative, judicial or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, waiver from Medicaid drug rebate law requirements, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. We anticipate that the U.S. Congress, state legislatures and the private sector will continue to consider and may adopt healthcare policies intended to curb rising healthcare costs. These cost containment measures may include implementation or modification of: • controls on government funded reimbursement for drugs; • caps or mandatory discounts under certain government sponsored programs; • controls on healthcare providers; • challenges to the pricing of drugs or limits or prohibitions on reimbursement for specific products through other means; • reform of drug importation laws; • delegation of decision making to state Medicaid agencies and waiver of reimbursement requirements; • expansion of use of managed care systems in which healthcare providers contract to provide comprehensive healthcare for a fixed cost per person; and • prohibition on direct-to-consumer advertising or drug marketing practices. We are unable to predict what additional legislation, regulations or policies, if any, relating to the healthcare industry or third party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future or what effect such legislation, regulations or policies would have on our business. Any cost containment measures, including those listed above, or other healthcare system reforms that are adopted, could significantly decrease the available coverage and the price we might establish for EXONDYS 51 and our other potential products, which would have an adverse effect on our net revenues and operating results. EXONDYS 51 may not be widely adopted by patients, payors or healthcare providers, which would adversely impact our potential profitability and future business prospects. EXONDYS 51’s commercial success, particularly in the near term in the U.S., depends upon its level of market adoption by patients, payors and healthcare providers. If EXONDYS 51 does not achieve an adequate level of market adoption for any reason, or if market adoption does not persist, our potential profitability and our future business prospects will be severely adversely impacted. The degree of market acceptance of EXONDYS 51 depends on a number of factors, including: • our ability to demonstrate to the medical community, including specialists who may purchase or prescribe EXONDYS 51, the clinical efficacy, effectiveness and safety of EXONDYS 51 as the prescription product of choice for DMD amenable to exon-51 skipping in the U.S.; • the effectiveness of our sales and marketing organizations and distribution networks; • the ability of patients or providers to be adequately reimbursed for EXONDYS 51 in a timely manner from government and private payors; -30- • the actual and perceived efficacy and safety profile of EXONDYS 51, particularly if unanticipated adverse events related to EXONDYS 51 treatment arise and create safety concerns among potential patients or prescribers or if new data and analyses we obtain for eteplirsen do not support, or are interpreted by some parties to not support, the efficacy of EXONDYS 51; and • the efficacy and safety of our other exon-skipping product candidates, including our exon 45 and exon 53 product candidates ( casimersen and golodirsen, respectively), and third parties’ competitive therapies. We may not be able to expand the global footprint of EXONDYS 51 outside of the U.S. Even though EXONDYS 51 was approved for marketing in the U.S. and in Israel, we may not receive approval to commercialize EXONDYS 51 in additional countries. In November 2016, we submitted a MAA for eteplirsen to the EMA and the application was validated in December 2016. As we announced on June 1, 2018, the CHMP of the EMA adopted a negative opinion for eteplirsen. In September 2018, the CHMP of the EMA confirmed its negative opinion for eteplirsen, and the European Commission adopted the CHMP opinion in December 2018. We plan to seek follow up EMA scientific advice in 2019 to explore a potential approach for EMA approval of eteplirsen. In order to market any product in a foreign country, we must comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements for approval in those countries regarding demonstration of evidence of the product’s safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, labeling, distribution, advertising, and promotion, as well as pricing and reimbursement of the product. Obtaining marketing approval in a foreign country is an extensive, lengthy, expensive and uncertain process, and the regulatory authority may reject an application or delay, limit or deny approval of eteplirsen for many reasons, including: • we may not be able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of foreign regulatory authorities that eteplirsen is safe and effective for the treatment of patients with DMD who have a confirmed mutation in the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 51 skipping; • the results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical or clinical significance required for approval by foreign regulatory authorities; • foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the adequacy (number, design, size, controls, conduct or implementation) of our clinical trials prior to granting approval, and we may not be able to generate the required data on a timely basis, or at all; • regulatory authorities may conclude that data we submit to them fail to demonstrate an appropriate level of safety or efficacy of eteplirsen or that eteplirsen’s clinical benefits outweigh its safety risks; • regulatory authorities outside the U.S. may not accept data generated at our clinical trial sites or require us to generate additional data or information; • regulatory authorities outside the U.S. may impose limitations or restrictions on the approved labeling of eteplirsen, thus limiting intended users or providing an additional hurdle for market acceptance of the product; • regulatory authorities outside the U.S. may identify deficiencies in the manufacturing processes, or may require us to change our manufacturing process or specifications; and • regulatory authorities outside the U.S. may adopt new or revised approval policies and regulations. Approval procedures vary among countries, and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ significantly from that required to obtain approval in the U.S. In particular, in many foreign countries, it is required that a product receives pricing and reimbursement approval before the product can be distributed commercially. Many foreign countries undertake cost-containment measures that could affect pricing or reimbursement of eteplirsen. This can result in substantial delays, and the price that is ultimately approved in some countries may be lower than the price for which we expect to offer EXONDYS 51. Marketing approval in one country does not ensure marketing approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining marketing approval in one country may have a negative effect on the approval process in others. Failure to obtain marketing approval in other countries or any delay or setback in obtaining such approval would impair our ability to develop foreign markets for eteplirsen and could adversely affect our business and financial condition. In addition, failure to obtain approval in one country or area may affect sales under the EAP in other countries or areas. Even if we are successful in obtaining regulatory approval of eteplirsen in additional countries , our revenue earning capacity will depend on commercial and medical infrastructure, pricing and reimbursement negotiations and decisions with third party payors, including government payors. -31- We cannot predict whether historical revenues from eteplirsen on a named patient basis or through our E AP outside the U.S. will continue or whether we will be able to continue to distribute eteplirsen on a named patient basis or through our EAP . In certain countries outside the U.S., reimbursement for products that have not yet received marketing authorization may be provided through national managed access programs. We have contracted with third party distributors to distribute eteplirsen in certain countries outside the U.S. on a named patient basis and launched an ex-U.S. eteplirsen EAP, which we plan to expand to other jurisdictions in the future. While we generate revenue from the distribution of eteplirsen through named patient programs and our EAP, we cannot predict whether historical revenues from these programs will continue, whether we will be able to continue to distribute our products on a named patient basis or through EAP in these countries, whether we will be able to commercialize our products in countries where the products have historically been available on a named patient basis, or whether commercial revenues will exceed revenues historically generated from sales on a named patient basis or through our EAP. Reimbursement through national early access programs may cease to be available if authorization for a named patient program and/or EAP expires or is terminated. For example, healthcare providers in EAP jurisdictions may not be convinced that their patients can benefit from eteplirsen or may prefer to wait until such time as eteplirsen is approved by a regulatory authority in their country before prescribing eteplirsen. Even if a healthcare provider is interested in obtaining access to eteplirsen for its patient through the EAP, the patient will not be able to obtain access to eteplirsen if payment for the drug is not secured. Any failure to maintain revenues from sales of eteplirsen on a named patient basis or through our EAP and/or to generate revenues from commercial sales of eteplirsen exceeding historical sales on a named patient basis or through our EAP could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. If we are unable to successfully maintain and further develop internal commercialization capabilities, sales of EXONDYS 51 may be negatively impacted. We have hired and trained a commercial team and put in the organizational infrastructure we believe we need to support the commercial success of EXONDYS 51 in the U.S. Factors that may inhibit our efforts to maintain and further develop commercial capabilities include: • an inability to retain an adequate number of effective commercial personnel; • an inability to train sales personnel, who may have limited experience with our company or EXONDYS 51, to deliver a consistent message regarding EXONDYS 51 and be effective in convincing physicians to prescribe EXONDYS 51; • an inability to equip sales personnel with compliant and effective materials, including medical and sales literature to help them educate physicians and our healthcare providers regarding EXONDYS 51 and its proper administration and educate payors on the safety, efficacy and effectiveness profile of EXONDYS 51 to support favorable coverage decisions; and • unforeseen costs and expenses associated with maintaining and further developing an independent sales and marketing organization. If we are not successful in maintaining an effective commercial, sales and marketing infrastructure, we will encounter difficulty in achieving, maintaining or increasing projected sales of EXONDYS 51 in the U.S., which would adversely affect our business and financial condition. If we are unable to execute effectively our sales and marketing activities outside the U.S., we may be unable to generate sufficient product revenue. EXONDYS 51 is our first commercial product. As a result, our sales, marketing, managerial and other non-technical capabilities are relatively new in the U.S. We have built a commercial sales force in Europe and we are currently in the process of building commercial infrastructure in other key countries in order to be ready to launch eteplirsen with a relatively small specialty sales force in the event eteplirsen is ultimately approved in those jurisdictions. The establishment and development of our commercial infrastructure will continue to be expensive and time consuming, and we may not be able to successfully develop this capability in a timely manner or at all. We anticipate building sales, medical, marketing, managerial, distribution and other capabilities across multiple jurisdictions to prepare for potential approvals ex-U.S. Doing so will require a high degree of coordination and compliance with laws and regulations in such jurisdictions. If we are unable to effectively coordinate such activities or comply with such laws and regulations, our ability to commercialize eteplirsen in such jurisdictions will be adversely affected. Even if we are able to effectively hire a sales force and develop a marketing and sales capabilities, our sales force may not be successful in commercializing eteplirsen or any other product candidate that we develop. If we are unable to establish adequate manufacturing, sales, marketing, supply and distribution capabilities, whether independently or with third parties, we may not be able to generate product revenue and may not become profitable outside of the U.S. -32- If we fail to obtain or maintain regulatory exclusivity for our products, then we may not be able to protect our products from competition and our business may be adversely impacted. If a competitor obtains an authorization to market the same or substantially same product before a product of ours is authorized in a given country and is granted regulatory exclusivity, then our product may not be authorized for sale as a result of the competitor’s regulatory exclusivity and as a result, our investment in the development of that product may not be returned. In addition to any patent protection, we rely on various forms of regulatory exclusivity to protect our products. During the development of our products, we anticipate regulatory exclusivities available upon approval of our products. Implementation and enforcement of regulatory exclusivity, which may consist of regulatory data protection and market protection, varies widely from country to country. Failure to qualify for regulatory exclusivity, or failure to obtain or maintain the extent or duration of such protections that we expect in each of the markets for our products due to challenges, changes or interpretations in the law or otherwise, could affect our revenues for our products or our decision on whether to market our products in a particular country or countries or could otherwise have an adverse impact on our results of operations. We are not guaranteed to receive or maintain regulatory exclusivity for our current or future products, and if our products that are granted orphan status were to lose their status as orphan drugs or the data or marketing exclusivity provided for orphan drugs, our business and operations could be adversely affected. Due to the nature of EXONDYS 51 and product candidate pipeline, in addition to new biologic exclusivity, orphan drug exclusivity is especially important for our products that are eligible for orphan drug designation. For eligible products, we plan to rely on orphan drug exclusivity to maintain a competitive position. If we do not have adequate patent protection for our products, then the relative importance of obtaining regulatory exclusivity is even greater. While orphan status for any of our products, if granted or maintained, would provide market exclusivity for the time periods specified above upon approval, we would not be able to exclude other companies from obtaining regulatory approval of products using the same or similar active ingredient for the same indication beyond the exclusivity period applicable to our product on the basis of orphan drug status (e.g., seven years in the U.S.). Orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug, nor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process. In addition, we may face risks with maintaining regulatory exclusivities for our product, and our protection may be circumvented, even if maintained. For instance, orphan drug exclusivity in the U.S. may be rescinded if (i) an alternative, competing product demonstrates clinical superiority to our product with orphan exclusivity; (ii) we are unable to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of our orphan product to meet the needs of patients. Moreover, competitors may receive approval of different drugs or biologics for indications for which our prior approved orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity in Europe may be modified for several reasons, including a significant change to the orphan medicinal product designations or status criteria after-market authorization of the orphan product ( e.g. , product profitability exceeds the criteria for orphan drug designation), problems with the production or supply of the orphan drug, or a competitor drug, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior than the initial orphan drug. Thus, we cannot guarantee that another company will not receive approval to market a product candidate that is granted orphan drug exclusivity for the same drug or similar drug and same orphan indication as any of our product candidates for which we plan to file an NDA, Biologics License Application (“BLA”) or MAA. If that were to happen, any pending NDA, BLA or MAA for our product candidate for that indication may not be approved until the competing company’s period of exclusivity has expired in the U.S. or the EU, as applicable. Even though we have obtained orphan drug designation for certain of our product candidates and even if we obtain orphan drug designation for these or our future product candidates, due to the uncertainties associated with developing biopharmaceutical products, we may not be the first to obtain marketing approval for any particular orphan indication, which means that we may not obtain orphan drug exclusivity and could also potentially be blocked from approval of certain product candidates until the competitor’s orphan drug exclusivity period on its product expires (e.g., seven years in the U.S.). Moreover, with respect to antisense oligonucleotides and gene therapy, it is uncertain how similarity between product candidates designed to treat the same rare disease or condition may be determined on a country-by-country basis and whether the orphan drug exclusivity of a previously approved product can block the approval of a chemically distinct product candidate under regulatory review. The patient population suffering from DMD, LGMDs, Pompe disease and MPS IIIA is small and has not been established with precision. If the actual number of patients is smaller than we estimate, our revenue and ability to achieve profitability may be adversely affected. DMD, LGMD, Pompe disease, CMT and MPS IIIA are rare, fatal genetic neuromuscular disorders. DMD affects an estimated one in approximately every 3,500 to 5,000 males born worldwide, of which up to 13% are estimated to be amenable to exon-51 skipping. LGMDs as a class affect an estimated range of approximately one in every 14,500 to one in every 123,000 individuals. Pompe disease affects an estimated one in approximately every 40,000 individuals. CMT is a group of peripheral nerve disorders affecting approximately one in every 2,500 individuals. CMT type 1A affects approximately 50,000 patients in the U.S. MPS IIIA affects approximately 1 in 100,000 newborns. Our estimates of the size of these patient populations are based on published studies as well as internal analyses. Various factors may decrease the market size of our product and product candidates, including the -33- severity of the disease, patient demographics and the response of patients’ immune systems to our product candidates. If the results of these studies or our analysis of them do not accurately reflect the relevant patient population, our assessment of the market may be inaccurate, making it difficult or impossible for us to meet our revenue goals, or to obtain and maintain profitability. We face intense competition and rapid technological change, which may result in other companies discovering, developing or commercializing competitive products. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and subject to significant and rapid technological change. We are aware of many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are actively engaged in research and development in areas in which our product and product candidates are aimed. Some of these competitors are developing or testing product candidates that now, or may in the future, compete directly with our product or our product candidates. For example, we face competition in the field of DMD by third parties who are developing or who had once developed: (i) exon skipping product candidates, such as Wave Life Sciences (notably for exons 51 and 53), Nippon Shinyaku (notably for exon 53), Daiichi Sankyo (notably for exon 45); (ii) gene therapies that express microdystrophin or mini-dystrophin, such as Pfizer and Solid Biosciences; (iii) CRISPR/Cas 9 approaches, such as Exonics Therapeutics and Editas Medicine; (iv) other disease modifying approaches, such as PTC Therapeutics, which has a small molecule candidate, ataluren, that targets nonsense mutations; and (v) other approaches that may be palliative in nature or potentially complementary with our product and product candidates and that are being developed by Santhera, Summit, Catabasis, Pfizer, Fibrogen and Tivorsan. Although BioMarin announced on May 31, 2016 its intent to discontinue clinical and regulatory development of drisapersen as well as its other clinical stage candidates, BMN 044, BMN 045 and BMN 053, then-currently in Phase 2 studies for distinct forms of DMD, it further announced its intent to continue to explore the development of next generation oligonucleotides for the treatment of DMD. In addition, we are aware of many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are actively engaged in research and development using platform technologies that may be viewed as competing with ours beyond and including those companies mentioned immediately above, such as Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Roche Innovation Center Copenhagen (formerly Santaris Pharma A/S), Shire plc (now Takeda), Biogen, Sanofi Additionally, several companies and institutions have entered into collaborations or other agreements for the development of product candidates, including mRNA, gene therapy and gene editing (CRIPSR and AAV, among others) and small molecule therapies that are potential competitors for therapies being developed in the muscular dystrophy, neuromuscular and rare disease space, including, but not limited to, Biogen Inc., Ionis, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Sanofi, Shire (now Takeda), Eli Lilly, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Moderna Therapeutics, Inc., Summit, Akashi, Catabasis, Capricor Therapeutics, Oxford University, Exonics Therapeutics, and Editas Medicine. If any of our competitors are successful in obtaining regulatory approval for any of their product candidates, it may limit our ability to enter into the market, gain market share or maintain market share in the DMD space or other diseases targeted by our platform technologies, product and product candidate pipeline. It is possible that our competitors will succeed in developing technologies that limit the market size for our product or product candidates, impact the regulatory approval and post-marketing process for our product and product candidates, are more effective than our product candidates or would render our technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. Our competitors may, among other things: • develop safer or more effective products; • implement more effective approaches to sales and marketing; • develop less costly products; • obtain regulatory approval more quickly; • have access to more manufacturing capacity; • develop products that are more convenient and easier to administer; • form more advantageous strategic alliances; or • establish superior intellectual property positions. We may engage in future acquisitions or collaborations with other entities that complement or expand our business. We may not be able to complete such transactions, and such transactions, if executed, may increase our capital requirements, dilute our stockholders, cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities and subject us to other risks. In order to achieve our long-term business objectives, we actively evaluate various strategic transactions on an ongoing basis, including licensing or acquiring complementary products, technologies or businesses. We may face competition from other companies -34- in pursuing acquisitions and similar transactions in the biotechnology industry. This competition is most intense for approved drugs and late-stage drug candidates, which have the lowest risk and would have the most immediate effect on our financial performance. Our ability to complete transactions may also be limited by applicable antitrust and trade regulation laws and regulations in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions in which we or the operations or assets we seek to acquire carry on business. To the extent that we are successful in undertaking acquisitions or collaborations with other entities, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of such transaction, each of which involves numerous risks, including: • failure to successfully develop the acquired or licensed drugs or technology or to achieve strategic objectives, including successfully developing and commercializing the drugs, drug candidates or technologies that we acquire or license; • entry into markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience or where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions; • disruption of our ongoing business, distraction of our management and employees from other opportunities and challenges and retention of key employees; • potential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired company, or acquired or licensed product or technology, including but not limited to, problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges with respect to intellectual property, product quality, safety, accounting practices, employee, customer or third party relations and other known and unknown liabilities; • liability for activities of the acquired company or licensor before the acquisition or license, including intellectual property infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities; • exposure to litigation or other claims in connection with, or inheritance of claims or litigation risk as a result of an acquisition or license, including but not limited to, claims from terminated employees, customers, former equity holders or other third-parties; • difficulty in integrating the drugs, drug candidates, technologies, business operations and personnel of an acquired asset or company; and • difficulties in the integration of the acquired company’s departments, systems, including accounting, human resource and other administrative systems, technologies, books and records, and procedures, as well as in maintaining uniform standards, controls, including internal control over financial reporting required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related procedures and policies. In addition, even if we achieve the long-term benefits associated with strategic transactions, our expenses and short-term costs may increase materially and adversely affect our liquidity and short-term net income (loss). Future licenses or acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, the creation of contingent liabilities, impairment expenses related to goodwill, and impairment or amortization expenses related to other intangible assets, which could harm our financial condition. Risks Related to the Development of our Product Candidates We may find it difficult to enroll patients in our clinical trials, which could delay or prevent clinical trials of our product candidates. Identifying and qualifying patients to participate in clinical trials of our product candidates is critical to our success. The timing of our clinical trials depends on the speed at which we can recruit eligible patients to participate in testing our product candidates. We have experienced delays in some of our clinical trials, and we may experience similar delays in the future. These delays could result in increased costs, delays in advancing our product development, delays in testing the effectiveness of our technology or termination of the clinical trials altogether. We may not be able to identify, recruit and enroll a sufficient number of patients, or those with required or desired characteristics to achieve diversity in a study, to complete our clinical trials in a timely manner. Patient enrollment is affected by factors including: • design of the study protocol; • size of the patient population; • eligibility criteria for the study in question; • manufacturing of product candidates; -35- • perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study, including as a result of adverse effects observed in similar or competing therapies; • proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients; • availability of competing therapies and clinical trials; • efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials; • patient referral practices of physicians; • activities of patient advocacy groups; • ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment; and • severity of the disease under investigation. In particular, each of the conditions for which we plan to evaluate our product candidates are rare genetic diseases with limited patient pools from which to draw for clinical trials. Further, because newborn screening for these diseases is not widely adopted, and it can be difficult to diagnose these diseases in the absence of a genetic screen, we may have difficulty finding patients who are eligible to participate in our studies. The eligibility criteria of our clinical trials will further limit the pool of available study participants. Additionally, the process of finding and diagnosing patients may prove costly. The treating physicians in our clinical trials may also use their medical discretion in advising patients enrolled in our clinical trials to withdraw from our studies to try alternative therapies. We may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials if we cannot enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in the clinical trials required by the FDA or the EMA or other regulatory agencies. Our ability to successfully initiate, enroll and complete a clinical trial in any foreign country is subject to numerous risks unique to conducting business in foreign countries, including: • difficulty in establishing or managing relationships with contract research organizations (“CROs”) and physicians; • different standards for the conduct of clinical trials; • our inability to locate qualified local consultants, physicians and partners; and • the potential burden of complying with a variety of foreign laws, medical standards and regulatory requirements, including the regulation of pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and treatment. If we have difficulty enrolling a sufficient number of patients to conduct our clinical trials as planned, we may need to delay, limit or terminate ongoing or planned clinical trials, any of which would have an adverse effect on our business. Failures or delays in the commencement or completion of our ongoing and planned clinical trials of our product candidates could cause us not to meet our expected timelines or result in increased costs to us, and could delay, prevent or limit our ability to gain regulatory approval of any product candidate and to generate revenue and continue our business. Successful completion of clinical trials at each applicable stage of development is a prerequisite to submitting a marketing application to the regulatory agencies and, consequently, the ultimate approval and commercial marketing of any of our product candidates for the indications in which we develop them. We do not know whether any of our clinical trials will begin or be completed, and results announced, as planned or expected, if at all, as the commencement and completion of clinical trials and announcement of results can be delayed or prevented for a number of reasons, including, among others: • denial by the regulatory agencies of permission to proceed with our planned clinical trials or any other clinical trials we may initiate, or placement of a clinical trial on hold; • delays in filing or receiving approvals of additional INDs that may be required; • negative results from our ongoing non-clinical trials or clinical trials; • challenges in identifying, recruiting, enrolling and retaining patients to participate in clinical trials • timely and effectively contract with (under reasonable terms), manage and work with investigators, institutions, hospitals and the CROs involved in the clinical trial; • negotiate contracts and other related documents with clinical trial parties and institutional review boards, such as informed consents, CRO agreements and site agreements, which can be subject to extensive negotiations that could cause -36- significant delays in the clinical trial process, with terms possibly varying significantly among different trial sites and CROs and possibly subjecting the Company to various risks; • inadequate quantity or quality of supplies of a product candidate or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials, for example as a result of delays in defining and implementing the manufacturing process for materials used in pivotal trials or for the manufacture of larger quantities or other delays or issues arising in the manufacturing of sufficient supply of finished drug product; • difficulties obtaining IRB approval, and equivalent approval for sites outside the U.S., to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site or sites; • ensure adherence to trial designs and protocols agreed upon and approved by regulatory authorities and applicable legal and regulatory guidelines; • delays or problems in analyzing data, or the need for additional analysis or data or the need to enroll additional patients; • the occurrence of serious adverse events or unexpected drug-related side effects experienced by patients in a clinical trial or unexpected results in ongoing non-clinical trials; • delays in validating endpoints utilized in a clinical trial; • our inability to satisfy the requirements of the regulatory agencies to commence clinical trials, including CMC requirements, or other regulatory requirements prior to the initiation of a clinical trial; • the regulatory agencies disagreeing with our clinical trial design and our interpretation of data from clinical trials, or changing the requirements for approval even after the regulatory authority has reviewed and commented on the design for our clinical trials; • reports from non-clinical or clinical testing of competing therapies that raise safety or efficacy concerns; and • the recruitment and retention of employees, consultants or contractors with the required level of expertise. Any inability to successfully complete preclinical and clinical development could result in additional costs to us or impair our ability to generate revenues from product sales, regulatory and commercialization milestones and royalties. In addition, if we make manufacturing or formulation changes to our product candidates, we may need to conduct additional studies to demonstrate comparability of our modified product candidates to earlier versions. Clinical study delays could also shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, which could impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business and results of operations. Results from pre-clinical and early‑stage clinical trials may not be indicative of efficacy in late‑stage clinical trials, and our pre-clinical and clinical trials may fail to demonstrate acceptable levels of safety, efficacy, and quality of our product candidates, which could prevent or significantly delay their regulatory approval. To obtain the requisite regulatory approvals to market and sell any of our product candidates, we must demonstrate, through extensive pre-clinical and clinical trials, that the product candidate is safe and effective in humans. Ongoing and future pre-clinical and clinical trials of our product candidates may not show sufficient safety, efficacy or adequate quality to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals. For example, although we believe the pre-clinical data for PPMO SRP-5051 collected to date is positive, the additional data we collect, including in the clinic, may not be consistent with the pre-clinical data or show a safe benefit that warrants further development or pursuit of a regulatory approval for PPMO product candidates. Furthermore, success in pre-clinical and early clinical trials does not ensure that the subsequent trials will be successful, nor does it predict final results of a confirmatory trial. Some of our clinical trials were conducted with small patient populations and were not blinded or placebo-controlled, making it difficult to predict whether the favorable results that we observed in such trials will be repeated in larger and more advanced clinical trials. For example, on October 3, 2018, Nationwide presented positive results from a Phase 1/2a micro-dystrophin gene therapy clinical trial in four individuals with DMD enrolled in the trial. In addition, on February 27, 2019, we announced positive expression and biomarker data from the first three-patient cohort dosed in the MYO-101 gene therapy trial to treat LGMD type 2E, or beta-sarcoglycanopathy . The early data is based on small patient samples and therefore may not be predictive of future results. In addition, we cannot assure that the results of additional data or data from any future trial will yield results that are consistent with the early data presented, that we will be able to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of AAVrh.74, that later trial results will support further development, or even if such later results are favorable, that we will be able to successfully complete the development of, obtain accelerated, conditional or standard regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize AAVrh74.MHCK7.micro-Dystrophin. Similarly, we cannot provide assurances that data from our studies with respect to EXONDYS 51, golodirsen, casimersen and other gene therapy-based product candidates will be positive and consistent through the study periods -37- or that the interpretation by regulators, such as the FDA or EMA, of the data we collect for our product or product candidates will be consistent with our interpretations. Our product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of product candidates, limit the commercial potential or result in significant negative consequences following any potential marketing approval. Our product candidates may cause undesirable side effects. In addition to side effects caused by product candidates, the administration process or related procedures also can cause adverse side effects. If any such adverse events occur in our trials, we may decide, or the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authorities could order us, to halt, delay or amend preclinical development or clinical development of our product candidates or we may be unable to receive regulatory approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. Even if we are able to demonstrate that all future serious adverse events are not product-related, such occurrences could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial. Moreover, if we elect, or are required, to delay, suspend or terminate any clinical trial of any of our product candidates, the commercial prospects of such product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate product revenues from any of these product candidates may be delayed or eliminated. Any of these occurrences may harm our ability to develop other product candidates and may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly. Our gene therapy product candidates may be perceived as unsafe or may result in unforeseen adverse events. Negative public opinion and increased regulatory scrutiny of gene therapy may damage public perception of the safety of our gene therapy product candidates and harm our ability to conduct our business or obtain regulatory approvals for our gene therapy product candidates. Gene therapy remains a newly applied technology, with only a few gene therapy products approved to date in the U.S., the EU or elsewhere. Public perception may be influenced by claims that gene therapy is unsafe, and gene therapy may not gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community. In particular, our success will depend upon physicians who specialize in the treatment of genetic diseases targeted by our product candidates, prescribing treatments that involve the use of our product candidates in lieu of, or in addition to, existing treatments with which they are familiar and for which greater clinical data may be available. In addition, ethical, social and legal concerns about gene therapy, genetic testing and genetic research could result in additional regulations or prohibiting the processes we may use. Federal and state agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments have expressed their intentions to further regulate biotechnology. More restrictive regulations or claims that our product candidates are unsafe or pose a hazard could prevent us from commercializing any products. New government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, regulations, policies or guidance changed, or interpretations by agencies or courts changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. More restrictive government regulations or negative public opinion would harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and may delay or impair the development and commercialization of our gene therapy product candidates or demand for any products we may develop. For example, earlier gene therapy trials led to several well-publicized adverse events, including death. Serious adverse events related to clinical trials we, our strategic partners or other companies conduct, even if such adverse events are not ultimately attributable to the relevant product candidates or products, may result in increased government regulation, unfavorable public perception, potential regulatory delays in the testing or approval of our product candidates, stricter labeling requirements for those product candidates that are approved and a decrease in demand for any such product candidates. If there are significant delays in obtaining or we are unable to obtain or maintain required regulatory approvals, we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates in a timely manner or at all, which could impair our ability to generate sufficient revenue and have a successful business. The research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, commercialization, marketing, selling and distribution of drug products are subject to extensive regulation by applicable local, regional and national regulatory authorities and regulations may differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In the U.S., approvals and oversight from federal (e.g., FDA), state and other regulatory authorities are required for these activities. Sale and marketing of our product candidates in the U.S. or other countries is not permitted until we obtain the required approvals from the applicable regulatory authorities. Of the large number of drugs in development in the biopharmaceutical industry, only a small percentage result in the submission of a marketing application to the FDA or an MAA to the EMA and even fewer are approved for commercialization. -38- Our ability to obtain the government or regulatory approvals required to commercialize any of our product candidates in any jurisdiction, including in the U.S. or the EU, cannot be assured, may be significantly delayed or may never be achieved for various reasons including the following: • Our non-clinical, clinical, chemistry, manufacturing and controls and other data and analyses from past, current and future studies for any of our product candidates may not be sufficient to meet regulatory requirements for marketing application approvals. The regulatory authorities could disagree with our interpretations and conclusions regarding data we provide in connection with NDA, BLA or MAA submissions for one or more of our product candidates, and may delay, reject or refuse to accept for review, or approve any submission we make or identify additional requirements for product approval to be submitted upon completion, if ever. In addition, in the U.S., an FDA advisory committee could determine that our data are insufficient to provide a positive recommendation for approval of any NDA or BLA we submit to the FDA. Even if we meet FDA requirements and an advisory committee votes to recommend approval of an NDA or BLA submission, the FDA could still disagree with the advisory committee’s recommendation and deny approval of a product candidate based on their review. • The regulatory approval process for product candidates targeting orphan diseases, such as DMD, that use new technologies and processes, such as antisense oligonucleotide therapies, gene therapy and other alternative approaches or endpoints for the determination of efficacy is uncertain due to, among other factors, evolving interpretations of a new therapeutic class, the broad discretion of regulatory authorities, lack of precedent, small safety databases, varying levels of applicable expertise of regulators or their advisory committees, scientific developments, changes in the competitor landscape, shifting political priorities and changes in applicable laws, rules or regulations and interpretations of the same. As a result of uncertainty in the approval process for products intended to treat serious rare diseases, we may not be able to anticipate, prepare for or satisfy requests or requirements from regulatory authorities, including completing and submitting planned NDAs, BLAs and MAAs for our product candidates, in a timely manner, or at all. Examples of such requests or requirements could include, but are not limited to, conducting additional or redesigned trials and procedures (e.g., additional safety data, patient muscle biopsies, dystrophin analyses and using different assays), repeating or completing additional analysis of our data, or providing additional supportive data. In addition, in the U.S., an FDA advisory committee or regulators may disagree with our data analysis, interpretations and conclusions at any point in the approval process, which could negatively impact the approval of our NDA or BLA or result in a decision by the Company not to proceed with an NDA or BLA submission for a product candidate based on feedback from regulators. • We may not have the resources required to meet regulatory requirements and successfully navigate what is generally a lengthy, expensive and extensive approval process for commercialization of drug product candidates. Any failure on our part to respond to these requirements in a timely and satisfactory manner could significantly delay or negatively impact confirmatory study timelines and/or the development plans we have for golodirsen, casimersen, PPMO, gene therapy-based product candidates or other product candidates. Responding to requests from regulators and meeting requirements for clinical trials, submissions and approvals may require substantial personnel, financial or other resources, which, as a small biopharmaceutical company, we may not be able to obtain in a timely manner or at all. In addition, our ability to respond to requests from regulatory authorities that involve our agents, third party vendors and associates may be complicated by our own limitations and those of the parties we work with. It may be difficult or impossible for us to conform to regulatory guidance or successfully execute our product development plans in response to regulatory guidance, including guidance related to clinical trial design with respect to any NDA, BLA or MAA submissions. Even if our product candidates demonstrate safety and efficacy in clinical studies, the regulatory agencies may not complete their review processes in a timely manner, or we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval. Additional delays may result if an FDA Advisory Committee or other regulatory advisory group or authority recommends non-approval or restrictions on approval. In addition, we may experience delays or rejections based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action, or changes in regulatory agency policy during the period of product development, clinical studies and the review process. Regulatory agencies also may approve a treatment candidate for fewer or more limited indications than requested or may grant approval subject to the performance of post-marketing studies. Finally, regulatory agencies may not approve the labeling claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our treatment candidates. Even after approval and commercialization of a product candidate, we remain subject to ongoing regulatory compliance and oversight to maintain our approval. Conducting our confirmatory studies could take years to complete, could yield negative or uninterpretable results or could result in an FDA determination that the studies do not provide the safety and efficacy requirements to maintain regulatory approval. If we or any of our strategic partners are unable to develop, or obtain regulatory approval for, or, if approved, maintain regulatory compliance and successfully commercialize, our product candidates, our business will be materially harmed. We are investing significant resources in the development of our novel gene therapy product candidates. Only a few gene therapy products have been approved in the U.S. and EU. If we are unable to show the safety and efficacy of these product -39- candidates , experience delays in doing so or are unable to successfully commercialize at least one of these drugs, our business would be materially harmed. We are investing significant resources in the development of our gene therapy product candidates. We believe that a significant portion of the long-term value attributed to our company by investors is based on the commercial potential of these product candidates. There can be no assurance that any development problems we experience in the future related to our gene therapy programs will not cause significant delays or unanticipated costs, or that such development problems can be solved. Initial results from ongoing clinical trials may differ materially from final results from such clinical trials. The results from preclinical and early clinical studies do not always accurately predict results in later, large-scale clinical trials. We may also experience delays in developing a sustainable, reproducible and commercial-scale manufacturing process or transferring that process to commercial partners, which may prevent us from completing our clinical trials or commercializing our products on a timely or profitable basis, if at all. In addition, the clinical trial requirements of the FDA, the EMA, and other regulatory agencies and the criteria these regulators use to determine the safety and efficacy of a product candidate vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use and market of the potential products. The regulatory approval process for novel product candidates such as ours can be more expensive and take longer than for other, better known or more extensively studied pharmaceutical or other product candidates. Currently, only a few gene therapy products have been approved in the Western world. Novartis’s and Gilead’s CAR-T therapies both received approval from the FDA in 2017. Given the few precedents of approved gene therapy products, it is difficult to determine how long it will take or how much it will cost to obtain regulatory approvals for our gene therapy product candidates in the U.S., the EU or other jurisdictions. Approvals by the EMA and the European Commission may not be indicative of what the FDA may require for approval. Regulatory requirements governing gene therapy products have evolved and may continue to change in the future. For example, on July 11, 2018, the FDA released draft guidance documents intended to reflect recent advances in the field, and to update the framework for the development, review and approval of gene therapies. These draft guidance documents pertain to the development of gene therapies for the treatment of specific disease categories, including rare diseases, and to manufacturing and long-term follow up issues relevant to gene therapy, among other topics. Furthermore, the FDA has established the Office of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies within its Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, to consolidate the review of gene therapy and related products, and the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER on its review. Gene therapy clinical trials conducted at institutions that receive funding for recombinant DNA research from the U.S. National Institutes of Health (“NIH”), are also subject to review by the NIH Office of Biotechnology Activities’ Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (“RAC”). Although the FDA decides whether individual gene therapy protocols may proceed, the RAC review process can impede the initiation of a clinical trial, even if the FDA has reviewed the study and approved its initiation. Clinical trial sites in the U.S. that receive NIH funding for research involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules are required to follow RAC recommendations, or risk losing NIH funding for such research or needing NIH pre-approval before conducting such research. In addition, the FDA can put an IND, on clinical hold if the information in an IND is not sufficient to assess the risks in pediatric patients. Before a clinical trial can begin at any institution, that institution’s institutional review board (“IRB”), and its Institutional Biosafety Committee will have to review the proposed clinical trial to assess the safety of the study. Moreover, serious adverse events or developments in clinical trials of gene therapy product candidates conducted by others may cause the FDA or other regulatory bodies to initiate a clinical hold on our clinical trials or otherwise change the requirements for approval of any of our product candidates. These regulatory review agencies, committees and advisory groups and the new requirements and guidelines they promulgate may lengthen the regulatory review process, require us to perform additional or larger studies, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of these treatment candidates or lead to significant post-approval studies, limitations or restrictions. As we advance our product candidates, we will be required to consult with these regulatory and advisory groups and comply with applicable requirements and guidelines. If we fail to do so, we may be required to delay or discontinue development of our product candidates. If the anticipated or actual timing of marketing approvals for our gene therapy product candidates, or the market acceptance of these product candidates, if approved, including treatment reimbursement levels agreed to by third-party payors, do not meet the expectations of investors or public market analysts, the market price of our common stock would likely decline. Because we are developing product candidates for the treatment of certain diseases in which there is little clinical experience and we are using new endpoints or methodologies, there is increased risk that the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory -40- authorities may not consider the endpoints of our clinical trials to provide clinically meaningful results and that these results may be difficult to analyze. During the FDA review process, we will need to identify success criteria and endpoints such that the FDA will be able to determine the clinical efficacy and safety profile of our product candidates. As we are developing novel treatments for diseases in which there is little clinical experience with new endpoints and methodologies, such as gene therapy, there is heightened risk that the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory bodies may not consider the clinical trial endpoints to provide clinically meaningful results (reflecting a tangible benefit to patients). In addition, the resulting clinical data and results may be difficult to analyze. Even if the FDA does find our success criteria to be sufficiently validated and clinically meaningful, we may not achieve the pre-specified endpoints to a degree of statistical significance. Different methodologies, assumptions and applications we utilize to assess particular safety or efficacy parameters may yield different statistical results. Even if we believe the data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates are promising, these data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities. Pre-clinical and clinical data can be interpreted in different ways. Accordingly, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities could interpret these data in different ways from us or our partners, which could delay, limit or prevent full or accelerated regulatory approval. If our study data do not consistently or sufficiently demonstrate the safety or efficacy of any of our product candidates, the regulatory approvals for such product candidates could be significantly delayed as we work to meet approval requirements, or, if we are not able to meet these requirements, such approvals could be withheld or withdrawn. Fast track product, breakthrough therapy, priority review, or Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (“RMAT”) designation by the FDA, or access to the PRIME scheme by the EMA, for our product candidates may not lead to faster development or regulatory review or approval process, and it does not increase the likelihood that our product candidates will receive marketing approval. We may seek fast track, breakthrough therapy designation, RMAT designation, PRIME scheme access or priority review designation for our product candidates if supported by the results of clinical trials. A fast track product designation is designed to facilitate the clinical development and expedite the review of drugs intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition which demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. A RMAT designation is designed to accelerate approval for regenerative advanced therapies such as our gene therapy product candidates. Priority review designation is intended to speed the FDA marketing application review timeframe for drugs that treat a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. PRIME is a scheme provided by the EMA to enhance support for the development of medicines that target an unmet medical need. For drugs and biologics that have been designated as fast track products or breakthrough therapies, or granted access to the PRIME schema, interaction and communication between the regulatory agency and the sponsor of the trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development. Sponsors of drugs with fast track products or breakthrough therapies may also be able to submit marketing applications on a rolling basis, meaning that the FDA may review portions of a marketing application before the sponsor submits the complete application to the FDA, if the sponsor pays the user fee upon submission of the first portion of the marketing application. For products that receive a priority review designation, the FDA's marketing application review goal is shortened to six months, as opposed to ten months under standard review. This review goal is based on the date the FDA accepts the marketing application for review, this application validation period typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. RMAT designations will accelerate approval but the exact mechanisms have not yet been announced by FDA. Designation as a fast track product, breakthrough therapy, RMAT, PRIME, or priority review product is within the discretion of the regulatory agency. Accordingly, even if we believe one of our product candidates meets the criteria for designation as a fast track product, breakthrough therapy, RMAT, PRIME, or priority review product, the agency may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation. In any event, the receipt of such a designation for a product candidate may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional regulatory procedures and does not assure ultimate marketing approval by the agency. In addition, regarding fast track products and breakthrough therapies, the FDA may later decide that the products no longer meet the conditions for qualification as either a fast track product, RMAT, or a breakthrough therapy or, for priority review products, decide that period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. -41- We may not be able to advance all of our programs, and w e may use our financial and human resources to pursue particular program s and fail to capitalize on programs that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success . As of December 31, 2018, our pipeline included 25 programs in various stages of development for a broad range of diseases and disorders. We plan to expand our pipeline in 2019 through internal research and development and through strategic transactions. Because we have limited resources, we may not be able to advance all of our programs. We may also forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with certain programs or for indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs for product candidates may not yield any commercially viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through strategic collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate, or we may allocate internal resources to a product candidate in a therapeutic area in which it would have been more advantageous to enter into a partnering arrangement. Risks Related to Third Parties If we are unable to maintain our agreements with third parties to distribute EXONDYS 51 to patients, our results of operations and business could be adversely affected. We rely on third parties to commercially distribute EXONDYS 51 to patients in the U.S. We have contracted with a third-party logistics company to warehouse EXONDYS 51 and with distributors and specialty pharmacies to sell and distribute it to patients. A specialty pharmacy is a pharmacy that specializes in the dispensing of medications for complex or chronic conditions that require a high level of patient education and ongoing management. This distribution network requires significant coordination with our sales and marketing and finance organizations. In addition, failure to coordinate financial systems could negatively impact our ability to accurately report product revenue from EXONDYS 51. If we are unable to effectively manage the distribution process, the sales of EXONDYS 51, as well as any future products we may commercialize, could be delayed or severely compromised and our results of operations may be harmed. In addition, the use of third parties involves certain risks, including, but not limited to, risks that these organizations will: • not provide us with accurate or timely information regarding their inventories, the number of patients who are using EXONDYS 51 or serious adverse events and/or product complaints regarding EXONDYS 51; • not effectively sell or support EXONDYS 51; • reduce or discontinue their efforts to sell or support EXONDYS 51; • not devote the resources necessary to sell EXONDYS 51 in the volumes and within the time frame we expect; • be unable to satisfy financial obligations to us or others; or • cease operations. Any such events may result in decreased product sales, lower product revenue, loss of revenue, and/or reputational damage, which would harm our results of operations and business. With respect to the pre-commercial distribution of eteplirsen to patients outside of the U.S., we have contracted with third party distributors and service providers to distribute eteplirsen in certain countries on a named patient basis and through our EAP. We will need to continue building out our network for commercial distribution in jurisdictions in which eteplirsen is approved, which will also require third party contracts. The use of distributors and service providers involves certain risks, including, but not limited to, risks that these organizations will not comply with applicable laws and regulations, or not provide us with accurate or timely information regarding serious adverse events and/or product complaints regarding eteplirsen. Any such events may result in regulatory actions that may include suspension or termination of the distribution and sale of eteplirsen in a certain country, loss of revenue, and/or reputational damage, which could harm our results of operations and business. -42- We rely on third parties to conduct some aspects of our early stage research and pre-clinical and clinical development. The inadequate performance by or loss of any of these third parties could affect the development and commercialization of our product candidate development. We have relied upon, and plan to continue to rely upon, third parties to conduct some aspects of our early stage research and pre-clinical and clinical development with respect to certain of our product candidates, including our follow-on exon-skipping product candidates, PPMO and gene therapy product candidates. Our third-party collaborators may not commit sufficient resources or adequately develop our programs for these candidates. If our third-party collaborators fail to commit sufficient resources to any of our product candidates or to carry out their contractual duties or obligations, our programs related to any particular product candidate could be delayed, terminated, or unsuccessful. Furthermore, if we fail to make required payments to these third-party collaborators, including up-front, milestone, reimbursement or royalty payments, or to observe other obligations in our agreements with them, these third parties may not be required to perform their obligations under our respective agreements with them and may have the right to terminate such agreements. We also have relied upon and plan to continue to rely upon third-party CROs to monitor and manage data for our ongoing pre-clinical and clinical programs. We rely on these parties for execution of our pre-clinical and clinical trials, and we control only certain aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol and legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on collaborators and CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. The individuals at our third-party collaborators and CROs who conduct work on our behalf, including their sub-contractors, are not always our employees, and although we participate in the planning of our early stage research and pre-clinical and clinical programs, we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources or exercise appropriate oversight of these programs, except for remedies available to us under our agreements with such third parties. If our collaborators and CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our pre-clinical and clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates. As a result, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed. Our reliance on third parties requires us to share our proprietary information, which increases the possibility that a competitor will discover them or that our proprietary information will be misappropriated or inadvertently disclosed. The use of third-party service providers requires us to disclose our proprietary information to these parties, which could increase the risk that a competitor will discover this information or that this information will be misappropriated or disclosed without our intent to do so. Furthermore, if these third parties cease to continue operations and we are not able to quickly find a replacement provider or we lose information or items associated with our product candidates, our development programs may be delayed. Although we carefully manage our relationships with our third-party collaborators and CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects. Risks Related to Manufacturing We currently rely on third parties to manufacture EXONDYS 51 and to produce our product candidates; our dependence on these parties, including any inability on our part to accurately anticipate product demand and timely secure manufacturing capacity to meet commercial, EAP, clinical and pre-clinical product demand may impair the availability of product to successfully support various programs, including research and development and the potential commercialization of our product candidates. We currently do not have the internal ability to undertake the manufacturing process for EXONDYS 51 or our product candidates in the quantities needed to meet commercial, clinical or early access programs demand for eteplirsen, or to conduct our research and development programs and conduct clinical trials for our product candidates. Therefore, we rely on, and expect to continue relying on for the foreseeable future, a limited number of third parties to manufacture and supply materials (including raw materials and subunits), API and drug product, as well as to perform additional steps in the manufacturing process, such as labeling and packaging of vials and storage of EXONDYS 51 and our product candidates. There are a limited number of third parties with facilities and capabilities suited for the manufacturing process of EXONDYS 51 and our product candidates, which creates a heightened risk that we may not be able to obtain materials and APIs in the quantity and purity that we require. In addition, the process for adding new manufacturing capacity can be lengthy and could cause delays in our development efforts. Any interruption of the development or operation of those facilities due to, among other reasons, events such as order delays for equipment or materials, equipment malfunction, quality control and quality assurance issues, regulatory delays and possible -43- negative effects of such delays on supply chains and expected timelines for product availability, production yield issues, shortages of qualified personnel, discontinuation of a facility or business or failure or damage to a facility by natural disasters such as earthquake or fire, could result in the cancellation of shipments, loss of product in the manufacturing process or a shortfall in available EXONDYS 51, product candidates or materials. If these third parties were to cease providing quality manufacturing and related services to us, and we are not able to engage appropriate replacements in a timely manner, our ability to manufacture EXONDYS 51 or our product candidates in sufficient quality and quantity required for our planned commercial, pre-clinical and clinical or early access programs use of eteplirsen would adversely affect our various product research, development and commercialization efforts. Furthermore, a ny problems in our manufacturing process or the facilities with which we contract could make us a less attractive collaborator for potential partners, including larger pharmaceutical companies and academic research institutions, which could limit our access to additional attractive development programs. Problems in third-party manufacturing processes or facilities also could restrict our ability to meet market demand for our products. We have, through our third-party manufacturers, produced or are in the process of producing supply of our product candidates and EXONDYS 51, respectively, based on our current understanding of market demands and our anticipated needs for our research and development efforts, clinical trials, early access programs and commercial sales. In light of the limited number of third parties with the expertise to produce EXONDYS 51 and our product candidates, the lead time needed to manufacture them, and the availability of underlying materials, we may not be able to, in a timely manner or at all, establish or maintain sufficient commercial and other manufacturing arrangements on the commercially reasonable terms necessary to provide adequate supply of EXONDYS 51 and our other product candidates to meet demands that meet or exceed our projected needs. Furthermore, we may not be able to obtain the significant financial capital that may be required in connection with such arrangements. Even after successfully engaging third parties to execute the manufacturing process for EXONDYS 51 and our product candidates, such parties may not comply with the terms and timelines they have agreed to for various reasons, some of which may be out of their or our control, which could impact our ability to execute our business plans on expected or required timelines in connection with the commercialization of EXONDYS 51 and the continued development of our product candidates. We may also be required to enter into long-term manufacturing agreements that contain exclusivity provisions and /or substantial termination penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business prior to and after commercialization. The third parties we use in the manufacturing process for EXONDYS 51 and our product candidates may fail to comply with current GMP (“cGMP”) regulations. Our contract manufacturers are required to produce our materials, APIs and drug products under cGMP. We and our contract manufacturers are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA, EMA and corresponding state and foreign authorities to ensure strict compliance with cGMP and other applicable government regulations. In addition, before we can begin to commercially manufacture our product candidates in third-party or our own facilities, we must obtain regulatory approval from the FDA, which includes a review of the manufacturing process and facility. A manufacturing authorization must also be obtained from the appropriate European Union regulatory authorities and may be required by other foreign regulatory authorities. The timeframe required to obtain such approval or authorization is uncertain. In order to obtain approval, we will need to ensure that all of our processes, methods and equipment are compliant with cGMP, and perform extensive audits of vendors, contract laboratories and suppliers. In complying with cGMP, we will be obligated to expend time, money and effort in production, record keeping and quality control to assure that the product meets applicable specifications and other requirements. While we work diligently with all contract manufacturers to maintain full compliance, we do not have direct control over a third-party manufacturer’s compliance with these regulations and requirements. In addition, changes in cGMP could negatively impact the ability of our contract manufacturers to complete the manufacturing process of EXONDYS 51 and our product candidates in a compliant manner on the schedule we require for commercial and clinical trial use, respectively. The failure to achieve and maintain compliance with cGMP and other applicable government regulations, including failure to detect or control anticipated or unanticipated manufacturing errors, could result in product recalls, clinical holds, delayed or withheld approvals, patient injury or death. This risk is particularly heightened as we optimize manufacturing for our product candidates. For example, we were notified by the Research Institute at Nationwide that they received a letter from the FDA on July 24, 2018, stating that their Phase 1/2a DMD micro-dystrophin gene therapy trial had been placed on clinical hold due to the presence of a trace amount of DNA fragment in research-grade third-party supplied plasmid (the “Clinical Hold”). The Research Institute, working with us, developed an action plan with immediate plans to submit for review by the FDA, which included the use of GMP-s plasmid for the program. On September 24, 2018, we announced that the FDA had lifted the Clinical Hold and that we do not anticipate any material delay to this program. If our contract manufacturers fail to adhere to applicable cGMP and other applicable government regulations, or experience manufacturing problems, we will suffer significant consequences, including product seizures or recalls, postponement or cancellation -44- of clinical trials, loss or delay of product approval, fines and sanctions, loss of revenue, termination of the development of a product candidate, reputational damage, shipment delays, inventory shortages, inventory write-offs and other product-related charges and increased manufacturing costs. If we experience any of these results, the success of our commercialization of EXONDYS 51 and/or our development efforts for our product candidates could be significantly delayed, fail or otherwise be negatively impacted. We may not be able to successfully scale up manufacturing of EXONDYS 51 or our product candidates in sufficient quality and quantity or within sufficient timelines, or be able to secure ownership of intellectual property rights developed in this process, which could negatively impact the commercial success of EXONDYS 51 and/or the development of our product candidates. We are working to increase manufacturing capacity and scale up production of some of the components of our drug products. Our focus remains on (i) achieving larger-scale manufacturing capacity for EXONDYS 51 and other product candidates throughout the manufacturing supply chain (ii) continuing to increase material and API production capacity to provide the anticipated amounts of drug product needed for our planned studies for our product candidates and (iii) optimizing manufacturing for our follow-on exon skipping product candidates and other programs, including PPMO and gene therapy. We may not be able to successfully increase manufacturing capacity or scale up the production of materials, APIs and drug products, whether in collaboration with third party manufacturers or on our own, in a manner that is safe, compliant with cGMP conditions or other applicable legal or regulatory requirements, in a cost-effective manner, in a time frame required to meet our timeline for commercialization, clinical trials and other business plans, or at all. Compliance with cGMP requirements and other quality issues may arise during our efforts to increase manufacturing capacity and scale up production with our current or any new contract manufacturers. These issues may arise in connection with the underlying materials, the inherent properties of EXONDYS 51 or a product candidate, EXONDYS 51 or a product candidate in combination with other components added during the manufacturing and packaging process or during shipping and storage of the APIs or finished drug product. In addition, in order to release EXONDYS 51 for commercial use and demonstrate stability of product candidates for use in clinical trials (and any subsequent drug products for commercial use), our manufacturing processes and analytical methods must be validated in accordance with regulatory guidelines. We may not be able to successfully validate, or maintain validation of, our manufacturing processes and analytical methods or demonstrate adequate purity, stability or comparability of EXONDYS 51 or our product candidates in a timely or cost-effective manner, or at all. If we are unable to successfully validate our manufacturing processes and analytical methods or to demonstrate adequate purity, stability or comparability, the commercial availability of EXONDYS 51 and the continued development and/or regulatory approval of our product candidates may be delayed or otherwise negatively impacted, which could significantly harm our business. During our work with our third-party manufacturers to increase and optimize manufacturing capacity and scale up production, it is possible that they could make proprietary improvements in the manufacturing and scale-up processes for EXONDYS 51 or our product candidates. We may not own or be able to secure ownership of such improvements or may have to share the intellectual property rights to those improvements. Additionally, it is possible that we will need additional processes, technologies and validation studies, which could be costly and which we may not be able to develop or acquire from third parties. Any failure to secure the intellectual property rights required for the manufacturing process needed for large-scale clinical trials or commercialization of EXONDYS 51 or the continued development of our product candidates could cause significant delays in our business plans or otherwise negatively impact the commercialization of EXONDYS 51 or the continued development of our product candidates. Products intended for use in gene therapies are novel, complex and difficult to manufacture. We could experience production problems that result in delays in our development or commercialization of gene therapy programs, limit the supply of our products or otherwise harm our business. We currently have development, manufacturing and testing agreements with third parties to manufacture supplies of our gene therapy product candidates. Several factors could cause production interruptions, including equipment malfunctions, facility contamination, raw material shortages or contamination, natural disasters, disruption in utility services, human error or disruptions in the operations of suppliers. The physical and chemical properties of biologics such as ours generally cannot be fully characterized. As a result, assays of the finished product may not be sufficient to ensure that the product will perform in the intended manner. Accordingly, we employ multiple steps to control our manufacturing process to assure that the process works and the product candidate is made strictly and consistently in compliance with the process. Problems with the manufacturing process, even minor deviations from the normal process, could result in product defects or manufacturing failures that result in lot failures, product recalls, product liability claims or insufficient inventory. We may encounter problems achieving adequate quantities and quality of clinical-grade materials that meet FDA, EMA or other applicable foreign standards or specifications with consistent and acceptable production yields and costs. -45- In addition, the FDA, the EMA and other foreign regulatory authorities may require us to submit samples of any lot of any approved product together with the protocols showing the results of applicable tests at any time. Under some circumstances, the FDA, the EMA or other foreign regulatory authorities may require that we not distribute a lot until the competent authority authorizes its release. Slight deviations in the manufacturing process, including those affecting quality attributes and stability and deviations among different sites , may result in unacceptable changes in the product that could result in lot failures or product recalls. Lot failures or product recalls could cause us to delay clinical trials or product launches which could be costly to us and otherwise harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We also may encounter problems hiring and retaining the experienced scientific, quality control and manufacturing personnel needed to operate our manufacturing process which could result in delays in our production or difficulties in maintaining compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. Furthermore, no manufacturer currently has the experience or ability to produce our vectors or gene therapy product candidates at commercial levels. Even if we timely develop a manufacturing process and successfully transfer it to the third-party vector and product manufacturers or successfully and timely develop our internal capacity, if we or such third-party manufacturers are unable to produce the necessary quantities of viral vectors and our product candidates, or in compliance with GMP or other pertinent regulatory requirements, and within our planned time frame and cost parameters, it may result in delays in our development plans or increased capital expenditures, and the development and sales of our products, if approved, may be materially harmed. Risks Related to our Intellectual Property Our success, competitive position and future revenue depend in part on our ability and the abilities of our licensors and other collaborators to obtain, maintain and defend the patent protection for our product, product candidates, and platform technologies, to preserve our trade secrets, and to prevent third parties from infringing on our proprietary rights. We currently directly hold various issued patents and patent applications, or have exclusive license or option rights to issued patents and patent applications, in each case in the U.S. as well as other countries that protect our product, product candidates and platform technologies. We anticipate filing additional patent applications both in the U.S. and in other countries. Our success will depend, in significant part, on our ability to obtain, maintain and defend our U.S. and foreign patents covering our product, product candidates and platform technologies as well as preserving our trade secrets for these assets. The patent process is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining, maintaining, or defending our patents. Even when our patent claims are allowed, the claims may not issue, or in the event of issuance, may not be sufficient to protect our product, product candidates or platform technologies. The patent positions of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. This uncertainty is heightened for our PMO-based product and product candidates and gene therapy-based product candidates for which there has been little patent litigation involving such technologies. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents has emerged to date in the U.S. and tests used for determining the patentability of patent claims in all technologies are in flux. The USPTO and patent offices in other jurisdictions have often required that patent applications concerning pharmaceutical and/or biotechnology-related inventions be limited or narrowed substantially to cover only the specific innovations exemplified in the patent application, thereby limiting the scope of protection against competitive challenges. Accordingly, even if we or our licensors are able to obtain patents, the patents might be substantially narrower than anticipated. Thus, there is no assurance as to the degree and range of protections any of our patents, if issued, may afford us or whether patents will be issued. Patents which may be issued to us may be subjected to further governmental review that may ultimately result in the reduction of their scope of protection, and pending patent applications may have their requested breadth of protection significantly limited before being issued, if issued at all. The pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences patent situation outside the U.S. can be even more uncertain. As a matter of public policy, there might be significant pressure on governmental bodies to limit the scope of patent protection or impose compulsory licenses for disease treatments that prove successful, particularly as a tactic to impose a price control. Additionally, jurisdictions other than the U.S. might have less restrictive patent laws than the U.S., giving foreign competitors the ability to exploit these laws to create, develop and market competing products. We may be able to assert that certain activities engaged in by our competitors infringe on our current or future patent rights. To the extent that we enforce our patents, an alleged infringer may deny infringement and/or counter-claim that our patents are not valid, and if successful, could negatively impact our patent estate. We may not be able to successfully defend patents necessary to prevent competitors from commercializing competing product candidates. Our patent rights might be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or otherwise not provide any competitive advantage. Defending our patent positions may require significant financial resources and could negatively impact other Company objectives. -46- Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, one or more motivated third parties may file an Abbreviated New Drug Application, seeking approval of a generic copy of an innovator product approved under the NDA pathway such as our PMO product , or a New Drug Application under Section 505(b)(2), which may be for a new or improved version of the original innovator product. The third parties are allowed to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the innovator’s product, may not need to conduct clinical trials and can market a competing version of a product after the expiration or loss of patent exclusivity or the expiration or loss of regulatory exclusivity and often charge significantly lower prices. Upon the expiration or loss of patent protection or the expiration or loss of regulatory exclusivity for a product, the major portion of revenues for that product may be dramatically reduced in a very short period of time. If we are not successful in defending our patents and regulatory exclusivities , we will not derive the expected benefit from them. The DMD patent landscape is continually evolving, and we may be able to assert that certain activities engaged in by third parties infringe our current or future patent rights. There has been, and we believe that there will continue to be, significant litigation in the biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical industries regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. As such, the patents and patent applications that we own, license, have optioned, and rely on for exclusivity for our product candidates may be challenged. Uncertainty over intellectual property in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry has been the source of litigation and other disputes, which is inherently costly and unpredictable. Litigation, interferences, oppositions, inter partes reviews, administrative challenges or other similar types of proceedings are, have been and may in the future be necessary in some instances to determine the validity and scope of certain of our proprietary rights, and in other instances to determine the validity, scope or non-infringement of certain patent rights claimed by third parties to be pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our products. We may also face challenges to our patent and regulatory exclusivities covering our products by third parties, including manufacturers of generics and biosimilars that may choose to launch or attempt to launch their products before the expiration of our patent or regulatory exclusivity. Litigation, interference, oppositions, inter partes reviews, administrative challenges or other similar types of proceedings are unpredictable and may be protracted, expensive and distracting to management. The outcome of such proceedings could adversely affect the validity and scope of our patent or other proprietary rights, hinder our ability to manufacture and market our products, require us to seek a license for the infringed product or technology or result in the assessment of significant monetary damages against us that may exceed amounts, if any, accrued in our financial statements. An adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or a failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products. Furthermore, payments under any licenses that we are able to obtain would reduce our profits derived from our products. Any of these circumstances could result in financial, business or reputational harm to us or could cause a decline or volatility in our stock price. On September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (the “Leahy-Smith Act”), was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law, including provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted, and may also affect patent litigation. The USPTO has issued regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, but many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act have only recently become effective. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. For instance, a third party may petition the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“PTAB”) seeking to challenge the validity of some or all of the claims in any of our patents through an inter partes review or other post-grant proceeding. Should the PTAB institute an inter partes review or other proceeding and decide that some or all of the claims in the challenged patent are invalid, such a decision, if upheld on appeal, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Our business prospects will be impaired if third parties successfully assert that our product, product candidates, or platform technologies infringe proprietary rights of such third parties. Similar to us, competitors continually seek intellectual property protection for their technology. Several of our development programs, particularly gene therapy programs, focus on therapeutic areas that have been the subject of extensive research and development by third parties for many years and have been protected with third party patent rights. Due to the amount of intellectual property in our various fields of technology, we cannot be certain that we do not infringe intellectual property rights of competitors or that we will not infringe intellectual property rights of competitors granted or created in the future. Our competitors might have or obtained patents that limit, interfere with or eliminate our ability to make, use and sell our product, product candidates or platform technologies in important commercial markets. In order to maintain or obtain freedom to operate for our products and product candidates, we may incur significant expenses, including those associated with entering into agreements with third parties that require milestone and royalty payments. Additionally, if we were to challenge the patent rights of our competitors, we might not be successful. -47- If our product, product candidates , or platform technologies infringe enforceable proprietary rights of others, we could incur substantial costs and may have to: • obtain rights or licenses from others, which might not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all; • abandon development of an infringing product candidate, or cease commercialization of an infringing product; • redesign our product, product candidates or processes to avoid infringement; • pay damages; and/or • defend litigation or administrative proceedings which might be costly whether we win or lose, and which could result in a substantial diversion of financial and management resources. Any of these events could result in product and product candidate development delays or cessation, and as such substantially harm our potential earnings, financial condition and operations. The patent landscape of our product candidates is continually evolving and multiple parties, including both commercial entities and academic institutions, may have rights to claims or may be pursuing additional claims that could provide these parties a basis to assert that our product, product candidates or platform technologies infringe on the intellectual property rights of such parties. There has been, and we believe that there will continue to be, significant litigation in the biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical industries regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Risks Related to our Business Operations If we fail to comply with healthcare and other regulations, we could face substantial penalties and our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. As a manufacturer of pharmaceuticals, within the United States, certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations will apply to or affect our business. The laws and regulations include: • federal healthcare program anti-kickback laws, which prohibit, among other things, persons from soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid; • federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, information or claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other third party payors that are false or fraudulent; • the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which among other things, strictly regulates drug product and medical device marketing, prohibits manufacturers from marketing such products for off-label use and regulates the distribution of samples; • federal laws that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to report certain calculated product prices to the government or provide certain discounts or rebates to government authorities or private entities, often as a condition of reimbursement under government healthcare programs; • the so-called “federal sunshine” law, which requires pharmaceutical and medical device companies to monitor and report certain financial interactions with physicians and teaching hospitals to the federal government for re-disclosure to the public; and • state law equivalents of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third party payor, including commercial insurers, state laws regulating interactions between pharmaceutical manufactures and health care providers, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by federal laws, thus complicating compliance efforts. The number and complexity of both federal and state laws continues to increase, and additional governmental resources are being used to enforce these laws and to prosecute companies and individuals who are believed to be violating them. We anticipate that government scrutiny of pharmaceutical sales and marketing practices will continue for the foreseeable future and subject us to the risk of government investigations and enforcement actions. In connection with the commercial launch of EXONDYS 51, we are in the process of expanding our compliance program, which is based on industry best practices and is designed to ensure that our commercialization of EXONDYS 51 complies with all applicable laws, regulations and industry standards. As the requirements in this area are constantly evolving, we cannot be certain that -48- our program will eliminate all areas of potential exposure. Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other laws, rules or regulations that apply to us, we will be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Responding to government investigations, defending any claims raised, and any resulting fines, restitution, damages and penalties, settlement payments or administrative actions, as well as any related actions brought by stockholders or other third parties, could have a material impact on our reputation, business and financial condition and divert the attention of our management from operating our business. Even if we successfully defend against an action against us for violation of a law, the action and our defense could nonetheless cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state privacy, security, fraud and reporting laws may prove costly. We may be subject to product liability claims and our insurance may not be adequate to cover damages. The current and future use of our product candidates by us and our collaborators in clinical trials, expanded access programs, the sale of EXONDYS 51 and future products, or the use of our products under emergency use vehicles may expose us to liability claims inherent to the manufacture, clinical testing, marketing and sale of medical products. These claims might be made directly by consumers or healthcare providers or indirectly by pharmaceutical companies, our collaborators or others selling such products. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, we may experience financial losses in the future due to such product liability claims. We have obtained commercial general liability insurance coverage for our clinical trials and the sale of commercial products in connection with the FDA’s approval of EXONDYS 51. However, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against all losses. If a successful product liability claim or series of claims is brought against us for uninsured liabilities or in excess of insured liabilities, our assets may not be sufficient to cover such claims and our business operations could be impaired. If we, our collaborators, or any third-party manufacturers engaged by us or our collaborators fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could harm our business. We, our collaborators, and any third-party manufacturers we engage are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the generation, handling, use, storage, treatment, manufacture, transportation and disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous materials and wastes, as well as laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety, including those governing laboratory procedures, exposure to blood-borne pathogens and the handling of bio-hazardous materials. Our operations involve the use of hazardous materials, including organic and inorganic solvents and reagents. Although we believe that our activities conform in all material respects with such environmental laws, there can be no assurance that violations of these laws will not occur in the future as a result of human error, accident, equipment failure or other causes. Liability under environmental, health and safety laws can be joint and several and without regard to fault or negligence. The failure to comply with past, present or future laws could result in the imposition of substantial fines and penalties, remediation costs, property damage and personal injury claims, loss of permits or a cessation of operations, and any of these events could harm our business and financial condition. We expect that our operations will be affected by other new environmental, health and workplace safety laws on an ongoing basis, and although we cannot predict the ultimate impact of any such new laws, they may impose greater compliance costs or result in increased risks or penalties, which could harm our business. Further, with respect to the operations of any current or future collaborators or third party contract manufacturers, it is possible that if they fail to operate in compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or properly dispose of wastes associated with our product or product candidates, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, suffer reputational harm or experience a disruption in the manufacture and supply of our product or product candidates. The EU has enacted a new data privacy regulation, the General Data Protection Regulation, a violation of which could subject us to significant fines. In May 2018, a new privacy regime, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) will take effect and immediately be binding across all member states of the European Economic Area (“EEA”). The GDPR increases our obligations with respect to clinical trials conducted in the EEA by expanding the definition of personal data to include coded data, and requiring changes to informed consent practices and more detailed notices for clinical trial subjects and investigators. In addition, the GDPR increases the scrutiny that clinical trial sites located in the EEA should apply to transfers of personal data from such sites to countries that are considered to lack an adequate level of data protection, such as the U.S. The GDPR imposes substantial fines for breaches of data protection requirements, which can be up to four percent of global revenue or 20 million Euros, whichever is greater, and it also confers a private right of action on data subjects for breaches of data protection requirements. Compliance with these directives will be -49- a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase our cost of doing business, and despite those efforts, there is a risk that we may be subject to fines and penalties, litigation and reputational harm in connection with our European activities. If we fail to retain our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional qualified personnel, our future growth and our ability to compete would suffer. We are highly dependent on the efforts and abilities of the principal members of our senior management. Additionally, we have scientific personnel with significant and unique expertise in RNA-targeted therapeutics and gene therapy technologies. The loss of the services of any one of the principal members of our managerial team or staff may prevent us from achieving our business objectives. The competition for qualified personnel in the biotechnology field is intense, and our future success depends upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate such personnel. In order to develop and commercialize our products successfully, we will be required to retain key management and scientific employees. In certain instances, we may also need to expand or replace our workforce and our management ranks. In addition, we rely on certain consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in the formulation and advancement of our research and development programs. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by other entities or have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with third parties that limit their availability to us, or both. If we are unable to attract, assimilate or retain such key personnel, our ability to advance our programs would be adversely affected. We expect to expand our organization and may experience difficulties in managing this growth, which could disrupt our operations. As of December 31, 2018, we had 499 full-time employees. As our business activities expand, we expect to expand our full-time employee base and to hire more consultants and contractors. Our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. Our ability to manage our growth properly and maintain compliance with all applicable rules and regulations will require us to continue to improve our operational, legal, financial and management controls, as well as our reporting systems and procedures. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Our expected growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of additional product candidates. If our management is unable to effectively manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate and/or grow revenues could be reduced, and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally. We are increasing our presence in international markets, including emerging markets, subjecting us to many risks that could adversely affect our business and revenues, such as: • the inability to obtain necessary foreign regulatory or pricing approvals of products in a timely manner; • uncertainties regarding the collectability of accounts receivable; • fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that may adversely impact our revenues, net income and value of certain of our investments; • difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; • the imposition of governmental controls; • less favorable intellectual property or other applicable laws; • increasingly complex standards for complying with foreign laws and regulations that may differ substantially from country to country and may conflict with corresponding U.S. laws and regulations; • the far-reaching anti-bribery and anti-corruption legislation in the U.K., including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, and elsewhere and escalation of investigations and prosecutions pursuant to such laws; • compliance with complex import and export control laws; • restrictions on direct investments by foreign entities and trade restrictions; and • changes in tax laws and tariffs. -50- In addition, our international operations are subject to regulation under U.S. law. For example, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from paying, offering to pay, promising to pay or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to otherwise obtain favorable treatment or influence a person working in an official capacity. In many countries, the health care professionals we regularly interact with may meet the FCPA's definition of a foreign government official. Failure to comply with domestic or foreign laws could result in various adverse consequences, including: possible delay in approval or refusal to approve a product, recalls, seizures or withdrawal of an approved product from the market, disruption in the supply or availability of our products or suspension of export or import privileges, the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions, the prosecution of executives overseeing our international operations and damage to our reputation. Any significant impairment of our ability to sell products outside of the U.S. could adversely impact our business and financial results. Unfavorable global economic conditions could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our results of operations could be harmed by general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets. A severe or prolonged economic downturn could result in a variety of risks to our business, including weakened demand for our product candidates and our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. For example, the global financial crisis of 2007-2008 and the ongoing European economic crisis caused extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. A weak or declining economy could strain our manufacturers, possibly resulting in manufacturing disruption, or cause delays in payments for our services by third-party payors or our future collaborators. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the current economic climate and financial market conditions could harm our business. Additionally, in June 2016, a majority of United Kingdom (UK) voters voted for the UK to exit the European Union (Brexit) and in March 2017, the UK government provided official legal notification to the European Union that the UK will exit the European Union. The timing and completion of Brexit is subject to judicial and parliamentary developments in the UK, as well as any legal challenges. The economic effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the UK makes to retain access to European Union markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. Brexit could adversely affect European and worldwide economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial markets. Brexit is likely to lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the UK determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate. Any of these effects of Brexit, and any other effects we cannot anticipate, could adversely affect our business, business opportunities, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology, including any cyber security incidents, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of EXONDYS 51 patients, clinical trial participants and employees. Similarly, our third-party providers possess certain of our sensitive data. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information, including our data being breached at third party providers, could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt our operations and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business. We may incur substantial costs in connection with litigation and other disputes. In the ordinary course of business we may, and in some cases have, become involved in lawsuits and other disputes such as securities claims, intellectual property challenges, including interferences declared by the USPTO, and employee matters. It is possible that we may not prevail in claims made against us in such disputes even after expending significant amounts of money and company resources in defending our positions in such lawsuits and disputes. The outcome of such lawsuits and disputes is inherently uncertain and may have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Comprehensive tax reform in the United States could adversely affect our business and financial condition. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”) was enacted on December 22, 2017 in the United States. The TCJA contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, elimination of U.S. tax on foreign earnings (subject to certain important exceptions), one-time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense, immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits. -51- We continue to evaluate the overall impact of the TCJA on our business. There is continued uncertainty in the TCJA, and although changes or challenges cannot be predicted, we believe we have used reasonable assumptions and interpretations in applying TCJA. We continue to monitor for legislative developments, issuance of regulations and technical memorandum to provide further clarification and/or interpretations of the TCJA and will adjust our financial statements as needed . Our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset future taxable income may be limited as a result of future transactions involving our common stock. In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, a corporation that undergoes an ‘‘ownership change’’ is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses and certain other tax assets to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders increases by more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders’ lowest percentage ownership during the testing period, which is generally three years. An ownership change could limit our ability to utilize our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for taxable years including or following such “ownership change.” Limitations imposed on the ability to use net operating losses and tax credits to offset future taxable income could require us to pay U.S. federal income taxes earlier than we estimated or than would have otherwise been required if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such net operating losses and tax credits to expire unused, in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such net operating losses and tax credits and potentially adversely affecting our financial position. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes. We are winding down our expired U.S. government contracts, and the U.S. government may deny payment of some or all of the currently outstanding amounts owed to us. In addition, further development of our infectious disease programs may be limited by the intellectual property and other rights retained by the U.S. government. We have historically relied on U.S. government contracts and awards to fund and support certain infectious disease development programs. These contracts are expired and we are currently involved in contract close-out activities. The U.S. government has the right to perform additional audits prior to making final payment of costs and fees. If we are not able to adequately support costs incurred or other government requirements, the government may deny payment of some or all of the currently outstanding amounts owed to us. In addition, the U.S. government may have the right to develop all or some parts of product candidates that we have developed under a U.S. government contract after such contract has terminated or expired. Our employees, principal investigators, consultants and strategic partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading. We are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees, principal investigators, consultants and strategic partners. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional failures to comply with the regulations of the FDA and non-U.S. regulators, provide accurate information to the FDA and non-U.S. regulators, comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. We adopted a code of conduct applicable to all of our employees, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions. The increasing use of social media platforms presents new risks and challenges. Social media is increasingly being used to communicate about our product, technologies and programs, and the diseases our product and product candidates are designed to treat. Social media practices in the biopharmaceutical industry continue to evolve and regulations relating to such use are not always clear. This evolution creates uncertainty and risk of noncompliance with regulations applicable to our business. For example, patients may use social media channels to comment on the effectiveness of a product or to report an alleged adverse event. When such disclosures occur, there is a risk that we fail to monitor and comply with applicable adverse event reporting obligations or we may not be able to defend the Company or the public's legitimate interests in the face of the political and market pressures generated by social media due to restrictions on what we may say about our product and/or product candidates. There is also a risk of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information or negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us on any social networking website. If any of these events were to occur or we otherwise fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could incur liability, face overly restrictive regulatory actions or incur other harm to our business. -52- We or the third parties upon whom we depend may be adversely affected by natural disasters and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster. Natural disasters could severely disrupt our operations, and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. If a natural disaster, power outage or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our office, manufacturing and/or lab spaces, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as the manufacturing facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place may prove inadequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Risks Related to our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements We have incurred operating losses since our inception and we may not achieve or sustain profitability. We incurred an operating loss of $343.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, respectively. Our accumulated deficit was $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2018. Although we launched EXONDYS 51 in the U.S. in September 2016, we believe that it will take us some time to attain profitability and positive cash flow from operations. Since EXONDYS 51 and our product candidates target small patient populations, the per-patient drug pricing must be high in order to recover our development and manufacturing costs, fund adequate patient support programs, fund additional research and achieve profitability. We may be unable to maintain or obtain sufficient sales volumes at a price high enough to justify our product development efforts and our sales, marketing and manufacturing expenses. We have generally incurred expenses related to research and development of our technologies and product candidates and from general and administrative expenses that we have incurred while building our business infrastructure. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if and/or as we: • continue our launch and commercialization of EXONDYS 51 in the U.S.; • expand the global footprint of EXONDYS 51 outside of the U.S.; • establish our sales, marketing and distribution capabilities; • continue our research, pre-clinical and clinical development of our product candidates; • respond to and satisfy requests and requirements from regulatory authorities in connection with development and potential approval of our product candidates; • initiate additional clinical trials for our product candidates; • seek marketing approvals for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; • acquire or in-license other product candidates; • maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; • increase manufacturing capabilities including capital expenditures related to our real estate facilities and entering into manufacturing agreements; • hire additional clinical, quality control and scientific personnel; and • add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and planned future commercialization efforts. As a result, we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses at least through 2018. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when, or if, we will become profitable. We will need to raise additional funding, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed may force us to delay, limit or terminate our product development efforts or other operations. We will likely require additional capital from time to time in the future in order to meet FDA post-marketing approval requirements and market and sell EXONDYS 51 as well as to continue the development of product candidates in our pipeline, to prepare for potential commercialization of our product candidates, to expand our product portfolio and to continue or enhance our -53- business development efforts. The actual amount of funds that we may need and the sufficiency of the capital we have or are able to raise will be determined by many factors, some of which are in our control and others that are beyond our control. While we are currently well capitalized, we may use available capital resources sooner than we expect under our current operating plan. In addition, our operating plan may change. We may need or choose to seek additional funds sooner than planned, through equity or debt financings, government or other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements or a combination of these approaches. In any event, we expect to require additional capital to expand future development efforts, obtain regulatory approval for, and to commercialize, our product candidates. Raising funds in the current economic environment may present additional challenges. Even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans, we may seek additional capital if market conditions are favorable or in light of specific strategic considerations. Any additional fundraising efforts may divert our management from their day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates. In addition, we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In the event we receive negative data from our key clinical programs or encounter other major setbacks in our development or regulatory activities or in our commercialization efforts, if any of our product candidates are approved, our stock price is likely to decline which would make a future financing more difficult. Moreover, the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders. The issuance of additional securities, whether equity or debt, by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our shares to decline. The sale of additional equity or convertible securities would dilute all of our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and we may be required to agree to certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. We could also be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or otherwise at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable and we may be required to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product candidates or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects. If we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, we may be required to significantly curtail, delay or discontinue one or more of our research or development programs or the commercialization of any product, if approved, or be unable to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, as desired, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Raising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights. We may seek additional capital through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations and strategic and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of common stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock, the ownership interest of our stockholders in our company will be diluted. In addition, the terms of any such securities may include liquidation or other preferences that materially adversely affect the rights of our stockholders. Debt financing, if available, would increase our fixed payment obligations and may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaboration, strategic partnerships and licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our product candidates, our intellectual property, future revenue streams or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. The estimates and judgments we make, or the assumptions on which we rely, in preparing our consolidated financial statements could prove inaccurate. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the amounts of charges accrued by us and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Such estimates and judgments include revenue recognition, inventory, valuation of stock-based awards, research and development expenses and income tax. We base our estimates on historical experience, facts and circumstances known to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We cannot provide assurances, however, that our estimates, or the assumptions underlying them, will not change over time or otherwise prove inaccurate. If this is the case, we may be required to restate our consolidated financial statements, which could, in turn, subject us to securities class action litigation. Defending against such potential litigation relating to a restatement of our consolidated financial statements would be expensive and would require significant attention and resources of our management. Moreover, our insurance to cover our obligations with respect to the ultimate resolution of any such litigation may be inadequate. As a result of these factors, any such potential litigation could have a -54- material adverse effect on our financial results and cause our stock price to decline, which could in turn subject us to securities class action litigation. Risks Related to Our Common Stock Our stock price is volatile and may fluctuate due to factors beyond our control. The market prices for and trading volumes of securities of biotechnology companies, including our securities, has historically been volatile. Our stock has had significant swings in trading prices, in particular in connection with our public communications regarding feedback received from regulatory authorities. For example, over the last thirty eight months, our stock has increased as much as 74% in a single day or decreased as much as 55% in a single day. The market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors, including but not limited to: • the commercial performance of EXONDYS 51 in the U.S.; • the timing of our submissions to regulatory authorities and regulatory decisions and developments; • positive or negative clinical trial results or regulatory interpretations of data collected in clinical trials conducted by us, our strategic partners, our competitors or other companies with investigational drugs targeting the same, similar or related diseases to those targeted by us; • delays in beginning and completing pre-clinical and clinical trials for potential product candidates; • delays in entering or failing to enter into strategic relationships with respect to development and/or commercialization of EXONDYS 51 or our product candidates or entry into strategic relationships on terms that are not deemed to be favorable to our Company; • technological innovations, product development or additional commercial product introductions by ourselves or competitors; • changes in applicable government regulations or regulatory requirements in the approval process; • developments concerning proprietary rights, including patents and patent litigation matters, such as developments in the interferences declared by the USPTO, including in the near term any outcomes of ongoing interference proceedings and over the longer term the outcomes from any related appeals; • public concern relating to the commercial value, efficacy or safety of any of our products; • our ability to obtain funds, through the issuance of equity or equity linked securities or incurrence of debt, or other corporate transactions; • comments by securities analysts; • developments in litigation such as the stockholder lawsuits against us; • changes in senior management; or • general market conditions in our industry or in the economy as a whole. Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of a company’s stock, including ours, regardless of actual operating performance. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources. Our revenues and operating results could fluctuate significantly, which may adversely affect our stock price. Our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from year-to-year and quarter-to-quarter as well as in comparison to the corresponding quarter of the preceding year. Variations my result from one or more factors, including, without limitation: • timing of purchase orders; • changes in coverage and reimbursement policies of health plans and other health insurers, especially in relation to those products that are currently manufactured, under development or identified for future development by us; • re-authorizations processes that may be required for patients who initially obtained coverage by third parties, including government payors, managed care organizations and private health insurers; -55- • transition from temporary billing codes established by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to permanent medical codes; • timing of approval of applications filed with the FDA; • timing of product launches and market acceptance of products launched; • changes in the amounts spent to research, develop, acquire, license or promote new and existing products; • results of clinical trial programs; • serious or unexpected health or safety concerns with our product or product candidates; • introduction of new products by others that render our product obsolete or noncompetitive; • the ability to maintain selling prices and gross margin on our product; • increases in the cost of raw materials contained within our product; • manufacturing and supply interruptions, including product rejections or recalls due to failure to comply with manufacturing specifications; • timing of revenue recognition relating to our distribution agreements; • the ability to protect our intellectual property from being acquired by other entities; • the ability to avoid infringing the intellectual property of others; and • the addition or loss of customers. In addition, in one or more future periods, our results of operations may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline. Provisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law might deter acquisition bids for us that might be considered favorable and prevent or frustrate any attempt to replace or remove the then-current management and board of directors. Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or effect a change in our board of directors and management. These provisions include: • when the board is comprised of six or more directors, classification of our board of directors into two classes, with one class elected each year; • directors may only be removed for cause by the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of all the then-outstanding shares of voting stock; • prohibition of cumulative voting of shares in the election of directors; • right of the board of directors to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death, disqualification or removal of a director; • express authorization of the board of directors to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; • prohibition on stockholder action by written consent; • advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings; • the ability of our board of directors to authorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms and rights of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, including rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock; and • a super-majority (66 2/3%) of the voting power of all of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock are required to amend, rescind, alter or repeal our bylaws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation. In addition, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws and in the Delaware General Corporation Law could make it more difficult for -56- stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our board of directors or initiate actions that are opposed by the then-current board of directors. A significant number of shares of our common stock are issuable pursuant to outstanding stock awards, and we expect to issue additional stock awards and shares of common stock in the future. Exercise of these awards and sales of shares will dilute the interests of existing security holders and may depress the price of our common stock. As of December 31, 2018, there were approximately 71.1million shares of common stock outstanding and outstanding awards to purchase 9.1 million shares of common stock under various incentive stock plans. Additionally, as of December 31, 2018, there were approximately 4.4 million shares of common stock available for future issuance under our 2018 Equity Incentive Plan, approximately 0.2 million shares of common stock available for issuance under our 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and approximately 0.9 million shares of common stock available for issuance under our 2014 Employment Commencement Incentive Plan. We may issue additional common stock and warrants from time to time to finance our operations. We may also issue additional shares to fund potential acquisitions or in connection with additional stock options or other equity awards granted to our employees, officers, directors and consultants under our 2018 Equity Incentive Plan, our 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan or our 2014 Employment Commencement Incentive Plan. The issuance of additional shares of common stock or warrants to purchase common stock and the perception that such issuances may occur or exercise of outstanding warrants or stock options may have a dilutive impact on other stockholders and could have a material negative effect on the market price of our common stock. Future sales of our common stock in the public market could cause our share price to fall. Sales of a substantial number of our common stock in the public market, including sales by members of our management or board of directors, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity or equity-related securities. Risks Related to Our Convertible Senior Notes Servicing our 1.50% notes due 2024 (the “Notes”) requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow to pay our debt. In 2017, we issued $570 million aggregate principal amount of Notes. Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to many factors, including, economic, financial, competitive and other, beyond our control. We do not expect our business to be able to generate cash flow from operations, in the foreseeable future, sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures and may therefore be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our Notes, which are non-callable and mature in 2024, will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations, and limit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business. We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to repurchase the Notes as required upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to repurchase the Notes. Holders of the Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their Notes for cash upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. A fundamental change may also constitute an event of default or prepayment under, and result in the acceleration of the maturity of, our then-existing indebtedness. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient financial resources, or will be able to arrange financing, to pay the fundamental change repurchase price in cash with respect to any Notes surrendered by holders for repurchase upon a fundamental change. In addition, restrictions under our then existing credit facilities or other indebtedness, if any, may not allow us to repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change. Our failure to repurchase the Notes upon a fundamental change when required would result in an event of default with respect to the Notes which could, in turn, constitute a default under the terms of our other indebtedness, if any. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Notes. Capped call transactions entered into in connection with our Notes may impact the value of our common stock. In connection with the Notes, we entered into capped call transactions (the “capped call transactions”) with certain financial institutions. The capped call transactions are expected to generally reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the Notes into shares of our common stock. -57- In connection with establishing their initial hedges of the capped call transactions, these financial institutions or their respective affiliates entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock and/or to purchase our common stock. The financial institutions, or their respective affiliates, may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Notes. This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the Notes, which could affect the value of our common stock. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. None. Item 2. Properties. A description of the facilities we own and/or occupy is included in the following table.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis o f Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Please review our legend titled “Forward-Looking Information” at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K which is incorporated herein by reference. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below, and those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Throughout this discussion, unless the context specifies or implies otherwise, the terms “Sarepta”, “we”, “us” and “our” refer to Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Overview We are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on helping patients through the discovery and development of unique RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene therapy and other genetic therapeutic modalities for the treatment of rare diseases. Applying our proprietary, highly-differentiated and innovative technologies, and through collaborations with our strategic partners, we are developing potential therapeutic candidates for a broad range of diseases and disorders, including DMD, LGMDs, CMT , MPS IIIA and Pompe. Our first commercial product in the U.S., EXONDYS 51, was granted accelerated approval by the FDA on September 19, 2016. EXONDYS 51 is indicated for the treatment of DMD in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 51 skipping. EXONDYS 51 uses our PMO chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 51 of the dystrophin gene. EXONDYS51 is designed to bind to exon 51 of dystrophin pre- messenger RNA (“mRNA”), resulting in exclusion of this exon during mRNA processing in patients with genetic mutations that are amenable to exon 51 skipping. Exon skipping is intended to promote the production of an internally truncated but functional dystrophin protein. A summary description of our main product candidates, including those in collaboration with our strategic partners, is as follows: • Golodirsen (SRP-4053) uses our PMO chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 53 of the DMD gene. Golodirsen is designed to bind to exon 53 of dystrophin pre-mRNA, resulting in exclusion, or “skipping”, of this exon during mRNA processing in patients with genetic mutations that are amenable to exon 53 skipping. We are enrolling and dosing patients in ESSENCE (4045-301), our Phase 3 placebo controlled confirmatory trial in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 45 or 53 skipping using casimersen and golodirsen, respectively. Golodirsen is also being evaluated in a Phase 1/2 trial having two parts. Part I of the Phase 1/2 trial has been completed, and Part II, an open-label portion of the trial, is expected to be completed in 2019 (Study 4053-101). In September 2017, we announced positive results of an analysis that included biopsies of the bicep muscle at baseline and on-treatment at the Part II, Week 48 time point. The 4053-101 interim trial results demonstrated statistical significance on all primary and secondary biological endpoints. In December 2018, we completed the submission of our rolling NDA to the FDA seeking accelerated approval for golodirsen. The FDA accepted the NDA and granted priority review status for golodirsen with a targeted regulatory action date of August 19, 2019. The FDA also indicated that it does not intend to conduct an advisory board for golodirsen. • Casimersen (SRP-4045) uses our PMO chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 45 of the DMD gene. Casimersen is designed to bind to exon 45 of dystrophin pre-mRNA, resulting in exclusion, or “skipping”, of this exon during mRNA processing in patients with genetic mutations that are amenable to exon 45 skipping. We are enrolling and dosing patients in ESSENCE, further described above. We have completed a dose titration portion (Phase 1) and the open-label portion (Phase 2) of a Sarepta sponsored Phase 1/2 the trial clinical trial studying casimersen (4045-101). We anticipate submitting an NDA to the FDA for casimersen in 2019 if we believe the results of an interim dystrophin analysis in the ESSENCE study are positive. • SRP-5051 uses our next-generation chemistry platform, PPMO, and our exon-skipping technology to skip exon 51 of the DMD gene. SRP-5051, a peptide conjugated PMO, is designed to bind to exon 51 of dystrophin pre-mRNA, resulting in exclusion of this exon during mRNA processing in patients with genetic mutations that are amenable to exon 51 skipping. Exon skipping is intended to promote the production of an internally truncated but functional dystrophin protein. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we received clearance from the FDA and commenced a first-in-human, single ascending dose, study for the treatment of DMD in patients who are amenable to exon 51 skipping. We expect to complete this study in 2019. • SRP-9001 (micro-dystrophin gene therapy program) , in collaboration with Nationwide, aims to express micro-dystrophin – a smaller but still functional version of dystrophin. A unique, engineered micro-dystrophin is used because naturally-occurring dystrophin is too large to fit in an AAV vector. In the fourth quarter of 2017, an IND application for the micro- -61- dystrophin gene therapy program was cleared by the FDA, and a Phase 1/2a clinical trial in individuals with DMD was initiated . On October 3, 2018, Nationwide presented positive results from the Phase 1/2a clinical trial in four individuals with DMD enrolled in the trial. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we commenced a placebo-controlled trial with the goal to establish the functional benefits of micro-dystrophin expressions. W e plan to conduct a confirmatory trial using commercial supply of SRP-9001 by the end of 2019 , pending regulatory feedback. • MYO-101 . Myonexus, one of our strategic partners, develops gene therapy programs for various forms of LGMDs. The most advanced of Myonexus’ product candidates, MYO-101, is designed to transfer a gene that codes for and restores beta-sarcoglycan protein with the goal of restoring the dystrophin associated protein complex. It utilizes the AAVrh.74 vector system, the same vector used in the micro-dystrophin gene therapy program we are developing with Nationwide. Myonexus commenced a Phase 1/2a trial of MYO-101 in the fourth quarter of 2018, and on February 27, 2019, we announced positive two-month data from the first three-patient cohort dosed in the MYO-101 trial. • GALGT2 . An additional gene therapy program for DMD and other muscular dystrophies, also in collaboration with Nationwide, aims to express the enzyme GALGT2 from an AAV vector. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the IND application for GALGT2 was cleared by the FDA, and a Phase 1/2a clinical trial testing GALGT2 for the treatment of DMD was initiated. • LYS-SAF 302 . We are collaborating with Lysogene to develop a gene therapy, LYS-SAF302, to treat MPS IIIA. The first patient has been dosed in AAVance, a global Phase 2/3 clinical trial of LYS-SAF302, aiming at evaluating the effectiveness of a one-time delivery of a AAVrh10 virus carrying the N-SGSH gene. • Neutrophin 3 (CMT Type 1A) . A gene therapy program in collaboration with Nationwide that aims to express NT-3 encoding the NTF3 gene to treat CMT neuropathies, including CMT type 1A. A clinical trial to test NT-3 gene therapy is planned to commence dosing in 2019 for CMT type 1A, pending regulatory feedback. We believe that the delivery of NT-3 gene may have applicability to other sub-types of CMT in addition to other muscle-wasting diseases. Our pipeline includes 25 programs in various stages of pre-clinical and clinical development, reflecting our aspiration to apply our multifaceted approach and expertise in precision genetic medicine to make a profound difference in the lives of patients suffering from rare diseases. We have developed proprietary state-of-the-art CMC and manufacturing capabilities that allow synthesis and purification of our product candidates to support both clinical development as well as commercialization. Our current main focus in manufacturing is to continue scaling up production of our PMO-based therapies and optimizing manufacturing for PPMO and gene therapy-based product candidates. We have entered into certain manufacturing and supply arrangements with third-party suppliers which will in part utilize these capabilities to support production of certain of our product candidates and their components. In 2017, we opened a facility in Andover, Massachusetts, which significantly enhances our research and development manufacturing capabilities. However, we currently do not have internal large scale GMP manufacturing capabilities to produce our product and product candidates for commercial and/or clinical use. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $1,174.9 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments, consisting of $370.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, $803.1 million of short-term investments and $1.0 million of long-term restricted investment. We believe that our balance of cash, cash equivalents and investments is sufficient to fund our current operational plan for at least the next twelve months. The likelihood of our long-term success must be considered in light of the expenses, difficulties and delays frequently encountered in the development and commercialization of new pharmaceutical products, competitive factors in the marketplace and the complex regulatory environment in which we operate. We may never achieve significant revenue or profitable operations. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities for the periods presented. Some of these judgments can be subjective and complex, and, consequently, actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe that the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon historical experience and information available to us at the time that we make these estimates and judgments. To the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our consolidated financial statements will be affected. Although we believe that our judgments and -62- estimates are appropriate, actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements: • revenue recognition; • i nventory; • stock-based compensation; and • income tax. Revenue Recognition To determine revenue recognition for arrangements within the scope of ASC 606, we perform the following five steps: (1) identify the contracts with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation. Variable Consideration Product revenues are recorded at the net sales price (transaction price) which includes estimated reserves for variable consideration, such as Medicaid rebates, governmental chargebacks, including Public Health Service (“PHS”) chargebacks, prompt payment discounts, co-pay assistance and distribution fees. These reserves are based on the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if no payment is required by us) or a current liability (if a payment is required by us). These reserves reflect our best estimates of the amount of consideration to which we are entitled based on the terms of the contracts. Additional details relating to variable consideration follows: • Medicaid rebates relate to our estimated obligations to states under established reimbursement arrangements. Rebate reserves are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a liability which is included in accrued expenses. • Governmental chargebacks, including PHS chargebacks, relate to our estimated obligations resulting from contractual commitments to sell products to qualified healthcare providers at prices lower than the list prices that we charge to wholesalers. The wholesaler charges us for the difference between what the wholesaler pays for the products and the ultimate selling price to the qualified healthcare providers. Chargeback reserves are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and accounts receivable. Chargeback amounts are generally determined at the time of resale to the qualified healthcare provider from the wholesaler, and we generally issue credits for such amounts within a few weeks of receiving notification of resale from the wholesaler. • Prompt payment discounts relate to our estimated obligations for credits to be granted to a specialty pharmacy for remitting payment on its purchases within established incentive periods. Reserves for prompt payment discounts are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and accounts receivable. • Co-pay assistance relates to financial assistance provided to qualified patients, whereby we may assist them with prescription drug co-payments required by the patient’s insurance provider. Reserves for co-pay assistance are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a liability which is included in accrued expenses. • Distribution fees relate to fees paid to Customers in the distribution channel that provide us with inventory management, data and distribution services and are generally accounted for as a reduction of revenue. To the extent that the services received are distinct from our sale of products to the Customer, these payments are accounted for as selling, general and administrative expenses. Reserves for distribution fees result in an increase in a liability if payments are required of us or a reduction of accounts receivable if no payments are required of us. Please read Note 7, Accounts Receivable and Reserves for Product Sales to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of revenue recognition. Inventory Valuation We periodically analyze our inventory levels, and write down inventory that has become obsolete, inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its estimated net realizable value and inventory in excess of expected sales requirements as cost of sales. The determination of whether inventory costs will be realizable requires estimates by management. If actual market conditions are less favorable than projected by management, additional write-downs of inventory may be required. -63- Stock Compensation Expense For stock awards with performance conditions, determining the appropriate amount to expense based on the anticipated achievement of performance targets requires judgment, including forecasting the achievement of future financial targets. The estimate of expense is revised periodically based on the probability of achieving the required performance targets and adjustments are made throughout the term as appropriate. The cumulative impact of any revision is reflected in the period of change. Please read Note 16, Stock-Based Compensation to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of stock-based compensation. Income Tax The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon an examination. The calculation of our tax liabilities resulting from uncertain tax positions can involve significant judgment. Further, the calculation may involve the application of complex tax regulations in a foreign jurisdiction. Although we believe that we have adequately provided for tax liabilities resulting from uncertain tax positions, the actual amounts paid, if any, could have a material impact on our results of operations. Interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions are classified as a component of income tax expense. Please read Note 2, Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates. -64- The following table sets forth selected consolidated statements of operations data for each of the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31 2018 2017 Change Change (in thousands, except per share amounts) $ % Revenues: Product, net $ 301,034 $ 154,584 $ 146,450 95 % Total revenues 301,034 154,584 146,450 95 % Cost and expenses: Cost of sales (excluding amortization of in-licensed rights) 34,193 7,353 26,840 365 % Research and development 401,843 166,707 235,136 141 % Selling, general and administrative 207,761 122,682 85,079 69 % EXONDYS 51 settlement and license charges — 28,427 (28,427 ) (100 )% Amortization of in-licensed rights 865 1,053 (188 ) (18 )% Total cost and expenses 644,662 326,222 318,440 98 % Operating loss (343,628 ) (171,638 ) (171,990 ) 100 % Other (loss) income: Interest expense and other, net (18,982 ) (1,990 ) (16,992 ) NM* Gain from sale of Priority Review Voucher — 125,000 (125,000 ) (100 )% Loss before income tax (benefit) expense (362,610 ) (48,628 ) (313,982 ) NM* Income tax (benefit) expense (692 ) 2,060 (2,752 ) (134 )% Net loss $ (361,918 ) $ (50,688 ) $ (311,230 ) NM* Net loss per share — basic and diluted $ (5.46 ) $ (0.86 ) $ (4.60 ) NM* For the Year Ended December 31 2017 2016 Change Change (in thousands, except per share amounts) $ % Revenues: Product, net $ 154,584 $ 5,421 $ 149,163 NM* Total revenues 154,584 5,421 149,163 NM* Cost and expenses: Cost of sales (excluding amortization of in-licensed rights) 7,353 101 7,252 NM* Research and development 166,707 188,272 (21,565 ) (11 )% Selling, general and administrative 122,682 83,749 38,933 46 % EXONDYS 51 settlement and license charges 28,427 — 28,427 NM* Amortization of in-licensed rights 1,053 29 1,024 NM* Total cost and expenses 326,222 272,151 54,071 20 % Operating loss (171,638 ) (266,730 ) 95,092 (36 )% Other (loss) income: Interest expense and other, net (1,990 ) (535 ) (1,455 ) 272 % Gain from sale of Priority Review Voucher 125,000 — 125,000 NM* Loss before income tax expense (48,628 ) (267,265 ) $ 218,637 (82 )% Income tax expense 2,060 — $ 2,060 NM* Net loss $ (50,688 ) $ (267,265 ) $ 216,577 (81 )% Net loss per share — basic and diluted $ (0.86 ) $ (5.49 ) $ 4.63 (84 )% * NM: not meaningful -65- Revenues Revenues from product sales are recorded at the net sales price (transaction price), which includes estimates of variable consideration for which reserves are established and which result from Medicaid rebates, governmental chargebacks, including PHS chargebacks, prompt pay discounts, co-pay assistance and distribution fees. These reserves are based on the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if no payments are required of us) or a current liability (if a payment is required of us). These reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. Our estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements. The amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price may be constrained, and is included in the net sales price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur in a future period. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received or paid may differ from our estimates. If actual results in the future vary from our estimates, we will adjust these estimates, which would affect net product revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known. Net product revenues for EXONDYS 51 for 2018 increased by $146.5 million compared with 2017. Net product revenues for EXONDYS 51 for 2017 increased by $149.2 million compared with 2016. The increases primarily reflect the continuing increase in demand for EXONDYS 51 in the U.S. Cost of Sales Our cost of sales relates to sales of EXONDYS 51 following its commercial launch in the U.S. Prior to receiving regulatory approval for EXONDYS 51 by the FDA in September 2016, we expensed such manufacturing and material costs as research and development expenses. For EXONDYS 51 sold in 2017 and 2016, the majority of related manufacturing costs incurred had previously been expensed as research and development expenses, as such costs were incurred prior to the FDA approval of EXONDYS 51. For EXONDYS 51 sold in 2018, only part of the related manufacturing costs incurred had previously been expensed as research and development expenses. The following table summarizes the components of our cost of sales for the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31 2018 2017 Change Change (in thousands) $ % Royalty payments to BioMarin $ 15,065 $ 4,719 $ 10,346 219 % Inventory costs related to EXONDYS 51 sold 8,616 414 8,202 NM* Overhead costs 4,754 1,387 3,367 243 % Other inventory costs 5,758 833 4,925 NM* Total cost of sales $ 34,193 $ 7,353 $ 26,840 365 % For the Year Ended December 31 2017 2016 Change Change (in thousands) $ % Royalty payments to BioMarin $ 4,719 $ — $ 4,719 NM* Overhead costs 1,387 29 1,358 NM* Inventory costs related to EXONDYS 51 sold 414 26 388 NM* Other inventory costs 833 46 787 NM* Total cost of sales $ 7,353 $ 101 $ 7,252 NM* * NM: not meaningful The cost of sales for 2018 increased $26.8 million compared with 2017. The increase was primarily driven by the following: • $10.3 million increase in royalty payments to BioMarin primarily as a result of the increasing demand for EXONDYS 51 during 2018; • $8.2 million and $3.4 million increases in inventory costs related to EXONDYS 51 sold and overhead costs, respectively, reflect increasing demand for EXONDYS 51; and • $4.9 million increase in other inventory costs as a result of the write-off of certain batches of EXONDYS 51 not meeting our quality specifications. -66- The cost of sales for 2017 increased $7.3 million compared wi th 2016 . The increase was primarily driven by the following: • $4.7 million increase in royalty payments to BioMarin as a result of the execution of the settlement and license agreements with BioMarin in July 2017 as well as increasing demand for EXONDYS 51 during 2017; and • $1.4 million, $0.4 million and $0.8 million increases in overhead costs, inventory costs related to EXONDYS 51 sold, and other inventory costs, respectively, reflect increasing demand for EXONDYS 51. If product related costs had not previously been expensed as research and development expenses prior to receiving FDA approval, the incremental inventory costs related to EXONDYS 51 sold in 2018, 2017 and 2016 would have been approximately $12.6 million, $8.6 million and $0.5 million, respectively. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses consist of costs associated with research activities as well as costs associated with our product development efforts, conducting pre-clinical trials, clinical trials and manufacturing activities. Direct research and development expenses associated with our programs include clinical trial site costs, clinical manufacturing costs, costs incurred for consultants, up-front fees and milestones paid to third parties in connection with technologies that have not reached technological feasibility and do not have an alternative future use, and other external services, such as data management and statistical analysis support, and materials and supplies used in support of clinical programs. Indirect costs of our clinical programs include salaries, stock-based compensation and allocation of our facility costs. Research and development expenses represent a substantial percentage of our total operating expenses. We do not maintain or evaluate and, therefore, do not allocate internal research and development costs on a project-by-project basis. As a result, a significant portion of our research and development expenses are not tracked on a project-by-project basis, as the costs may benefit multiple projects.

The increase was primarily driven by the following: • $120.4 million increase in up-front and milestone payments, primarily consisting of (1) $85.0 million up-front and milestone payments to Myonexus as a result of the execution of a warrant agreement in May 2018 as well as certain development milestones being achieved or becoming probable of being achieved, (2) $44.8 million up-front and milestone payments to Lysogene as a result of the execution of a collaboration and license agreement in October 2018 as well as certain development milestones becoming probable of being achieved, and (3) $8.0 million related to the purchase of a license to develop, manufacture and commercialize a pre-clinical Pompe product candidate under a license agreement with Lacerta in August 2018, partially offset by a $22.0 million payment in the prior year to Summit as a result of achieving the milestone of the last patient being dosed in the safety arm cohort to the PhaseOut DMD study; • $35.4 million increase in clinical and manufacturing expenses primarily due to increased patient enrollment in our ongoing ESSENCE trial as well as a ramp-up of manufacturing activities for golodirsen, our gene therapy programs, and our PPMO platform. These increases were partially offset by a ramp-down of clinical trials in eteplirsen primarily because the PROMOVI trial has been fully enrolled; • $24.1 million and $7.6 million increases in compensation and other personnel expenses and facility-related expenses, respectively, primarily due to a net increase in headcount; • $13.6 million increase in pre-clinical expenses primarily due to the continuing ramp-up of toxicology studies in our PPMO platform; • $7.8 million increase in professional services primarily due to continuing accelerated company growth as a result of expansion of our research and development pipeline; • $5.7 million increase in stock-based compensation expense primarily driven by increases in headcount and stock price; -68- • $8.6 million increase in collaboration expense driven by collaboration cost sharing with Summit on its Utrophin platform ; and • $12.2 million increase in research and other, primarily consisting of (1) $4.0 million increase in sponsored research with institutions such as Duke University and Nationwide, (2) $3.8 million increase in loss due to impairment of certain patents, and (3) $2.9 million increase in lab supplies as a result increase in headcount. Research and development expenses for 2017 decreased by $21.6 million, or 11%, compared with 2016. The increase was primarily driven by the following: • $6.3 million decrease in clinical and manufacturing expenses primarily because of the capitalization of inventory following the approval of EXONDYS 51 by the FDA partially offset by increased patient enrollment in our on-going late stage clinical trials; • $26.0 million decrease in up-front and milestone payments. In 2017, we made a $22.0 million payment to Summit as a result of achieving the milestone of the last patient being dosed in the safety arm cohort to the PhaseOut DMD study. In 2016, we made $40.0 million and $7.0 million up-front payments to Summit and UWA, respectively, as a result of the execution of their respective license agreements; • $4.3 million increase in compensation and other personnel expenses as a result of an increase in headcount; • $2.6 million increase in professional fee due to accelerated company growth as a result of expansion of our research and development pipeline; • $6.0 million increase in pre-clinical expenses as a result of a ramp-up of toxicology studies in our PPMO platform and other follow-on exons; and • $1.8 million decrease in restructuring expenses as a majority of activities of the restructuring plans implemented in 2016 were completed prior to 2017. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and related costs for personnel in our executive, finance, legal, information technology, business development, human resources, commercial and other general and administrative functions. Other general and administrative expenses include an allocation of our facility costs and professional fees for legal, consulting and accounting services. -69- The following table summarizes our selling, general and administrative expenses by category for each of the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31 2018 2017 Change Change (in thousands) $ % Professional services $ 78,856 $ 44,652 $ 34,204 77 % Compensation and other personnel expenses 72,042 36,956 35,086 95 % Stock-based compensation 35,913 19,848 16,065 81 % Facility-related expenses 10,729 5,828 4,901 84 % Former CEO severance expense — 3,537 (3,537 ) (100 )% Restructuring expenses (2,222 ) 2,832 (5,054 ) (178 )% Other 12,443 9,029 3,414 38 % Total selling, general and administrative expenses $ 207,761 $ 122,682 $ 85,079 69 % For the Year Ended December 31 2017 2016 Change Change (in thousands) $ % Professional services $ 44,652 $ 19,372 $ 25,280 130 % Compensation and other personnel expenses 36,956 29,807 7,149 24 % Stock-based compensation 19,848 20,463 (615 ) (3 )% Facility-related expenses 5,828 4,669 1,159 25 % Former CEO severance expense 3,537 — 3,537 NM* Restructuring expenses 2,832 2,548 284 11 % Other 9,029 6,890 2,139 31 % Total selling, general and administrative expenses $ 122,682 $ 83,749 $ 38,933 46 % * NM: not meaningful Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2018 increased by $85.1 million, or 69%, compared with 2017. This was primarily driven by the following: • $34.2 million increase in professional services primarily due to continuing global expansion; • $35.1 million and $4.9 million increases in compensation and other personnel expenses and facility-related expenses, respectively, primarily due to an increase in headcount; • $16.1 million increase in stock-based compensation primarily due to increases in headcount and stock price, the achievement of a milestone related to the September 2016 restricted stock awards with performance conditions as well as the impact of revised forfeiture rate assumption for officers and members of our Board of Directors (beginning on January 1, 2018, based on recent trending of employee turnover data, we began to apply different forfeiture rates to non-officer employees and directors and officers); • $3.5 million decrease in severance expense as a result of the termination of our former CEO in June 2017; and • $5.1 million decrease in restructuring expenses primarily due to the relief of cease-use liabilities as a result of the termination of the rental agreement for our Corvallis facility. Selling, general and administrative expenses for 2017 increased by $38.9 million, or 46%, compared with 2016. This was primarily driven by the following: • $25.3 million increase in professional services driven by increased legal fees because of on-going litigations and global expansion; • $7.1 million and $1.2 million increases in compensation and other personnel expenses and facility-related expenses, respectively, primarily reflect an increase in headcount; and • $3.5 million increase in severance expense due to the resignation of our former CEO. -70- EXONDYS 51 Settlement and License Charges As a result of the execution of the settlement and license agreements with BioMarin in July 2017, we recognized EXONDYS 51 litigation and license charges of $28.4 million during 2017. Amortization of In-licensed Rights Amortization of in-license rights relate to the agreements we entered into with BioMarin and UWA in July 2017 and April 2011, respectively. We recorded an in-licensed right asset of approximately $6.6 million as a result of the settlement and license agreements with BioMarin. Additionally, following the first sale of EXONDYS 51 in September 2016, we recorded an in-licensed right asset of $1.0 million related to the license agreement with UWA. Both in-licensed rights are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the patent from the first commercial sale of EXONDYS 51. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recorded amortization of in-licensed rights of approximately $0.9 million, $1.1 million and less than $0.1 million, respectively. Interest expense and other, net Interest expense and other, net, primarily consists of interest income on our cash, cash equivalents and investments, interest expense and rental income and loss. Our cash equivalents and investments consist of money market funds, commercial paper, government and government agency debt securities and certificates of deposit. Interest expense includes interest accrued on our convertible notes, term loan, revolving line of credit and a mortgage loan related to our Corvallis, Oregon property. Rental income and loss is from leasing excess space in some of our facilities. Interest expense and other, net for 2018 increased by $17.0 million compared with 2017. Interest expense and other, net for 2017 increased by $1.5 million compared with 2016. For both 2018 and 2017, the increase was primarily driven by an increase in interest expense incurred in connection with the $570.0 million convertible debt offering partially offset by interest income from higher balances of cash, cash equivalents and investments. Gain from Sale of Priority Review Voucher In February 2017, we entered into an agreement with Gilead Sciences, Inc. (“Gilead”) to sell our Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher (“PRV”). We received the PRV when EXONDYS 51 was approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with DMD amenable to exon 51 skipping. Following the early termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, in March 2017, we completed our sale of the PRV to a subsidiary of Gilead. Pursuant to the agreement, the subsidiary of Gilead paid us $125.0 million, which was recorded as a gain from sale of the PRV as it did not have a carrying value at the time of the sale. Income tax (benefit) expense Income tax benefit for 2018 was approximately $0.7 million, which primarily reflected adjustments to estimated state income taxes in 2017. Income tax expense for 2017 was approximately $2.1 million, which related to the alternative minimum tax related to the gain from the sale of the PRV and estimated state income taxes. There was no income tax expense in 2016. -71- Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table summarizes our financial condition for each of the periods indicated: As of December 31, 2018 As of December 31, 2017 Change Change (in thousands) $ % Financial assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 370,829 $ 599,691 $ (228,862 ) (38 )% Short-term investments 803,083 479,369 323,714 68 % Long-term investments — 9,980 (9,980 ) (100 )% Restricted cash and investments 1,001 784 217 28 % Total cash, cash equivalents and investments $ 1,174,913 $ 1,089,824 $ 85,089 8 % Borrowings: Long-term debt $ — $ 30,410 $ (30,410 ) (100 )% Convertible debt 420,554 400,641 19,913 5 % Total borrowings $ 420,554 $ 431,051 $ (10,497 ) (2 )% Working capital Current assets $ 1,426,183 $ 1,228,644 $ 197,539 16 % Current liabilities 173,690 88,332 85,358 97 % Total working capital $ 1,252,493 $ 1,140,312 $ 112,181 10 % For the year ended December 31, 2018, our principal source of liquidity was from debt and equity financings and product sales from EXONDYS 51. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our principal source of liquidity was from debt and equity financings, sale of the PRV and product sales from EXONDYS 51. Our principal uses of cash are research and development expenses, selling, general and administrative expenses, investments, capital expenditures, business development transactions and other working capital requirements. Our future expenditures and capital requirements may be substantial and will depend on many factors, including but not limited to the following: • our ability to continue to generate revenues from sales of EXONDYS 51 and potential future products; • the timing and costs associated with our global expansion; • the timing and costs of building out our manufacturing capabilities; • the timing of advanced payments related to our future inventory commitments and manufacturing obligations; • the timing and costs associated with our clinical trials and pre-clinical trials; • the attainment of milestones and our obligations to make milestone payments to Myonexus, BioMarin, Lysogene, Lacerta, Nationwide, UWA and other institutions; • repayment of outstanding debt; and • the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and our other intellectual property rights. Our cash requirements are expected to continue to increase as we advance our research, development and commercialization programs and we expect to seek additional financings primarily from, but not limited to, the sale and issuance of equity and debt securities, the licensing or sale of our technologies or additional government contracts. We cannot provide assurances that financing will be available when and as needed or that, if available, the financings will be on favorable or acceptable terms. If we are unable to obtain additional financing when and if we require, this would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. To the extent we issue additional equity securities, our existing stockholders could experience substantial dilution. -72- Cash Flows The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for each of the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31 2018 2017 Change Change (in thousands) $ % Cash provided by (used in) Operating activities $ (388,660 ) $ (231,996 ) $ (156,664 ) 68 % Investing activities (370,488 ) (178,815 ) (191,673 ) 107 % Financing activities 530,150 888,082 (357,932 ) (40 )% (Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (228,998 ) $ 477,271 $ (706,269 ) (148 )% For the Year Ended December 31 2017 2016 Change Change (in thousands) $ % Cash provided by (used in) Operating activities $ (231,996 ) $ (245,820 ) $ 13,824 (6 )% Investing activities (178,815 ) (90,193 ) (88,622 ) 98 % Financing activities 888,082 378,129 509,953 135 % Increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 477,271 $ 42,116 $ 435,155 NM* * NM: not meaningful Operating Activities. Cash used in operating activities increased by $156.7 million for 2018 compared with 2017, primarily due to the following: • $186.2 million increase in net loss (excluding the gain from sale of PRV in 2017) primarily driven by increases in research and development expense and selling, general and administrative expense partially offset by an increase in net product revenues for EXONDYS 51; and • $10.4 million increase in unfavorable change in operating assets and liabilities. The increases were partially offset by: • $37.7 million increase in non-cash adjustments. Cash used in operating activities decreased by $13.8 million for 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to the following: • $91.6 million decrease in net loss (excluding the gain from sale of PRV) which was driven by net product revenues for EXONDYS 51 and decreased research and development expenses primarily due to capitalization of inventory following the approval of EXONDYS 51 partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses; and • $3.9 million increase in non-cash adjustments. The increases were partially offset by: • unfavorable changes of $81.7 million in operating assets and liabilities primarily related to increases in accounts receivables and inventory as we launched EXONDYS 51. Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities increased by $191.7 million for 2018 compared with 2017, primarily due to the following: • $582.1 million increase in purchase of available-for-sale securities; • $49.2 million increase in purchase of property and equipment; • $125.0 million decrease in proceeds from sales of the PRV; and • $10.7 million decrease in proceeds from maturity of a restricted investment. -73- The increases were partially offset by : • $569.6 million increase in proceeds from maturity of available-for-sale securities; and • $6.0 million decrease in purchase of intangible assets. Cash used in investing activities increased by $88.6 million for 2017 compared with 2016, primarily due to the following: • $394.1 million increase in purchase of available-for-sale securities; • $6.7 million increase in purchase of property and equipment; and • $7.7 million increase in purchase of intangible assets. The increases were partially offset by: • $184.1 million increase in proceeds from maturity of available-for-sale securities; • $125.0 million from sales of the PRV; • $10.7 million increase in proceeds from maturity of a restricted investment. Financing Activities. Cash provided by financing activities decreased by $357.9 million for 2018 compared with 2017, primarily driven by the following: • $388.7 million decrease in proceeds from debt financings; and • $214.6 million increase in repayment of outstanding debts. The decreases were partially offset by: • $159.5 million increase in proceeds from sales of common stock; • $50.9 million decrease in purchase of capped call options; and • $35.0 million increase in proceeds from the exercise of options and our employee stock purchase program. Cash provided by financing activities increased by $510.0 million for 2017 compared with 2016, primarily driven by the following: • $624.6 million increase in proceeds from debt financings. The increase was partially offset by: • $50.9 million increase in purchase of capped call options; • $47.2 million increase in repayment of outstanding debts; • $10.8 million decrease in proceeds from sales of common stock; and • $5.7 million decrease in proceeds from the exercise of options and our employee stock purchase program. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements During the periods presented, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or for another contractually narrow or limited purpose. -74- Contractual Payment Obligations In our continuing operations, we have entered into long-term contractual arrangements from time to time for our facilities, the provision of goods and services, and issuance of debt securities, among others. The following table presents contractual obligations arising from these arrangements as of December 31, 2018: Payment Due by Period Total Less Than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3 - 5 Years More than 5 Years (in thousands) Convertible debt (1) $ 620,231 $ 8,550 $ 17,100 $ 17,100 $ 577,481 Lease obligations 77,720 11,588 23,953 21,655 20,524 Manufacturing obligations (2) 458,352 182,352 68,000 84,000 124,000 Total contractual obligations and contingencies $ 1,156,303 $ 202,490 $ 109,053 $ 122,755 $ 722,005 (1) Interest is included. (2) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding or subject to cancellation fees and that specify all significant terms. Purchase obligations relate primarily to our commercialization of EXONDYS 51 and clinical programs for DMD and gene therapy programs. Milestone Obligations For product candidates that are currently in various research and development stages, we may be obligated to make up to $378.8 million of future development, up-front royalty and sales milestone payments associated with our collaboration and license agreements. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable upon achievement of certain development, regulatory or sales milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones is not probable and payment is not required as of December 31, 2018, such contingencies have not been recorded in our consolidated financial statements. Amounts related to contingent milestone payments are not yet considered contractual obligations as they are contingent on the successful achievement of certain development, regulatory approval and sales milestones. Other Funding Commitments We have several on-going clinical trials in various stages. Our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to CROs. The CRO contracts are generally cancellable at our option. As of December 31, 2018, we have approximately $71.6 million in cancellable future commitments based on existing CRO contracts. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Please read Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Our current investment policy is to maintain a diversified investment portfolio consisting of money market investments, commercial paper, government and government agency bonds and high-grade corporate bonds with maturities of 36 months or less. Our cash is deposited in and invested through highly rated financial institutions in North America. As of December 31, 2018, we had $1,174.9 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments, comprised of $370.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, $803.1 million short-term investments and $1.0 million of restricted investment. The Company only holds debt securities classified as available-for-sale. The fair value of cash equivalents and short-term investments is subject to change as a result of potential changes in market interest rates. The potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments has been assessed on a hypothetical 10 basis point adverse movement across all maturities. For each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we estimate that such hypothetical adverse 10 basis point movement would result in a hypothetical loss in fair value of approximately $0.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively, to our interest rate sensitive instruments. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. The information required by this Item 8 begins on page F-1 in Item 15 of Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is incorporated into this item by reference. -75- Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. Disclosure Controls and Procedures We carried out an evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to paragraph (b) of Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Based on that review, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act (1) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and (2) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control procedure, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control procedure are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. We considered these limitations during the development of our disclosure controls and procedures, and will continually reevaluate them to ensure they provide reasonable assurance that such controls and procedures are effective. Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for our Company, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that: • pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; • provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and • provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in its 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on this assessment, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2018, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have not been material changes in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a–15(f) and 15d–15(f) under the Exchange Act for the quarter ended December 31, 2018 that our certifying officers concluded materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. -76- Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc.: Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. and subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 28, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2018, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 28, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. (signed) KPMG LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002.

F-6 Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (together with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, “Sarepta” or the “Company”) is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of unique RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene therapy and other genetic medicine approaches for the treatment of rare diseases. Applying its proprietary, highly-differentiated and innovative platform technologies, the Company is able to target a broad range of diseases and disorders. Its first commercial product in the U.S., EXONDYS 51 ® (eteplirsen) Injection (“EXONDYS 51”), was granted accelerated approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) on September 19, 2016. EXONDYS 51 is indicated for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (“DMD”) in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 51 skipping. In December 2018, the Company completed the submission of its rolling new drug application (“NDA”) to the FDA seeking accelerated approval for golodirsen, the Company’s PMO chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 53 of the DMD gene. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately $1,174.9 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments, consisting of $370.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, $803.1 million of short-term investments, and $1.0 million of a long-term restricted investment. The Company believes that its balance of cash, cash equivalents and investments as of December 31, 2018 is sufficient to fund its current operational plan for at least the next twelve months, though it may pursue additional cash resources through public or private debt and equity financings, seek additional government contracts and establish collaborations with or license its technology to other companies. 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”), reflect the accounts of Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions between and among its consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated. Management has determined that the Company operates in one segment: helping patients through the discovery and development of unique RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene therapy and other genetic therapeutic modalities for the treatment of rare diseases . The Company’s CEO, as the chief operating decision-maker, manages and allocates resources to the operations of the Company on a total company basis. The Company’s research and development organization is responsible for the research and discovery of new product candidates and supports development and registration efforts for potential future products. The Company’s supply chain organization manages the development of the manufacturing processes, clinical trial supply and commercial product supply. The Company’s commercial organization is responsible for commercialization of EXONDYS 51 in the U.S. and internationally. The Company is supported by other back-office general and administration functions. Consistent with this decision-making process, the Company’s CEO uses consolidated, single-segment financial information for purposes of evaluating performance, forecasting future period financial results, allocating resources and setting incentive targets. Estimates and Uncertainties The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Fair Value Measurements The Company has certain financial assets that are recorded at fair value which have been classified as Level 1, 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy as described in the accounting standards for fair value measurements: • Level 1—quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; • Level 2—quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and • Level 3—valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant value drivers are unobservable. F-7 The fair value of the majority of the Company’s financial assets is categorized as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. These assets include money market funds, publicly traded debt, and equity securities. For additional information related to fair value measurements, please read Note 5, Fair Value Measurements to the consolidated financial statements. Cash and Cash Equivalents Only investments that are highly liquid and readily convertible to cash and have original maturities of three months or less are considered cash equivalents. Investments Available-For-Sale Debt Securities Available-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair market value and unrealized gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholder’s equity. Realized gains and losses are reported in interest expense and other, net, on a specific identification basis. Equity Investments The Company’s equity investments include its investments in a publicly traded biotechnology company and a privately held biotechnology company and are included in investments and other assets in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The equity investment in the publicly traded biotechnology company has a readily determinable fair value and is carried at fair value with changes in value recorded in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The equity investment in the privately held biotechnology company does not have readily determinable fair value and is measured at cost less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer, which is recorded as a gain or loss on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Accounts Receivable The Company’s accounts receivable arise from product sales, government research contracts and other grants. They are generally stated at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Revenues from product sales are recorded at the net sales price (transaction price), which includes estimates of variable consideration for which reserves are established and which result from Medicaid rebates, governmental chargebacks including Public Health Services (“PHS”) chargebacks, prompt pay discounts, co-pay assistance and distribution fees. These reserves are based on the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if no payments are required of the Company) for PHS chargebacks, prompt pay discounts and certain distribution fees, or a current liability (if a payment is required of us), for Medicaid rebates, co-pay assistance and certain distribution fees. The accounts receivable from product sales represents receivables due from the Company’s specialty distributor and specialty pharmacies in the U.S. as well as certain distributors in the EU, Brazil, Israel and the Middle East (collectively, “Customers”). The Company monitors the financial performance and creditworthiness of its Customers so that it can properly assess and respond to changes in the Customers’ credit profiles. The Company provides reserves against trade receivables for estimated losses that may result from a customer’s inability to pay. Amounts determined to be uncollectible are written-off against the established reserve. As of December 31, 2018, the credit profiles for the Company’s Customers are deemed to be in good standing and an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is not considered necessary. Further, no accounts receivable amounts related to government research contracts and other grants have historically been written off and, thus, an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable related to government research contracts and other grants is also not considered necessary. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of accounts receivable from Customers and cash, cash equivalent and investments held at financial institutions. For the year ended December 31, 2018 , the majority of the Company’s accounts receivable arose from product sales in the U.S. and all customers have standard payment terms which generally require payment within 30 to 60 days. Outside of the U.S., the payment terms range between 60 and 120 days. Three individual customers accounted for 42%, 38% and 18% of net product revenues and 51%, 28% and 10% of accounts receivable from product sales, respectively. As of December 31, 2018 , the Company believes that such Customers are of high credit quality. F-8 As of December 31, 2018 , the Company’s cash equivalents and investments were concentrated at three financial institution s. T he Company does not believe that there is significant risk of non-performance by the financial institution s . Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. The Company capitalizes inventory costs associated with products following regulatory approval when future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized. EXONDYS 51 inventory that may be used in clinical development programs is charged to research and development expense when the product enters the research and development process and no longer can be used for commercial purposes. The Company periodically reviews its inventories for excess amounts or obsolescence and writes down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value. Additionally, though the Company’s product is subject to strict quality control and monitoring which it performs throughout the manufacturing processes, certain batches or units of product may not meet quality specifications resulting in a charge to cost of sales. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are initially recorded at cost, including the acquisition cost and all costs necessarily incurred to bring the asset to the location and working condition necessary for its intended use. The cost of normal, recurring or periodic repairs and maintenance activities related to property and equipment are expensed as incurred. The cost for planned major maintenance activities, including the related acquisition or construction of assets, is capitalized if the repair will result in future economic benefits. Interest costs incurred during the construction period of major capital projects are capitalized until the asset is ready for its intended use, at which point the interest costs are amortized as depreciation expense over the life of the underlying asset. The Company generally depreciates the cost of its property and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which are summarized as follows: Asset Category Useful lives Lab equipment 5 years Office equipment 5 years Software and computer equipment 3 - 5 years Leasehold improvements Lesser of the useful life or the term of the respective lease Land Not depreciated Building 30 years Construction in Progress Not depreciated until put into service Intangible assets The Company’s intangible assets consist of in-licensed rights, patent costs, and software licenses, which are stated in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets net of accumulated amortization and impairments, if applicable. The in-licensed rights relates to agreements with BioMarin (defined in Note 3) and the University of Western Australia (“UWA”). The in-licensed rights are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the related patent because the life of the related patent reflects the expected time period that the Company will benefit from the in-licensed rights. Patent costs consist primarily of external legal costs, filing fees incurred to file patent applications and renewal fees on proprietary technology developed or licensed by the Company. Patent costs associated with applying for a patent, being issued a patent and annual renewal fees are capitalized. Costs to defend a patent and costs to invalidate a competitor’s patent or patent application are expensed as incurred. Patent costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated economic lives or the initial term of the patents, which is generally 20 years. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets held and used by the Company, intangible assets with definite lives and equity investments without a readily determinable fair value are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. The Company evaluates recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset. If the asset is considered to be impaired, the impairment F-9 to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Such reviews assess the fair value of the assets based upon estimates of future cash flows that the assets are expected to generate. Convertible Debt The Company separately accounts for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments that can be settled in cash by allocating the proceeds from issuance between the liability component and the embedded conversion option. The value of the equity component is calculated by first measuring the fair value of the liability component, using the interest rate of a similar liability that does not have a conversion feature, as of the issuance date. The difference between the proceeds from the convertible debt issuance and the amount measured as the liability component is recorded as the equity component with a corresponding discount recorded on the debt. The Company recognizes the amortization of the resulting discount as interest expense using the effective interest method. Simultaneously, the Company bought capped call options from certain counterparties to minimize the impact of potential dilution upon conversion. The premium for the capped call options was recorded as additional paid-in capital. For additional information related to the convertible debt transactions, please read Note 14, Indebtedness to the consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for the goods or services provided. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements within the scope of ASC Topic 606 , “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”, the Company performs the following five steps: (1) identify the contracts with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation. The Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers or provides to the customer. At contract inception, the Company assesses the goods or services promised within each contract and determines those that are performance obligations, and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. The Company then recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when or as the performance obligation is satisfied. For all contracts that fall into the scope of ASC Topic 606, only one performance obligation has been identified by the Company: to timely deliver drug products to the customer’s designated warehouses. Product revenues The Company distributes its product principally through its Customers. The Customers subsequently resell the product to patients and health care providers. The Company provides no right of return to the Customers except in cases of shipping error or product defect. Product revenues are recognized when the Customers take control of the product, which typically occurs upon delivery to the Customers. For the years ended 2018, 2017 and 2016, the majority of the revenues recognized were generated by the specialty distributor and specialty pharmacies in the U.S. Variable Consideration Product revenues are recorded at the net sales price (transaction price) which includes estimated reserves for variable consideration, such as Medicaid rebates, governmental chargebacks, including PHS chargebacks, prompt payment discounts, co-pay assistance and distribution fees. These reserves reflect the Company’s best estimates of the amount of consideration to which it is entitled based on the terms of the contracts. Additional details relating to variable consideration follows: • Medicaid rebates relate to the Company’s estimated obligations to states under established reimbursement arrangements. Medicaid rebate reserves are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a liability which is included in accrued expenses. • Governmental chargebacks, including PHS chargebacks, relate to the Company’s estimated obligations resulting from contractual commitments to sell products to qualified healthcare providers at prices lower than the list prices that the Company charges to wholesalers. The wholesaler charges the Company for the difference between what the wholesaler pays for the products and the ultimate selling price to the qualified healthcare providers. Chargeback reserves are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and accounts receivable. Chargeback amounts are generally determined at the time of resale to the qualified healthcare provider from the wholesaler, and the Company generally issues credits for such amounts within a few weeks of receiving notification of resale from the wholesaler. • Prompt payment discounts relate to the Company’s estimated obligations for credits to be granted to a specialty pharmacy for remitting payment on its purchases within established incentive periods. Reserves for prompt payment discounts are F-10 recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and accounts receivable. • Co-pay assistance relates to financial assistance provided to qualified patients, whereby the Company may assist them with prescription drug co-payments required by the patient’s insurance provider. Reserves for co-pay assistance are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and the establishment of a liability which is included in accrued expenses. • Distribution fees relate to fees paid to Customers in the distribution channel that provide the Company with inventory management, data and distribution services and are generally accounted for as a reduction of revenue. To the extent that the services received are distinct from the Company’s sale of products to the Customers, these payments are accounted for as selling, general and administrative expenses. Reserves for distribution fees result in an increase in a liability if payments are required of the Company or a reduction of accounts receivable if no payments are required of the Company. Deferred revenue As of December 31, 2018, the Company had deferred revenue of $3.3 million, which primarily represents up-front fees which it may recognize as revenue upon settlement of certain contingencies related to an agreement with Charley’s Fund, Inc. Research and Development Research and development expenses consist of costs associated with research activities as well as those with the Company’s product development efforts, conducting pre-clinical trials, clinical trials and manufacturing activities. Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred. Up-front fees and milestones paid to third parties in connection with technologies which have not reached technological feasibility and do not have an alternative future use are expensed when incurred. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities pursuant to an executory contractual arrangement will be capitalized, and recognized as an expense as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed. If the Company does not expect the goods to be delivered or services to be rendered, the advance payment capitalized will be charged to expense. Direct research and development expenses associated with the Company’s programs include clinical trial site costs, clinical manufacturing costs, costs incurred for consultants and other external services, such as data management and statistical analysis support and materials and supplies used in support of clinical programs. Indirect costs of the Company’s clinical programs include salaries, stock-based compensation and an allocation of its facility costs. When third-party service providers’ billing terms do not coincide with the Company’s period-end, the Company is required to make estimates of its obligations to those third parties, including clinical trial and pharmaceutical development costs, contractual services costs and costs for supply of its drug candidates, incurred in a given accounting period and record accruals at the end of the period. The Company bases its estimates on its knowledge of the research and development programs, services performed for the period, past history for related activities and the expected duration of the third-party service contract, where applicable. Stock-Based Compensation The Company’s stock-based compensation programs include stock options, restricted stock awards (“RSAs”), restricted stock units (“RSUs”), stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) and an employee stock purchase program (“ESPP”). The Company accounts for stock-based compensation using the fair value method. The fair values of stock options and SARs are estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The fair values of RSAs and RSUs are based on the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant. The fair value of stock awards, with consideration given to estimated forfeitures, is recognized as stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the grants. For stock awards with performance-vesting conditions, the Company does not recognize compensation expense until it is probable that the performance-vesting condition will be achieved. Under the Company’s ESPP, participating employees purchase common stock through payroll deductions. The purchase price is equal to 85% of the lower of the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the first business day and the last business day of the relevant purchase period. The fair values of stock purchase rights are estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The fair value of the look-back provision with the 15% discount is recognized on a graded-vesting basis as stock-based compensation expense over the purchase period. F-11 In addition to stock options with service and performance conditions, the Company also granted its CEO options with service and market conditions. A market condition relates to the achievement of a specified price of the Company’s common stock, a specified amount of intrinsic value indexed to the Company’s common stock or a specified price of the Company’s common stock in terms of other similar equity shares. The grant date fair value for the options with service and market conditions is determined by a lattice model with Monte Carlo simulations and is recognized as stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period. Income Taxes The Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. It is the intention of the Company to reinvest the earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries in those operations and not to repatriate the earnings to the U.S. Accordingly, the Company does not provide for deferred taxes on the excess of the financial reporting over the tax basis in its investments in foreign subsidiaries as they are considered permanent in duration. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered and settled. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the net deferred tax asset to zero when it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon an examination. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The TCJA reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. The Company continues to evaluate the overall impact of the TCJA on its business. There is continuing uncertainty in the TCJA, and although changes or challenges cannot be predicted, the Company believes it has used reasonable assumptions and interpretations in applying the TCJA. The Company continues to monitor for legislative developments, issuance of regulations and technical memorandum to provide further clarification and/or interpretations of the TCJA and will adjust its financial statements as needed . Rent Expense The Company’s operating leases for its Cambridge, Andover and Burlington, Massachusetts and Dublin and Columbus, Ohio facilities provide for scheduled annual rent increases throughout each lease’s term. The Company recognizes the effects of the scheduled rent increases on a straight-line basis over the full term of the leases. Tenant improvement allowances provided by a landlord are recorded as deferred rent and amortized as reduction to rent expense over the lease term. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company recognized rent expense and occupancy costs of $7.9 million, $4.4 million and $5.6 million, respectively. Commitments and Contingencies The Company records liabilities for legal and other contingencies when information available to the Company indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Legal costs in connection with legal and other contingencies are expensed as costs are incurred. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2016-02, “ Leases (Topic 842) ”, which supersedes ASC Topic 840, “ Leases ”, and issued additional clarifications throughout 2018. Under the new guidance, a lessee should recognize assets and liabilities that arise from its leases and disclose qualitative and quantitative information about its leasing arrangements. The Company expects to elect the optional transition method to apply the standard as of the January 1, 2019 the effective date and therefore, it will not apply the standard to comparative periods. The Company also expects to elect the available package of practical expedients in transition which would allow it to not re-assess whether existing or expired arrangements contain a lease, the lease classification of existing or expired leases, or whether previous initial direct costs would qualify for capitalization under the new lease standard. The Company continues to finalize the impact of the ASU on its processes, disclosures and internal controls over financial reporting. Based on the procedures performed to date, the Company has estimated that the adoption of this ASU will result in an increase between $40.0 million and $45.0 million in right of use assets and between $60.0 million and $65.0 million in lease liabilities. F-12 In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-08, “ Receivables - Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Subtopic 310-20): Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities ”. This new standard amends the amortization period for certain purchased callable debt securities held at a premium by shortening the amortization period for the premium to the earliest call date. ASU No. 2017-02 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. As of December 31, 2018 , the Company has elected to early adopt this new standard and the adoption did not have a material impact on its financial position and results of operations. In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-07, “ Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718), Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting .” This ASU expands the scope of Topic 718 to include share based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees. An entity should apply the requirements of Topic 718 to nonemployee awards except for specific guidance on inputs to an option pricing model and the attribution of cost. ASU No. 2018-07 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted, although no earlier than the adoption date of Topic 606. The Company elected to early adopt this ASU in the quarter ended June 30, 2018 and determined that the adoption of this new standard did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820), Disclosure Framework – Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement”. This ASU removed the following disclosure requirements: (1) the amount of and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy; (2) the policy for timing of transfers between levels; and (3) the valuation processes for Level 3 fair value measurements. Additionally, this update added the following disclosure requirements: (1) the changes in unrealized gains and losses for the period included in other comprehensive income and loss for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements held at the end of the reporting period; (2) the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements. For certain unobservable inputs, an entity may disclose other quantitative information (such as the median or arithmetic average) in lieu of the weighted average if the entity determines that other quantitative information would be a more reasonable and rational method to reflect the distribution of unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements. ASU No. 2018-13 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 with early adoption permitted. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has not elected to early adopt this guidance but does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, “ Intangibles – Goodwill and Other – Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That is a Service Contract”. This ASU requires a customer in a cloud computing arrangement (i.e., hosting arrangement) that is a service contract to follow the internal-use software guidance contained in ASC Subtopic 350-40 to determine which implementation costs to capitalize as assets or expense as incurred. Capitalized implementation costs related to a hosting arrangement that is a service contract will be amortized over the term of the hosting arrangement, beginning when the module or component of the hosting arrange is ready for its intended use. ASU No. 2018-15 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has not elected to early adopt this guidance but believes that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. 3. LICENSE AND COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS Lysogene S.A. On October 15, 2018, the Company entered into a license and collaboration agreement (the “Lysogene License and Collaboration Agreement”) for developing and commercializing LYS-SAF302, a gene therapy to treat Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA (“MPS IIIA”) with Lysogene S.A. (“Lysogene”). Under the terms of the Lysogene License and Collaboration Agreement, Lysogene will be responsible for completion of the pivotal trial, which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2018. The Company will have exclusive rights to commercialize LYS-SAF302 in the U.S. and all territories outside of Europe. Lysogene will retain exclusive commercial rights to LYS-SAF302 in Europe. The Company will be responsible for global manufacturing of LYS-SAF302 and will supply drug products to Lysogene for Europe. Lysogene also granted the Company certain option rights to an additional central nervous system targeted gene therapy candidate. Concurrently with the execution of the Lysogene License and Collaboration Agreement, the Company entered into an equity investment agreement with Lysogene. Under the equity investment agreement, the Company purchased 950,606 shares of common stock issued by Lysogene, representing 8% of the outstanding equity of Lysogene at the time of the transaction. The Company considered whether it would have to consolidate the operations of Lysogene and concluded that, while Lysogene is a variable interest entity, the Company is not the primary beneficiary as it does not have the power to direct the activities that would most significantly impact the economic performance of Lysogene. F-13 As a result of execution of the agreements, the Company made a payment of $28.0 million to Lysogene related to the up-front license fee, the option fee, the equity investment and reimbursement of certain development activities. Additionally, the Company may be liable for up to approximately $102.8 million in development, regulatory and sales milestones associated with the Lysogene License and Collaboration Agreement. Furthermore, the Company may be required to make tiered royalty payments based on net sales of the LYS-SAF302 product subsequent to its commercialization. Of the $28.0 million payment to Lysogene, $1.9 million was allocated to the equity investment in Lysogene, based on the closing price of Lysogene’s common stock traded on the Euronext Paris Exchange on October 12, 2018, and was recorded as an other non-current asset. The remaining $26.1 million was allocated to the up-front license fee, the option fee, and reimbursement of certain development activities, and represents rights to potential future benefits associated with ongoing research and development activities that have no alternative future use. Accordingly, this amount was recorded as research and development expense as incurred. As of December 31, 2018, one development milestone was deemed as probable of being achieved. As a result, the Company recorded an accrued expense of $18.7 million which was classified as research and development expense. Changes in the fair value of the equity investment in Lysogene are recorded to other income and expense in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive loss. As of December 31, 2018, the Company recognized a loss of $0.2 million related to the change in fair market value of the equity investment. Lacerta Therapeutics On August 8, 2018 (the “Effective Date”), the Company entered into a License, Development and Option Agreement (the “Lacerta License Agreement”) with Lacerta Therapeutics, Inc. (“Lacerta”). Pursuant to the Lacerta License Agreement, the Company licensed exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize a pre-clinical Pompe product candidate (the “Pompe License”). Lacerta also granted the Company exclusive options to enter into exclusive license agreements to develop, manufacture and commercialize other gene therapy product candidates for Sanfilipo syndrome and L-Amino Acid Decarboxylase Deficiency for additional consideration of $42.0 million (collectively, the “Options”) when (and if) the Options are exercised. Additionally, the Company may be liable for up to approximately $44.0 million in development, regulatory and sales milestones associated with the Pompe License and may be required to make a high-single-digit royalty payments based on net sales of the Pompe product subsequent to its commercialization. Concurrently with the execution of the Lacerta License Agreement, the Company entered into a Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Lacerta. Under the Purchase Agreement, the Company purchased approximately 4.5 million shares of Series A preferred stock issued by Lacerta. The Company considered whether it would have to consolidate the operations of Lacerta and concluded that, while Lacerta is a variable interest entity, the Company is not the primary beneficiary as it does not have the power to direct the activities that would most significantly impact the economic performance of Lacerta. The Company made an up-front payment of $38.0 million to Lacerta in consideration of both the Lacerta License Agreement and the Purchase Agreement. This payment was allocated to the fair value of the Series A preferred stock investment, the Pompe License and the Options based on their respective relative fair values on the Effective Date. The fair value of the Options were determined using an option pricing model, whereas the Series A preferred stock investment was determined using a cost approach corroborated by the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of the Pompe License was determined by the income approach, using a discounted cash flow model based on projections of future cash flows that will arise from the Pompe product candidate. Accordingly: (i) $30.0 million was allocated to the Series A preferred stock investment, (ii) $8.0 million was allocated to the Pompe License, and (iii) no amount was allocated to the Options as they are far out of money and were determined to have a fair value of zero. The Series A preferred stock investment was initially measured at cost and classified as an other non-current asset in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Subsequently, changes in the carrying value of the investment will be reported as a component of earnings whenever there are observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of Lacerta in the future. The amount allocated to the Pompe License represents rights to potential future benefits associated with ongoing research and development activities that have no alternative future use. Accordingly, this amount has been recorded as research and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, no development milestones were deemed as probable of being achieved and, accordingly, no research and development expense was recognized related to these development milestones. Myonexus Therapeutics On May 3, 2018, the Company entered into a Warrant to Purchase Common Stock Agreement (“Warrant Agreement”) with Myonexus Therapeutics, Inc. (“Myonexus”). Pursuant to the terms of the Warrant Agreement, the Company made an up-front payment of $60.0 million to purchase an exclusive option to acquire Myonexus for $200.0 million plus sales-related and regulatory- F-14 related contingent payments. Prior to the exercise of the option to acquire Myonexus, the Company may be required to make additional development milestone payments to Myonexus of up to $45.0 million over an approximately two-year evaluation period. The Company considered whether it would have to consolidate the operations of Myonexus and concluded that, while Myonexus is a variable interest entity, the Company is not the primary beneficiary as it does not have the power to direct the activities that would most significantly impact the economic performance of Myonexus. As of December 31, 2018, the Company made an up-front payment of $60.0 million and milestone payments totaling $20.0 million to Myonexus corresponding to execution of the Warrant Agreement and achievement of two development milestones, respectively. Additionally, the third development milestone for $5.0 million was deemed probable of being achieved as of December 31, 2018, and has been recorded as an accrued expense. Prior to regulatory approval, all consideration paid to Myonexus represents rights to potential future benefits associated with Myonexus’s ongoing research and development activities, which have not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use. Accordingly, the Company recorded $85.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as research and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Nationwide Children’s Hospital On December 29, 2016, the Company entered into an exclusive option agreement with Nationwide Children’s Hospital (“Nationwide”) from which the Company obtained an exclusive right to acquire a worldwide license of the micro-dystrophin gene therapy technology for DMD and Becker muscular dystrophy. On October 8, 2018, the Company exercised the option and entered into a license agreement with Nationwide (“Nationwide License Agreement”). Pursuant to the Nationwide License Agreement, the Company licensed exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize micro-dystrophin gene therapy product candidates. Under the agreement, the Company made an up-front payment of $1.0 million to Nationwide, which was recorded as research and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2018. Additionally, the Company may be required to make up to $29.0 million in development, regulatory and sale milestone payments per micro-dystrophin product and a low-single-digit royalty payments based on net sales of the micro-dystrophin products upon commercialization. As of December 31, 2018, no development milestones were deemed as probable of being achieved and, accordingly, no research and development expense was recognized related to these development milestones. BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. In July 2017, the Company and UWA entered into a settlement agreement with BioMarin Leiden Holding BV, its subsidiaries BioMarin Nederlands BV and BioMarin Technologies BV (collectively, “BioMarin”). On the same day, the Company entered into a license agreement with BioMarin and Academisch Ziekenhuis Leiden (“AZL”) (collectively with the Company, UWA and BioMarin, the “Settlement Parties”). Under these agreements, BioMarin agreed to provide the Company with an exclusive license to certain intellectual property with an option to convert the exclusive license into a co-exclusive license and the Settlement Parties agreed to stop most existing efforts to continue with ongoing litigation and opposition and other administrative proceedings concerning BioMarin’s intellectual property. Under terms of the agreements, the Company agreed to make total up-front payments of $35.0 million upon execution of the agreements, consisting of $20.0 million under the settlement agreement and $15.0 million under the license agreement. Additionally, the Company may be liable for up to approximately $65.0 million in regulatory and sales milestones for eteplirsen as well as exon 45 and exon 53 skipping product candidates. BioMarin will also be eligible to receive royalty payments, ranging from 4% - 8%, for exon 51 skipping products, exon 45 skipping products and exon 53 skipping products. The royalty terms under the license agreement will expire in December 2023 in the U.S. and September 2024 in the EU. In connection with the above agreements, in July 2017, the Company made a cash payment of $35.0 million to BioMarin. Of this amount, $6.6 million was recorded as an intangible asset on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The remaining amount of $28.4 million was expensed as incurred as EXONDYS 51 settlement and license charges in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The $6.6 million intangible asset represents the fair value of the U.S. license to BioMarin’s intellectual property related to EXONDYS 51, which was determined by an income-based approach, and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the patent. For the year ended December 31, 2018 , the Company recognized intangible asset amortization expense and royalty expense of approximately $0.9 million and $15.1 million, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized intangible asset amortization expense and royalty expense of approximately $1.0 million and $4.7 million, respectively. The royalties are included in cost of sales in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. As of December 31, 2018, no regulatory or sales milestones were deemed as probable of being achieved and, accordingly, no additional in-licensed rights were recognized related to these milestones. F-15 Summit (Oxford) Ltd. In October 2016, the Company entered into an exclusive Collaboration and License Agreement (the “Summit Collaboration Agreement”) with Summit which grants the Company the exclusive right to commercialize products in Summit’s utrophin modulator pipeline in the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Turkey and the Commonwealth of Independent States (the “Licensed Territory”). Under the terms of the Summit Collaboration Agreement, the Company made an up-front payment of $40.0 million to Summit, with additional payments of up to $192.0 million based on achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones for ezutromid, a Summit product candidate in its utrophin modulator pipeline. For each of Summit’s future generation small molecule utrophin modulators, the Company may be required to make up to $290.0 million in development and regulatory milestone payments. Additionally, on a product-by-product basis, the Company may be required to make up to $330.0 million in sales milestone payments. The Summit Collaboration Agreement also grants the Company an option to expand the Licensed Territory (“Option Territory”). If the Company exercises this option, it will be liable for a one-time $10.0 million option fee as well as up to $7.0 million in regulatory milestone payments. For each licensed product in the Option Territory, the Company may be liable for up to $82.5 million in sales milestone payments. Additionally, the Company may be required to make tiered royalty payments ranging from a low to high teens percentage of net sales on a product-by-product basis in the Licensed Territory. Under the Summit Collaboration Agreement, a joint steering committee was established to plan, monitor and coordinate future development activities for ezutromid and future generation small molecule utrophin modulators. Summit was solely responsible for all research and development costs for the licensed products until December 31, 2017 . Thereafter, Summit will be responsible for 55.0% of the budgeted research and development costs related to the licensed products in the Licensed Territory, and the Company will be responsible for 45.0% of such costs. Any costs in excess of 110.0% of the budgeted amount are borne by the party that incurred such costs. Summit is also obligated to spend a specified minimum amount on the research and development of certain licensed products prior to the end of 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company incurred approximately $8.6 million in collaboration expense for ezutromid, with no similar activity in 2017 and 2016. In June 2018, Summit announced that it is discontinuing the Phase 2 clinical trial on ezutromid. As a result, no development, regulatory or sales milestones were deemed as probable of being achieved as of December 31, 2018. For the years ended December 31, 2017 , and 2016, the Company recorded a $22.0 million milestone payment and a $40.0 million up-front payment to Summit, respectively, as research and development expense in its consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. University of Western Australia In April 2013, the Company and UWA entered into an agreement under which an existing exclusive license agreement between the Company and UWA was amended and restated (the “Amended and Restated UWA License Agreement”). The Amended and Restated UWA License Agreement grants the Company specific rights to the treatment of DMD by inducing the skipping of certain exons. EXONDYS 51 falls under the scope of the license agreement. Under the Amended and Restated UWA License Agreement, the Company may be required to make payments of up to $6.0 million in the aggregate to UWA based on the successful achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones relating to EXONDYS 51 and up to five additional product candidates. The Company may also be obligated to make payments to UWA of up to $20.0 million upon the achievement of certain sales milestones. Additionally, the Company may be required to pay a low-single-digit percentage royalty on net sales of products covered by issued patents licensed from UWA during the term of the Amended and Restated UWA License Agreement. However, the Company has the option to purchase future royalties up-front. Under this option, prior to the First Amendment (defined below), the Company could elect to make a one-time royalty payment of $30.0 million to UWA. In June 2016, the Company and UWA entered into the first amendment to the Amended and Restated UWA License Agreement (the “First Amendment”). Under the First Amendment, the Company was obligated to make an up-front payment of $7.0 million to UWA upon execution of the amendment. Under the terms of the First Amendment, UWA has waived certain rights and amended the timing of certain payments under the Amended and Restated UWA License Agreement, including lowering the up-front payment that is due by the Company upon exercise of the option to purchase future royalties up-front. Upon exercise of the option to purchase future royalties up-front, the Company will be obligated to make a $23.0 million payment to UWA. Additionally, the Company would still be obligated to make up to $20.0 million in payments to UWA upon achievement of certain sales milestones. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded $7.6 million relating to the development milestone and up-front payments to UWA as research and development expense in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss as the Amended and Restated UWA License Agreement and its First Amendment were entered into before the FDA approval of EXONDYS 51. The Company did not incur any milestone expense for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. Additionally, corresponding to the FDA approval and the subsequent commercial sale of EXONDYS 51, the Company recorded a $1.0 million milestone payment as an in-license right in its consolidated balance sheet in 2016. As of December 31, 2018 , the in-license right is recorded net of $0.3 million accumulated amortization on the consolidated balance sheets. The amortization of the in-licensed right is F-16 recorded as cost of sales in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. During the years ended December 31, 2018 , 2017, and 2016, the Company did not incur royalty expense nor did it make any royalty payments to UWA but may be obligated to make these payments in the future. 4. GAIN FROM SALE OF PRIORITY REVIEW VOUCHER In February 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with Gilead Sciences, Inc. (“Gilead”) to sell the Company’s Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher (“PRV”). The Company received the PRV when EXONDYS 51 was approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with DMD amenable to exon 51 skipping. Following the early termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, in March 2017, the Company completed its sale of the PRV to a subsidiary of Gilead. Pursuant to the agreement, the subsidiary of Gilead paid the Company $125.0 million, which was recorded as a gain from sale of the PRV as it did not have a carrying value at the time of the sale. 5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The tables below present information about the Company’s financial assets that are measured and carried at fair value and indicate the level within the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques it utilizes to determine such fair value: Fair Value Measurement as of December 31, 2018 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 (in thousands) Assets Money market funds $ 42,920 $ 42,920 $ — $ — Commercial paper 125,907 — 125,907 — Government and government agency bonds 760,235 760,235 — — Corporate bonds 43,468 43,468 — — Strategic equity investments 31,739 1,739 — 30,000 Certificates of deposit 1,001 1,001 — — Total $ 1,005,270 $ 849,363 $ 125,907 $ 30,000 Fair Value Measurement as of December 31, 2017 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 (in thousands) Assets Money market funds $ 352,370 $ 352,370 $ — $ — Commercial paper 133,368 — 133,368 — Government and government agency bonds 294,717 284,745 9,972 — Corporate bonds 127,956 127,956 — — Certificates of deposit 648 648 — — Total $ 909,059 $ 765,719 $ 143,340 $ — The Company’s assets with fair value categorized as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy include money market funds, government and government agency bonds, corporate bonds, certificate of deposit, and the Company’s strategic investment in Lysogene, a publicly traded company in France, as more fully described in Note 3, License and Collaboration Agreements . Certain of the government and government agency bonds and corporate bonds are publicly traded fixed income securities and are presented as cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s assets with fair value categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy consist of commercial paper and government and government agency bonds. These assets have been initially valued at the transaction price and subsequently valued, at the end of each reporting period, through income-based approaches utilizing market observable data. The Company’s assets with fair value categorized as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy consists of a strategic investment in Series A preferred stock of Lacerta as more fully described in Note 3, License and Collaboration Agreements . The fair value of the asset is based on a cost approach corroborated by the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The most significant assumptions in the F-17 option pricing model include historical volatility of similar public companies, estimated term through Lacerta’s potential exit and a risk free rate based on certain U.S. Treasury rates. The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and revolving line of credit approximate fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments. The carrying amounts for the term loan approximate fair value based on market activity for other debt instruments with similar characteristics and comparable risk. 6.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS The following table summarizes the components of the Company’s intangible assets for each of the periods indicated: As of December 31, 2018 As of December 31, 2017 (in thousands) Patents $ 5,773 $ 7,660 In-licensed rights 5,626 6,491 Software licenses 175 204 Total $ 11,574 $ 14,355 The in-licensed rights relate to agreements with BioMarin and UWA. Following the execution of the settlement and license agreements with BioMarin in July 2017, the Company recorded a $6.6 million intangible asset related to EXONDYS 51 in the U.S. Additionally, as a result of the FDA approval and the subsequent commercial sale of EXONDYS 51, the Company made a $1.0 million sales milestone to UWA and, accordingly, recorded an in-licensed right. The in-licensed rights are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the related patent because the life of the related patent reflects the expected time period that the Company will benefit from the in-licensed right. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded $0.9 million, $1.1 million and less than $0.1 million, respectively, of amortization related to the in-license rights. F-21 Patent costs consist primarily of external legal costs, filing fees incurred to file patent applications and renewal fees on proprietary technology developed or licensed by the Company. Patent costs associated with applying for a patent, being issued a patent and annual renewal fees are capitalized. Costs to defend a patent and costs to invalidate a competitor’s patent or patent application are expensed as incurred. Patent costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated economic lives or the initial term of the patents, which is generally 20 years. Patent amortization expense was $0.7 million, $0.6 million and $0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company also expensed the remaining net book value of previously capitalized patents that were later abandoned of $0.1 million, $0.6 million and $0.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which were included in research and development expenses on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Additionally, the Company reviewed its patent portfolio and identified technology that the Company will no longer pursue. As a result, the Company impaired these patent assets and recorded $3.8 million in impairment loss, which was included in research and development expense on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. The following table summarizes the estimated future amortization for intangible assets for the next five years: As of December 31, 2018 (in thousands) 2019 1,490 2020 1,300 2021 1,299 2022 1,298 2023 1,297 Total $ 6,684 12.

RESTRUCTURING In March 2016, the Company announced a long-term plan to consolidate all of the Company’s operations to Massachusetts as part of a strategic plan to increase operational efficiency. As part of the consolidation, research activities and some employees transitioned to the Company’s facilities in Andover and Cambridge, Massachusetts. As of December 31, 2017, the relocations and terminations were completed. The second floor and the first floor of the Company’s facility in Corvallis, Oregon were vacated and closed and made available for sub-leasing in December 2016 and April 2017, respectively. Using a discounted cash flow methodology and based on F-22 monthly rent payments as well as estimated sublease income, the Company recognized a total of approximately $1.5 million and $2.3 million, in restructuring expenses for the second and the first floor, respectively. In June 2018, the Corvallis facility was sold, and the Company entered into a rental termination agreement with the new landlord regarding the space made available for sub-lease. As a result, we relieved the remaining $2.2 million of cease-use liability related to this space in June 2018, which was recorded as a reduction to selling, general and administrative expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company recognized $(2.2) million, $3.0 million and $4.6 million as restructuring expenses, respectively. For the Year Ended December 31 2018 2017 2016 (in thousands) Research and development $ — $ 188 $ 2,013 Selling, general and administrative (2,222 ) 2,832 2,549 Total restructuring expenses $ (2,222 ) $ 3,020 $ 4,562 The following table summarizes the restructuring reserve for each of the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31 2018 2017 (in thousands) Restructuring reserve beginning balance $ 2,933 $ 1,588 Restructuring expenses incurred during the period — 3,020 Amounts paid during the period (711 ) (1,675 ) Reversal of cease-use liability (2,222 ) — Restructuring reserve ending balance $ — $ 2,933 14. INDEBTEDNESS 2024 Convertible Notes On November 14, 2017, the Company issued $570.0 million senior notes due on November 15, 2024 (the “2024 Notes”). The 2024 Notes were issued at face value and bear interest at the rate of 1.50% per annum, payable semi-annually in cash on each May 15 and November 15, commencing on May 15, 2018. Upon conversion, the Company may pay cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and stock, as determined by the Company in its discretion. The 2024 Notes may be convertible into 7,763,552 shares of the Company’s common stock under certain circumstances prior to maturity at a conversion rate of 13.621 shares per $1,000 principal amount of the 2024 Notes, which represents a conversion price of $73.42 per share, subject to adjustment under certain conditions. The Company allocated the proceeds received from issuance of the 2024 Notes between the liability component and the embedded conversion option, or equity component. The liability component was determined by measuring the fair value of similar notes that do not include the embedded conversion option. The Company allocated $161.1 million to the equity component, which was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the 2024 Notes. The equity component, net of allocated offering costs of $4.2 million, was recorded as an increase additional paid-in capital. The equity component, plus $10.6 million of offering costs allocated to the liability component, represent the total debt discount on the 2024 Notes at issuance. The debt discount will be amortized under an effective interest method and recorded as additional interest expense over the life of the 2024 Notes. The effective interest rate on the liability component of the 2024 Notes for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was 6.9%. Upon the occurrence of a “fundamental change”, which includes (1) change in beneficial ownership of the Company where any person/group possesses more than 50% of the voting power of the Company, (2) consolidation or merger of the Company, (3) shareholder approval of a liquidation plan or (4) the Company is delisted from NYSE or NASDAQ, the holders may require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the 2024 Notes for cash at 100% of the principal amount of the 2024 Notes being purchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. Additionally, upon the occurrence of a “make-whole fundamental change” prior to the maturity date, the Company shall adjust the conversion rate on a sliding scale basis detailed in the agreement F-23 To minimize the impact of potential dilution upon conversion of the 2024 Notes, the Company separately entered into capped call transactions with certain counterparties. The capped calls have a strike price of $73.42 and a cap price of $104.88 and are exercisable when and if the 2024 Notes are converted. If, upon conversion of the 2024 Notes, the price of the Company’s common stock is between the strike price and the cap price of the capped calls, the counterparties will deliver shares of the Company’s common stock and/or cash with an aggregate value equal to the difference between the price of the Company’s common stock at the conversion date and the strike price, multiplied by the number of shares of the Company’s common stock related to the capped calls being exercised. The Company paid $50.9 million for these capped calls transactions, which was recorded as additional paid-in capital. Term Loan and Revolving Line of Credit In July 2017, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the “Amended and Restated Credit and Security Agreement”) which provides a term loan (“July 2017 Term Loan”) of $60.0 million with MidCap Financial Trust (“MidCap”). Borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit and Security Agreement bore interest at a rate per annum equal to 6.25%, plus the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). In addition to paying interest on the outstanding principal under the Amended and Restated Credit and Security Agreement, the Company paid an origination fee equal to 0.50% of the amount of the term loan when advanced under the Amended and Restated Credit and Security Agreement and would be liable for a final payment fee equal to 2.00% of the amount borrowed under the Amended and Restated Credit and Security Agreement when the July 2017 Term Loan was fully repaid. Commencing on July 1, 2018, and continuing for the remaining thirty six months of the facility, the Company was required to make monthly principal payments of approximately $0.8 million, set forth in the Amended and Restated Credit and Security Agreement, subject to certain adjustments as described therein. The facility would mature in July 2021. In July 2017, the Company also entered into a revolving credit and security agreement (the “Revolving Credit Agreement”) which provides an aggregate revolving loan commitment of $40.0 million (which may be increased by an additional tranche of $20.0 million) with MidCap. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement bore interest at a rate of 3.95%, plus the one-month LIBOR. In addition to paying interest on the outstanding principal under the Revolving Credit Agreement, the Company paid $0.2 million of origination fees, which was 0.50% of the amount of the revolving loan. The Company recognized this origination fee as other asset and it was amortized to interest expense over the term of the revolving loan. In September 2018, the Company terminated both the Amended and Restated Credit and Security Agreement and the Revolving Credit Agreement with MidCap and paid off the remaining outstanding balance of principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the July 2017 Term Loan. As a result, the Company recorded a debt extinguishment loss of $2.3 million primarily related to the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and prepayment fees. Mortgage Loans The Company had two mortgage loans outstanding which bear interest at 4.75% with the original maturity date of February 2027 and were collateralized by a facility in Corvallis, Oregon. At December 31, 2017, these loans had unpaid principal balances of $0.8 million and $0.5 million, for a total indebtedness of $1.3 million, and were presented as current portion of long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet. In connection with the sale of this property in January 2018, the two long-term mortgage loans were paid off. As of December 31, 2018, the Company recorded approximately $420.6 million as long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheets. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded $33.7 million, $5.8 million and $1.9 million of interest expense, respectively. The following table summarizes the Company’s debt facilities for the periods indicated: As of December 31, 2018 As of December 31, 2017 (in thousand) (in thousand) Par value of the 2024 Notes $ 570,000 $ 570,000 Unamortized discount - equity component (140,206 ) (158,890 ) Unamortized discount - debt issuance costs (9,240 ) (10,449 ) Net carrying value of convertible debt 420,554 400,661 Net carrying value of other debt facilities — 30,390 Net carrying value of total debt facilities 420,554 431,051 Fair value of convertible debt $ 952,681 $ 619,641 F-24 The fair value of the Company’s 2024 Notes is based on open market trades and is classified as level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. The following table summarizes the total gross payments due under the Company’s debt arrangements: As of December 31, 2018 (in thousands) 2019 $ — 2020 — 2021 — 2022 — 2023 — Thereafter 570,000 Total Payments $ 570,000 15. EQUITY FINANCING In November 2018, the Company sold approximately 4.1 million shares of common stock through an underwritten public offering, including 0.3 million shares sold to the underwriters. The offering price was $131.00 per share. The Company received net proceeds of approximately $513.4 million from the offering, net of commission and offering expenses of approximately $24.6 million. In July 2017, the Company sold approximately 8.8 million shares of common stock through an underwritten public offering, including 1.2 million shares sold to the underwriters. The offering price was $42.50 per share. The Company received net proceeds of approximately $354.0 million from the offering, net of commission and offering expenses of approximately $20.0 million. In September 2016, the Company sold approximately 5.8 million shares of common stock through an underwritten public offering at a price of $59.75 per share. The Company received net proceeds of approximately $327.4 million from the offering net of commission and offering expenses of approximately $17.6 million. In June 2016, the Company sold approximately 2.1 million shares of common stock through an underwritten public offering at a price of $17.84 per share. The Company received net proceeds of approximately $37.3 million from the offering net of offering expense of approximately $0.2 million. 16. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION In June 2011, the Company’s stockholders approved the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (“2011 Plan”). The 2011 Plan, which authorized 13.0 million shares of common stock to be issued, allows for the grant of stock options, SARs, RSAs, RSUs, performance shares and performance units. In June 2016 and 2015, shareholders authorized the issuance of an additional 1.3 million and 1.7 million shares, respectively, of common stock under the 2011 Plan. As of December 31, 2018, the 2011 Plan was merged into the 2018 Plan (defined below). As a result, there were no shares of common stock remaining available for future grant under the 2011 Plan. In June 2013, the Company’s stockholders approved the 2013 ESPP with approximately 0.3 million shares of common stock available to be issued. In June 2016, the Company’s stockholders approved an additional approximately 0.3 million shares of common stock available to be issued to be added to the 2013 ESPP. As of December 31, 2018, 0.2 million shares of common stock remain available for future grant under the 2013 ESPP. In September 2014, the Company initiated the 2014 Employment Commencement Incentive Plan (“2014 Plan”) with approximately 0.6 million shares of common stock available to be issued. In October 2015, June 2017 and July 2018, the 2014 Plan was increased by 1.0 million, 3.8 million and 1.2 million shares of common stock available to be issued, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, 0.9 million shares of common stock remain available for future grant under the 2014 Plan. F-25 In June 2018, the Company’s stockholders approved the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (“2018 Plan”). The 2018 Plan, which authorized 2.9 million shares of common stock to be issued, allows for the grant of stock options, SARs, RSAs, RSUs, performance shares and performance units. The 2011 Plan was merged into the 2018 Plan and, as a result, all remaining shares in the 2011 Plan were transferred into the 2018 Plan. As of December 31, 2018, 4.4 million shares of common stock remain available for future grant under the 2018 Plan. Stock Options In general, stock options have a ten-year term and vest over a four-year period, with one-fourth of the underlying shares vesting on the first anniversary of the grant and 1/48th of the underlying shares vesting monthly thereafter, such that the underlying shares will be fully vested on the fourth anniversary of the grant, subject to the terms of the applicable plan under which they were granted. The fair values of stock options granted during the periods presented were measured on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, with the following assumptions: For the Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Risk-free interest rate (1) 2.5 - 3.0% 1.6 - 2.1% 1.1 – 1.8% Expected dividend yield (2) — — — Expected term (3) 5.06 years 4.2 - 4.8 years 4.2 – 4.8 years Expected volatility (4) 52.4 - 60.8% 54.0 - 63.0% 78.2 – 137.1 % (1) The risk-free interest rate is estimated using an average of Treasury bill interest rates over a historical period commensurate with the expected term of the option that correlates to the prevailing interest rates at the time of grant. (2) The expected dividend yield is zero as the Company has not paid any dividends to date and does not expect to pay dividends in the future. (3) The expected term is estimated using historical exercise behavior. (4) Upon commercialization of EXONDYS 51 in the U.S., the Company’s future risk profile changed. As a result, starting January 1, 2017, the Company estimates expected volatility by using only implied volatility in exchange-traded options of the Company’s common stock. Prior to January 1, 2017, the expected volatility was estimated using a blend of calculated volatility of the Company’s common stock over a historical period and implied volatility in exchange-traded options of the Company’s common stock. The amounts estimated according to the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model may not be indicative of the actual values realized upon the exercise of these options by the holders.

These options have a five-year cliff vesting schedule. The fair value of $13.48 for these options was determined by a lattice model with Monte Carlo simulations. The remaining are service-based options which have a four-year vesting schedule with 25% vesting on the first anniversary and 1/48 monthly thereafter. F-26 The weighted-average grant date fair value per share of stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $44.66, $14.78 and $12.46, respectively.

Vesting is achieved based upon the FDA approval of EXONDYS 51 and submission of MAA for eteplirsen to the EMA and continuing service over a four-year period. As a result of both milestones achieved in 2016, 50% of the February 2016 performance grants were triggered to be vested immediately and the remaining 50% are subject to the remaining service conditions of the awards. Additionally, in June 2013, the Company granted to executives approximately 0.4 million stock options with service- and performance-based conditions (“June 2013 Performance Grants”). Vesting was achieved based upon various regulatory approval for EXONDYS 51 and filings of investigational new drug submissions for other drug candidates and continuing service over a four-year period. 80% of the June 2013 Performance Grants was vested as of December 31, 2016 and the remaining 20% were forfeited. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company has recognized approximately $0.2 million, $0.9 million and $5.0 million in stock-based compensation expense related to the options with performance-based criteria, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, the total stock-based compensation expense related to non-vested awards with only service-vesting conditions not yet recognized is approximately $73.0 million, those with service- and performance-based conditions approximates $0.2 million and those with market-based conditions approximates $31.0 million. Restricted Stock Awards The Company grants RSAs to members of its board of directors and certain employees.

If the sales targets are achieved within the required time frame, the number of RSAs may be increased from 71,925 to 89,906 shares. In December 2017, the Company modified the expiration date of these RSAs from June 30, 2018 to January 1, 2019. As a result of this modification, the fair value was changed from $48.94 to $54.29. Through December 31, 2017, the Company had not recorded any stock-based compensation expense associated with these awards as the achievement of the performance conditions was not deemed probable. However, as of December 31, 2018, the first sales target related to these RSAs was achieved and the second F-27 target was not deemed as probable of being achieved. Accordingly, the Company recognized approximately $3.3 million of stock-based compensation expense during the year ended December 31, 2018, related to the achievement of the first performance condition. Restricted Stock Units The Company also grants RSUs to members of its board of directors and employees.

The first performance condition of these RSUs was achieved in June 2017. The second performance condition was deemed as probable of being achieved in September 2017 and was achieved in May 2018. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the C ompany recognized approximately $0.2 million and $2.9 million of stock-based compensation expense, respectively, related to the performance condition s of these RSUs. The third performance milestone was not deemed as probable of being achieved as of December 31, 2018. If and when deemed probable that the last performance milestone may be achieved within the required time frame, the Company may recognize up to $0.7 million of stock-based compensation related to the third performance milestone of these grants. Stock Appreciation Rights The Company issues SARs to employees on the same terms as options granted to employees. The grant date fair value of the SARs is determined using the same valuation assumptions as for stock options described above. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the SARs. As of December 31, 2018, there were 100,000 SARs vested and outstanding. These SARs were granted to the Company’s Executive Vice President and CFO in November 2012 and have an exercise price of $23.85 per share. The SARs are classified as equity as the agreements require settlement in shares of stock.

In December 2012, the Company licensed certain intellectual property of Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. to its wholly owned subsidiary, Sarepta International C.V. The parties also entered into a contract research agreement under which Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. performs research services for Sarepta International C.V. In January 2016, Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. entered into a manufacturing and distribution agreement as well as service agreement with Sarepta International C.V. In conjunction with its recent filings, it was determined that beginning in 2016, Sarepta International C.V. is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business by the entity in the U.S. and, accordingly, the 2016, 2017 and 2018 losses are subject to U.S. income taxes. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, Sarepta International C.V. incurred losses of $67.6 million, $143.8 million, and $174.9 million, respectively. F-31 The following table summarizes the analysis of the deferred tax assets and liabilities for each of the periods indicated: As of December 31, 2018 2017 (in thousands) Deferred tax assets: Net operating loss carryforwards $ 212,342 $ 144,897 Difference in depreciation and amortization 55,162 1,210 Research and development tax credits 67,309 44,306 Stock-based compensation 15,538 14,392 Deferred rent 4,831 1,210 Deferred revenue 888 904 Capitalized inventory 22,943 22,127 Other 15,727 4,071 Total deferred tax assets 394,740 233,117 Deferred tax liabilities: Debt discount (25,162 ) (28,548 ) Total deferred tax liabilities (25,162 ) (28,548 ) Valuation allowance (369,345 ) (204,569 ) Net deferred tax assets $ 233 $ — The Company has evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of its U.S. net deferred tax assets, which are comprised principally of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, research and development tax credit carryforwards, stock-based compensation expense, capitalized inventory and intangibles. Under the applicable accounting standards, management has considered the Company’s history of losses and concluded that it is more likely than not that the Company will not recognize the benefits of net federal and state deferred tax assets. Accordingly, a full valuation allowance of the U.S. net deferred tax asset had been established at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The net change in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was an increase of $164.8 million and a decrease of $69.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. This increase for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to the generation of federal and state net operating losses. The Company generated foreign deferred tax assets mainly consisting of net operating loss carryforwards, stock-based compensation and unrealized gain/losses. Based upon the income projections in the majority of the foreign jurisdictions, the Company believes it will realize the benefit of its future deductible differences. As such, the Company has not recorded a valuation allowance against all foreign jurisdictions except for Brazil and Switzerland. Brazil and Switzerland generated deferred tax assets, which consist of net operating loss carryforwards and stock-based compensation expense. A full valuation allowance has been recorded against these deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $438.5 million and $503.3 million, respectively, available to reduce future taxable income. The federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of $240.0 million and $503.3 million will expire at various dates between 2019 and 2038. Federal net operating loss of $198.5 million can be carried forward indefinitely. In addition, the Company had $386.3 million of federal net operating loss carryforwards generated by its wholly-owned subsidiary, Sarepta International C.V., of which $318.7 million will expire between 2036 and 2037. $67.6 million of Sarepta International C.V.’s net operating losses can be carried forward indefinitely. Utilization of these net operating losses could be limited under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and similar state laws based on ownership changes and the value of the Company’s stock. Additionally, the Company has $50.3 million and $20.9 million of federal and state research and development credits, respectively, available to offset future taxable income. These federal and state research and development credits begin to expire between 2019 and 2038 and between 2019 and 2033, respectively. The Company also has foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $55.2 million, mainly derived from the net operating loss generated by Sarepta International Holdings GmbH, which will begin to expire in 2024. F-32 The follow table summarizes the reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of total unrecognized tax benefits for each of the periods indicated: For the Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 (in thousands) Balance at beginning of the period $ 5,134 $ 4,644 $ 3,706 Increase related to current year tax positions 2,164 735 801 Increase related to prior year tax positions 30,246 — 137 Decrease related to prior year tax positions — (245 ) — Balance at end of the period $ 37,544 $ 5,134 $ 4,644 The balance of total unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2018, if recognized, would not affect the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations, due to a full valuation allowance against the Company’s U.S. deferred tax assets. The Company does not expect that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly in the next twelve months. The Company, including its domestic subsidiaries, files consolidated U.S. federal and state income tax returns. The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. It had no accrual for interest or penalties on its balance sheet at December 31, 2018 or 2017. No interest and/or penalties were recognized in 2017 or 2016. 20. NET LOSS PER SHARE Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding. Given that the Company recorded a net loss for each of the periods presented, there is no difference between basic and diluted net loss per share since the effect of common stock equivalents would be anti-dilutive and are, therefore, excluded from the diluted net loss per share calculation. For the Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 (in thousands, except per share amounts) Net loss $ (361,918 ) $ (50,688 ) $ (267,265 ) Weighted-average number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding: Weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for computing basic loss per share 66,250 58,818 48,697 Dilutive effect of outstanding stock awards and stock options after application of the treasury stock method* — — — Weighted-average number of shares of common stock and dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding for computing diluted loss per share 66,250 58,818 48,697 Net loss per share — basic and diluted $ (5.46 ) $ (0.86 ) $ (5.49 ) * For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, stock options, RSAs, RSUs, SARs and ESPP to purchase approximately 9.1 million and 9.4 million shares of common stock, respectively, were excluded from the net loss per share calculation as their effect would have been anti-dilutive. For the year ended December 31, 2016, stock options, RSAs and SARs to purchase approximately 5.7 million shares of common stock, were excluded from the net loss per share calculation as their effect would have been anti-dilutive. The Company accounts for the effect of the 2024 Notes on diluted net earnings per share using the if-converted method as they may be settled in cash or shares at the Company’s option. While the closing price on December 31, 2018 exceeded the conversion price of $73.42, the potential shares issuable under the 2024 Notes were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share as they were anti-dilutive using the if-converted method. In the period of conversion, the 2024 Notes will have no impact on diluted net earnings (loss) if they are settled in cash and will have an impact on diluted earnings per share if the Notes are settled in shares upon conversion and when the Company in an income position. F-33 21. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Lease Obligations In June 2013, the Company entered into a lease agreement (“Cambridge lease”) for its headquarters located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In April and September 2018, the Company entered into the seventh and eighth amendment, respectively, to its Cambridge lease which extended the original term of the lease to September 30, 2025 and increased the total rental space to approximately 163,842 square feet. The agreement calls for a security deposit in the form of a letter of credit totaling $1.0 million. The Company purchased a certificate of deposit to meet the requirement and it is recorded as a long-term restricted investment in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. In March and July of 2018, the Company entered into sublease agreements in Andover, Massachusetts, to lease a total of 23,102 square feet of additional office space. These subleases expires in December 2020. In November 2018, the Company entered into a sublease agreement in Burlington, Massachusetts, to lease 44,740 square feet of additional office and lab space. The sublease expires in January 2022. In December 2018, the Company entered into lease agreements in Dublin and Columbus, Ohio, to lease 22,600 square feet and 77,679 square feet, respectively, of additional office and lab space. The leases expire in November 2019 and June 2026, respectively. In August 2015 and December 2016, the Company entered into agreements to sublease 15,077 square feet and 7,461 square feet, respectively, of office space to two unrelated third parties. The subleases expired in March and December 2017, respectively. The Company also leased laboratory and office space in Corvallis, Oregon which would expire in December 2020. The second floor and the first floor of the facility were vacated and closed and made available for sub-leasing in December 2016 and April 2017, respectively. The lease was terminated in June 2018. The following table summarizes the aggregate future minimum payments under the Company’s leases: As of December 31, 2018 (in thousands) 2019 $ 11,588 2020 11,395 2021 12,558 2022 10,757 2023 10,898 Thereafter 20,524 Total minimum lease payments $ 77,720 Royalty Obligations The Company is obligated to pay royalties on net sales of certain of its products. The royalty rates range from the low-single-digit to high teens percentages for both inside and outside the U.S. Under the license agreement with BioMarin signed in July 2017, the Company is required to make a mid-single-digit percentage of royalty on the net product sales inside the U.S. and maybe required to make a high-single-digit percentage of royalty on net product sales outside the U.S. Under the Amended and Restated License Agreement with UWA signed in April 2013, the Company may be obligated to pay a low-single-digit percentage of royalty on the net sales of products exceeding certain amounts, which includes EXONDYS 51. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded $15.1 and $4.7 million, respectively, of royalty payments to BioMarin on its consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Milestone Obligations The Company has collaboration and license agreements for which it could be obligated to pay up-front, development, regulatory and sales milestones as a product candidate proceeds from the submission of an investigational new drug application through approval for commercial sale and beyond. As of December 31, 2018, the Company may be obligated to make up to $378.8 million of future development, regulatory, up-front royalty and sales milestone payments associated with its collaboration and license agreements. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company recognized approximately $142.4million, $22.0 million and $47.6 million relating to certain up-front and development milestone payments as research and development expense, respectively, under these agreements. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company also recorded $6.6 million and $1.0 million as F-34 in-licensed right assets, respectively, corresponding to the execution of the settlement and license agreements with BioMarin and the first sale of EXONDYS 51, with no similar activity as of December 31, 2018. Other Funding Commitments The Company has several on-going clinical trials in various clinical trial stages. Its most significant clinical trial expenditures are to contract research organizations (“CROs”). The CRO contracts are generally cancellable at the Company’s option. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has approximately $71.6 million in cancellable future commitments based on existing CRO contracts. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company recognized approximately $19.6 million, $13.9 million and $8.5 million, respectively, for expenditures incurred by CROs. Manufacturing Obligations The Company has entered into long-term contractual arrangements from time to time for the provision of goods and services. Brammer Bio MA, LLC In June 2018, the Company entered into a Development, Commercial Manufacturing and Supply Agreement (“Brammer Manufacturing Agreement”), with Brammer Bio MA, LLC (“Brammer”). Pursuant to the terms of the Brammer Manufacturing Agreement, Brammer agreed to provide the Company with access to clinical and commercial manufacturing capacity for its gene therapy programs. As part of the Brammer Manufacturing Agreement, the Company will purchase product in batches from Brammer, subject to minimum and maximum annual purchase requirements. Further, the Company: (i) was required to make a $20.0 million advance payment to Brammer upon execution of the agreement, (ii) was required to make two non-refundable payments of $5.0 million each to Brammer in the third and fourth quarter of 2018 to be used in the specification, selection, and procurement of the related process equipment to be utilized under the agreement, and (iii) is required to make a $10.0 million quarterly capacity access fee payment to Brammer throughout the term of the agreement. However, through June 30, 2019, a reduced quarterly capacity access fee will be in effect as Brammer works towards achieving full capacity at its facility. In addition, one-tenth of the $20.0 million advance payment will be applied as a credit to the quarterly capacity access fees due and payable from July 1, 2019 through December 31, 2021, resulting in a net capacity access fee of $8.0 million. The term of the Brammer Manufacturing Agreement will continue for a period of six years following the first regulatory approval of a product manufactured under the agreement. The term will automatically renew for successive two years unless the Company notifies Brammer of its intention not to renew (no less than twenty-four months prior to the expiration of the term). The Company also has the ability to terminate the agreement prior to expiration but would be required to continue remitting capacity access fees to Brammer for up to eight additional quarters. The Company has determined that the Brammer Manufacturing Agreement does not contain an embedded lease because it does not convey the right to control the use of the facility or related equipment. This conclusion was based on the Company’s inability or right to control physical access to Brammer’s facility and the related equipment, and the ability of one or more parties, other than the Company, to take more than a minor amount of the output that will be produced during the term of the agreement. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has made payments totaling $40.0 million to Brammer under the Brammer Manufacturing Agreement consisting of: (i) the $20.0 million advance payment made in June 2018, (ii) the two $5.0 million process equipment fees paid in July 2018 and October 2018, and (iii) the first two reduced quarterly capacity access fee payments of $5.0 million made in July 2018 and September 2018. Of the cumulative amount paid of $40.0 million, $5.0 million was recorded as an other current asset and $35.0 million as an other non-current asset, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The advance payment and process equipment fees were capitalized and will be amortized over their expected economic benefit to research and development expense, prior to regulatory approval of the related product, commencing upon the first batch delivery to the Company, which is currently estimated to occur in July 2019. Upon regulatory approval, amortization expense will be classified to cost of inventory with the recognition in cost of sales as the sales of product occur. Capacity access fee payments made prior to the first batch delivery to the Company will be capitalized and amortized to expense in a manner similar to the advance payment and process equipment fees. Capacity access fee payments made subsequent to the first batch delivery to the Company will be expensed as incurred to research and development expense, prior to regulatory approval of the related product. Upon regulatory approval, the expense associated with capacity access fee payments will be classified to cost of inventory with the recognition in cost of sales as the sales of product occur. In the event the Company does not expect services under the Brammer Manufacturing Agreement to be rendered, the capitalized payments will be charged to expense. F-35 Paragon Bioservices, Inc. In October 2018, the Company entered into a manufacturing collaboration agreement (“Paragon Collaboration Agreement”) with Paragon Bioservices, Inc. (“Paragon”). Pursuant to the terms of the Paragon Collaboration Agreement, Paragon agreed to provide the Company with two dedicated clean room suites and an option to reserve two additional clean room suites (“Optional Clean Room Suites”) for its gene therapy programs. As part of the Paragon Collaboration Agreement, the Company will purchase product in batches from Paragon subject to minimum annual purchase requirements. Further, the Company is required to pay Paragon: (i) use fees of $1.0 million per year per clean room suite after the clean rooms are fully qualified and validated to manufacture the Company’s materials, and (ii) clean room reservation fees, which could total up to $48.0 million if the Company exercises the option to reserve the Optional Clean Room Suites. Additional use fees and reservation fees are required if the Company has equipment needs beyond the basic equipment package included in the initial clean room suites. In addition, Paragon will provide the Company with a credit of up to 100% of the clean room use fee if certain clean room capacity utilization thresholds are met. The term of the Paragon Collaboration Agreement will continue until the earlier of: (i) the latest expiration date of any commercial supply agreement in effect, or (ii) December 31, 2025. The Company has the ability to terminate the Paragon Collaboration Agreement prior to expiration, subject to potential additional financial consideration. The Company has concluded that the Paragon Collaboration Agreement contains an embedded lease as the Company has the right to operate the clean room suites in a manner it determines while also controlling more than a minor amount of the output during the term of the agreement. The Company also concluded that it is not the deemed owner during construction of the clean room suites nor does the agreement represent a capital lease under ASC 840, “ Leases ”. As a result, the Paragon Collaboration Agreement will be accounted for as an operating lease. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has made reservation fee payments totaling $26.0 million to Paragon, which was recorded as an other non-current asset in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. This amount, along with any additional reservation fee payments made, will be amortized on a straight-line basis as rent expense over the term of the embedded lease, commencing upon the date that the Company controls the physical use of the clean room suites, currently anticipated to occur in the fourth quarter of 2019. Use fees associated with the clean room suites are considered contingent rental payments, and will be charged to rent expense when (and if) incurred. Rent expense recognized prior to regulatory approval of the related product will be classified to research and development expense. Upon regulatory approval, rent expense will be classified to cost of inventory with the recognition in cost of sales as the sales of product occur. Aldevron, LLC In December 2018, the Company entered into a Clinical and Commercial Supply Agreement (the “CCSA”) with Aldevron LLC (“Aldevron”) for the supply of plasmid DNA to fulfill its needs for gene therapy clinical trials and commercial supply. Pursuant to the terms of the CCSA, Aldevron agreed to reserve a certain number of manufacturing slots (“Reserved Slots”) on a quarterly basis. The initial term of the CCSA expires on December 31, 2019. The Company has an option to extend the CCSA to December 31, 2020 (the “2020 Option”) and other option to extend the term of the CCSA for an additional year to December 31, 2021 (the “2021 Renewal Right”). The Company may be required to make up to $60.0 million in prepayments associated with the CCSA should the Company exercise both the 2020 Option and the 2021 Renewal Right. The prepayments will be credited back to Sarepta, until exhausted, for each batch of product delivered by Aldevron, in an amount equal to 50% of the batch invoice amount. The Company has determined that the CCSA does not contain an embedded lease because it does not convey the right to control the use of Aldevron’s facility or related equipment therein. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has made a prepayment of $10.0 million to Aldevron under the CCSA, which was recorded as an other current asset in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In the event the Company does not expect services under the CCSA to be rendered to fully exhaust any prepayments made to Aldevron, the applicable balance will be charged to expense at the time this determination is made. F-36 The following table presents non-cancelable contractual obligations arising from long-term contractual arrangements: As of December 31, 2018 (in thousands) 2019 $ 182,352 2020 34,000 2021 34,000 2022 42,000 2023 42,000 Thereafter 124,000 Total manufacturing commitments $ 458,352 Litigation In the normal course of business, the Company may from time to time be named as a party to various legal claims, actions and complaints, including matters involving securities, employment, intellectual property, effects from the use of therapeutics utilizing its technology, or others. For example, a complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts on December 3, 2014 styled William Kader, Individually and on Behalf of All Others Similarly Situated v. Sarepta Therapeutics Inc., Christopher Garabedian, and Sandesh Mahatme ( Kader v. Sarepta et.al 1:14-cv-14318 ). On March 20, 2015, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint asserting violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10b-5 against the Company, and Chris Garabedian and Sandy Mahatme (“Individual Defendants,” and collectively with the Company, the “Kader Defendants”), and violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the Individual Defendants. Plaintiffs alleged that the Kader Defendants made material misrepresentations or omissions during the putative class period of April 21, 2014 through October 27, 2014, regarding the sufficiency of the Company’s data for submission of an NDA for eteplirsen and the likelihood of the FDA accepting the NDA based on that data. Plaintiffs sought compensatory damages and fees. The Kader Defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint on May 11, 2015. On April 5, 2016, following oral argument on March 29, 2016, the Court granted Defendants’ motion to dismiss. On April 8, 2016, Lead Plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file an amended complaint, which Defendants opposed. On January 6, 2017, the Court denied Plaintiffs’ motion for leave to amend and dismissed the case. Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal on February 3, 2017. Oral argument took place on December 4, 2017 and the First Circuit affirmed the District Court’s dismissal of this case on April 4, 2018. The period for filing a petition with the U.S. Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari has elapsed without a filing from the plaintiffs. As such, there is no risk of loss in connection with this litigation. On February 5, 2015, a derivative suit was filed in the 215th Judicial District of Harris County, Texas against the Company’s Board of Directors ( David Smith, derivatively on behalf of Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc., v. Christopher Garabedian et al., No. 2015-06645 ). The claims alleged that Sarepta’s directors caused Sarepta to disseminate materially false and/or misleading statements in connection with disclosures concerning the Company’s submission of the NDA for eteplirsen. Plaintiff sought unspecified compensatory damages, actions to reform and improve corporate governance and internal procedures, disgorgement of profits, benefits and other compensation obtained by the directors, and attorneys’ fees. On July 10, 2018, Plaintiff filed a Notice of Nonsuit as to all causes of action asserted in the complaint. On July 11, 2018, the court accepted the Notice of Nonsuit and all causes of action asserted in the complaint were dismissed with prejudice. As such, there is no risk of loss in connection with this litigation. On March 16, 2016, a derivative suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the Company’s Board of Directors ( Dawn Cherry, on behalf of nominal defendant Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc., v. Behrens et al., No. 16-cv-10531 ). The claims alleged that the defendants authorized the Company to make materially false and misleading statements about the Company’s business prospects in connection with its development of eteplirsen from July 10, 2013 through the date of the complaint. Plaintiffs sought unspecified damages, actions to reform and improve corporate governance and internal procedures, and attorneys’ fees. On July 23, 2018, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Voluntary Dismissal and dismissed their claims without prejudice. As such, there is no risk of loss in connection with this litigation. Additionally, on September 23, 2014, a derivative suit was filed against the Company’s Board of Directors with the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware ( Terry McDonald, derivatively on behalf of Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc., et al. v. Goolsbee et al., No. 10157 ). The claims allege, among other things, that (i) the Company’s non-employee directors paid themselves excessive compensation fees for 2013, (ii) that the compensation for the Company’s former Chief Executive Officer, Christopher Garabedian, was also excessive and such fees were the basis for Mr. Garabedian’s not objecting to or stopping the excessive fees for the non-employee directors and (iii) that the disclosure in the 2013 proxy statement was deficient. The relief sought, among others, includes disgorgement and rescindment of allegedly excessive or unfair payments and equity grants to Mr. Garabedian and the directors, unspecified damages plus interest, a declaration that the Company’s Amended and Restated 2011 Equity Plan at the 2013 annual meeting was ineffective and a revote for approved amendments, correction of misleading disclosures and plaintiff’s attorney fees. The F-37 parties agreed to a settlement, which was approved by the Delaware Court of Chancery on September 4, 2018. The Company does not believe that disposition of the McDonald suit will have a material financial impact on the Company. 22. SUBSEQUENT EVENT On February 27, 2019, the Company announced that it exercised the exclusive option to acquire Myonexus as more fully described in Note 3, License and Collaboration Agreements . The final exercise price as negotiated between the Company and Myonexus was $165.0 million. The Company may also be required to make up to $200.0 million in additional payments to the selling shareholders of Myonexus based on the achievement of certain milestones. The Company has evaluated subsequent events from the date of the consolidated balance sheet through the date the consolidated financial statements were issued. 23.

Business Overview Celsius is a fast-growing company in the functional energy drink and liquid supplement categories in the United States and internationally. We engage in the development, processing, marketing, sale, and distribution of functional drinks and liquid supplements to a broad range of consumers. We believe that we provide differentiated products that offer clinically proven and innovative formulas meant to change the lives of our consumers for the better. We also believe that our brand is attractive to a broad range of customers including fitness enthusiasts. Our core offerings include pre- and post-workout functional energy drinks, as well as protein bars. Our flagship functional energy drink and liquid supplement brands are backed by science, being clinically proven to deliver health benefits by six self-funded studies published in various journals including the Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition, the Journal of the American College of Nutrition, and the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research. These studies have concluded that a single serving of CELSIUS ® burns 100-140 calories (by increasing a consumer’s resting metabolism an average of 12%, while providing sustained energy for up to three hours.

On August 1, 2022, the Company and PepsiCo Inc. (“Pepsi”), entered into multiple agreements, including a Securities Purchase Agreement (“Purchase Agreement”), Lock-Up Agreements, Registration Rights Agreement, a distribution agreement (“Distribution Agreement”), and a Channel Transition Agreement (“Transition Agreement”). The Purchase Agreement, Lock-Up Agreements and Registration Rights Agreement pertain to the Company’s issuance of 1,466,666 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series A” or “Series A Preferred Stock”) in exchange for cash proceeds of $550 million, excluding transaction costs. The Transition Agreement specifies payments to be made by Pepsi to Celsius for transitioning certain existing distribution rights to Pepsi. The Distribution Agreement resulted in Pepsi becoming the Company’s primary distribution supplier for the Company’s products in the United States. Potential Effects of new COVID-19 Variants on the Company’s Business The COVID-19 pandemic has presented and continues to present a substantial public health and economic challenge around the world and is affecting our employees, communities and business operations, as well as the global economy and financial markets. The human and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the measures taken or that may be taken in the future by governments, businesses (including the Company and our suppliers, distributors, co-packers and other service providers) and the public at large to limit new variants could directly and indirectly impact our business and results of operations, including, without limitation, the following: 1 Any of the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including those described above, alone or in combination with others, may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and/or financial condition. Any of these negative impacts, alone or in combination with others, could exacerbate many of the risk factors discussed herein, any of which could materially affect our business, reputation, operating results and/or financial condition. Corporate Information We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 26, 2005. The Company’s annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports are made available free of charge through the Company’s website as soon as practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. Our website is www.celsiusholdingsinc.com . Information contained on, or that can be accessed through our website is not incorporated by reference into this Report. 2 Our Products We seek to combine nutritional science with mainstream beverages by using our proprietary thermogenic (calorie-burning) MetaPlus ® formulation, while fostering the goal of healthier everyday refreshment by being as natural as possible without the artificial preservatives often found in many energy drinks or sodas. CELSIUS ® has no chemical preservatives, aspartame or high fructose corn syrup and is very low in sodium. CELSIUS ® uses good-for-you ingredients and supplements such as green tea (EGCG), ginger, calcium, chromium, B vitamins and vitamin C. CELSIUS ® is sweetened with sucralose, a sugar-derived sweetener that is found in Splenda ® , which makes our functional energy drinks low-calorie and suitable for consumers whose sugar intake is restricted. Each 12 ounce can of CELSIUS ® contains 200 milligrams of caffeine which is comparable to one 12-ounce cup of coffee from the leading coffeehouse. CELSIUS ® calorie-burning functional energy drinks were first introduced to the marketplace in 2005. According to multiple clinical studies we funded, a single serving (12 ounce can) of CELSIUS ® burns 100 to 140 calories by increasing a consumer’s metabolism an average of 12% for up to a three-hour period. In addition, these studies have indicated that drinking a single serving of CELSIUS ® prior to exercising may improve cardiovascular health and fitness and enhance the loss of fat and gain of muscle from exercise. We currently have five functional energy drink lines: CELSIUS ® ready-to drink products are packaged in a distinctive 12 ounce sleek can that uses vivid colors in abstract patterns to create a strong on-shelf impact. The cans are sold in various packaging units are designed to provide a clean, crisp and more modern look. In addition to being sugar free, our original ready-to-drink product line is non-GMO, kosher and vegan certified and soy and gluten free. Func Food Group Oyj, a company incorporated under the laws of Finland (“Func Food”) was acquired in October 2019, as a result we acquired the beverages, protein bars, supplements and superfoods marketed and distributed in Finland, Sweden, and Norway. These products are distributed under the FAST, FitFarm and CocoVi brands and which are owned by Func Food. 3 Clinical Studies It is our belief that clinical studies substantiating product claims will become more important as more and more “alternative” beverages are marketed with health claims. CELSIUS ® was one of the first functional energy drinks to be launched along with a clinical study. CELSIUS ® is also one of very few functional energy drinks that has clinical research on the actual product itself. Some functional energy drink and supplement companies that do mention studies backing their claims are referencing independent studies conducted on one or more of the ingredients in the product. We believe that it is important and will become more important over time, to have studies on the actual product. We have funded seven U.S. based clinical studies for CELSIUS ® . Each was conducted by a research organization and each studied the total CELSIUS ® formula. The first study was conducted by the Ohio Research Group of Exercise Science & Sports Nutrition. The remaining studies were conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of the University of Oklahoma. We funded all of the studies and provided CELSIUS ® functional energy drinks for the studies. However, none of our directors, executive officers or principal stockholders is in any way affiliated with either of the two research organizations which conducted the studies. The first study was conducted in 2005 by the Ohio Research Group of Exercise Science & Sports Nutrition www.ohioresearchgroup.com. The Ohio Research Group of Exercise Science & Sports Nutrition is a multidisciplinary clinical research team dedicated to exploring the relationship between exercise, nutrition, dietary supplements and health. This placebo-controlled, double-blind cross-over study compared the effects of CELSIUS ® and the placebo on metabolic rate. Twenty-two participants were randomly assigned to ingest a 12-ounce serving of CELSIUS ® and on a separate day a serving of twelve ounces of Diet Coke ® . All subjects completed both trials using a randomized, counterbalanced design. Randomized means that subjects were selected for each group randomly to ensure that the different treatments were statistically equivalent. Counterbalancing means that individuals in one group drank the placebo on the first day and drank CELSIUS ® on the second day. The other group did the opposite. Counterbalancing is a design method that is used to control “order effects.” In other words, this was done to make sure that the order that subjects were served does not impact the results and analysis. Metabolic rate (via indirect calorimetry, measurements taken from breaths into and out of calorimeter) and substrate oxidation (via respiratory exchange ratios) were measured at baseline (pre-ingestion) and for ten minutes at the end of each hour for three hours post-ingestion. The results showed an average increase of metabolism of twelve percent over the three-hour period, compared to a statistically insignificant change for the control group. Metabolic rate, or metabolism, is the rate at which the body expends energy. This is also referred to as the “caloric burn rate.” Indirect calorimetry calculates heat that living organisms produce from their production of carbon dioxide. It is called “indirect” because the caloric burn rate is calculated from a measurement of oxygen uptake. Direct calorimetry would involve the subject being placed inside the calorimeter for the measurement to determine the heat being produced. Respiratory Exchange Ratio is the ratio oxygen taken in a breath compared to the carbon dioxide breathed out in one breath or exchange. Measuring this ratio can be used for estimating which substrate (fuel such as carbohydrate or fat) is being metabolized or ‘oxidized’ to supply the body with energy. The second study was conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2007. This blinded, placebo-controlled study was conducted on a total of 60 men and women of normal weight. An equal number of participants were separated into two groups to compare one serving (a single 12 ounce can) of CELSIUS ® to a placebo of the same amount. According to the study, those subjects consuming CELSIUS ® burned significantly more calories versus those consuming the placebo, over a three-hour period. The study confirmed that over the three-hour period, subjects consuming a single serving of CELSIUS ® burned 65% more calories than those consuming the placebo drink and burned an average of more than 100 to 140 calories compared to the placebo. These results were statistically significant. The third study, conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2007, extended our second study with the same group of 60 individuals and protocol for 28 days and showed the same statistical significance of increased calorie burn (minimal attenuation). While the University of Oklahoma study did extend for 28 days, more testing would be needed for long term analysis of the CELSIUS ® calorie-burning effects. Also, although these studies were on relatively small numbers of subjects, they have statistically significant results. Additional studies on a larger number and wider range of body compositions can be considered to further the analysis. 4 The fourth study, conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2009, combined CELSIUS ® use with exercise. This ten-week placebo-controlled, randomized and blinded study was conducted on a total of 37 subjects. Participants were randomly assigned into one of two groups: Group 1 consumed one serving of CELSIUS ® per day, and Group 2 consumed one serving of an identically flavored and labeled placebo beverage. Both groups participated in ten weeks of combined aerobic and weight training, following the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines of training for previously sedentary adults. The results showed that consuming a single serving of CELSIUS ® prior to exercising may enhance the positive adaptations of exercise on body composition, cardio-respiratory fitness and endurance performance. According to the preliminary findings, subjects consuming a single serving of CELSIUS ® lost significantly more fat mass and gained significantly more muscle mass than those subjects consuming the placebo — a 93.75% greater loss in fat and 50% greater gain in muscle mass, respectively. The study also confirmed that subjects consuming CELSIUS ® significantly improved measures of cardio-respiratory fitness and the ability to delay the onset of fatigue when exercising to exhaustion. The fifth study was conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2009. This ten-week placebo-controlled, randomized and blinded study was conducted on a total of 27 previously sedentary overweight and obese female subjects. Participants were randomly assigned into groups that consumed identically tasting treatment drinks with exercise or without exercise. All participants consumed one drink, either placebo or CELSIUS ® , per day for 10 weeks. The exercise groups participated in ten weeks of combined aerobic and weight training, following the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines of training for previously sedentary adults. No changes were made to their diet. The results showed that consuming a single serving of CELSIUS ® prior to exercising may improve cardiovascular health and fitness and enhance the positive adaptations of exercise on body composition. According to the preliminary findings, subjects consuming a single serving of CELSIUS ® lost significantly more fat mass and gained significantly more muscle mass when compared to exercise alone — a 46% greater loss in fat, 27% greater gain in muscle mass, respectively. The study also confirmed that subjects consuming CELSIUS ® significantly improved measures of cardio-respiratory fitness — 35% greater endurance performance with significant improvements to lipid profiles — total cholesterol decreases of 5 to 13% and bad LDL cholesterol 12 to 18%. Exercise alone had no effect on blood lipid levels. The sixth study was conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2009. This ten-week placebo-controlled, randomized and blinded study was conducted on a total of 37 previously sedentary male subjects. Participants were randomly assigned into groups that consumed identically tasting treatment drinks with exercise or without exercise. All participants consumed one drink, either placebo or CELSIUS ® , per day for 10 weeks. The exercise groups participated in ten weeks of combined aerobic and weight training, following the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines of training for previously sedentary adults. No changes were made to their diet. The results showed that consuming a single serving of CELSIUS ® prior to exercising may improve cardiovascular health and fitness and enhance the positive adaptations of exercise on body composition. Significantly greater decreases in fat mass and percentage body fat and increases in VO 2 were observed in the subjects that consumed CELSIUS ® before exercise versus those that consumed the placebo before exercise. Mood was not affected. Clinical markers for hepatic, renal, cardiovascular and immune function, as determined by pre-and post-blood work revealed no adverse effects. Our seventh study was conducted by Miami Research Institute in 2010 and demonstrated the efficacy and safety of the powders and the shots. This study allows the Company to make the same structure/function claims as its ready to drink products. Manufacture and Supply of Our Products Our functional energy drinks and supplements are produced by established third party beverage co-packers. A co-packer is a manufacturing plant that provides the service of filling bottles or cans for the brand owner. Utilizing co-packers allows us produce in multiple locations strategically placed throughout the country. We purchase most of the ingredients and all packaging materials. The co-pack facility assembles our products and charges us a fee by the case. The shelf life of CELSIUS ® products is specified as 15 to 18 months. 5 Substantially all of the raw materials used in the preparation, bottling and packaging of our products are purchased by us or by our co-packers in accordance with our specifications. Generally, we obtain the ingredients used in our products from domestic suppliers and some ingredients have several reliable suppliers. The ingredients in CELSIUS ® include green tea (EGCG), ginger (from the root), caffeine, B vitamins, vitamin C, taurine, guarana, chromium, calcium, glucuronolactone, sucralose, natural flavors and natural colorings. We have no major supply contracts with any of our suppliers. For certain ingredients, there are limited suppliers. In case of a supply restriction or interruption from any of the flavor and coloring suppliers, we would have to test and qualify other suppliers, which may disrupt our production schedules. Packaging materials are available from multiple sources in the United States. While the beverage industry has experienced some shortages of cans as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been able to secure adequate supply and have not experienced significant adverse effects from such shortages. We believe that our co-packing arrangements and supply sources are adequate for our present needs. Func Food similarly has its FAST and other products manufactured by independent third parties in the Nordic countries. Distribution Domestic In the United States and elsewhere in North America, CELSIUS ® is sold across many retail segments. They include supermarkets, convenience stores, drug stores, nutritional stores, and mass merchants. We also sell to health clubs, gyms, the military, and e-commerce websites. We distribute our products domestically through direct-store delivery (DSD), distributors as well as sales direct to retailers (DTR). Our products are also sold online through e-commerce platforms such as Amazon and Walmart.com. Pepsi. Distribution Agreement On August 1, 2022, we entered into the Distribution Agreement relating to the sale and distribution of certain of the Company’s beverage products in existing channels and distribution methods in the United States, excluding certain existing customer accounts, sales channels, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands (the “Territory”). Under the Distribution Agreement, the Company granted Pepsi the right to sell and distribute its existing beverage products in existing channels and distribution methods and future beverage products that are added from time to time as licensed products under the Distribution Agreement in defined territories. The Distribution Agreement represents a master service agreement and can be cancelled by either party in accordance with the terms of the Distribution Agreement without cause in the nineteenth year of the term (i.e., 2041), the twenty-ninth year of the term (i.e., 2051) and each ten (10) year period thereafter (i.e., 2061, 2071, etc.) by providing twelve (12) months’ written notice on August 1st of each such year to the other party. Except for a termination by the Company “with cause” or a termination by Pepsi “without cause”, the Company is required to pay Pepsi certain compensation upon a termination as specified in the Distribution Agreement. The Company agreed to provide Pepsi a right of first offer in the event the Company intends to (i) manufacture, distribute or sell products in certain additional countries as specified in the Distribution Agreement or (ii) distribute or sell products in any future channels and distribution methods during the term of the Distribution Agreement. Additionally, pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, the Company and Pepsi agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate and execute with Pepsi a distribution agreement reasonably consistent with the Distribution Agreement for the sale and distribution of the products in Canada, and Pepsi agreed to meet and confer in good faith with the Company regarding the terms and conditions upon which Pepsi may be willing to sell or distribute products, either directly or through local sub-distributors in certain other additional countries. The Distribution Agreement includes other customary provisions, including non-competition covenants in favor of the Company, representations and warranties, indemnification provisions, insurance provisions and confidentiality provisions. In connection with the Distribution Agreement the Company and Pepsi also executed a Channel Transition Agreement, providing for the Company’s transition of certain existing distribution rights in the Territory to Pepsi. 6 International We distribute our products in various foreign regions through regional and country-specific distribution partners. In October 2019, we acquired Func Food, our Nordic distribution partner, who markets both our products as well as other products under its own brands. We market our products in the Asian market through local distributors in Hong Kong and a license agreement with our partner in China, Qifeng Food Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd. (“Qifeng”). While we initially began both local production and preliminary distribution of the CELSIUS ® brand in 2018 through our partnership with Qifeng, effective January 1, 2019, we restructured our China distribution efforts by entering into two separate agreements as it relates to the commercialization of our CELSIUS ® products and a repayment of an investment agreement with Qifeng. Under the license agreement, Qifeng was granted the exclusive license rights to manufacture, market and commercialize CELSIUS ® brand products in China. Qifeng will pay a minimum royalty fee of approximately $6.9 million for the first five years of the term of the agreement, transitioning to a volume-based royalty fee, thereafter and until the licensing agreement is terminated or canceled. Under a separate economic agreement, Qifeng will repay the marketing investments made by CELSIUS ® into the China market through 2018. The repayment, which was formalized via a note receivable from Qifeng, will need to be serviced even if the licensing agreement is cancelled or terminated. With our new partnership with Pepsi, we would expect to utilize the Pepsi system as we develop international expansion plans in future periods. Customer Concentration The following table shows the revenue concentration of our customers accounting for more than 10% of revenue, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020: The following table shows the accounts receivable concentration accounting for more than 10% of accounts receivables, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: Sales and Marketing We believe that one of the keys to success in the beverage industry is differentiation, by making our brands and products visually appealing and distinctive from other beverages on the shelves of retailers. We review our products and packaging on an ongoing basis and, where practical, endeavor to make them different and unique. The labels and graphics for many of our products are refreshed from time to time to maximize their visibility and identification, wherever they may be placed in stores, which we continue to reevaluate from time to time. Where appropriate, we partner with our distributors, or retailers to assist our marketing efforts. 7 Seasonality of Sales As is typical in the functional energy drink and supplement industries, sales of products are seasonal, with the highest sales volumes generally occurring in the second and third fiscal quarters, which correspond to the warmer months of the year in our major markets, albeit with our recent significant growth, we have seen ongoing quarter over quarter growth regardless of the season. Competition We believe that our CELSIUS ® brand products are one of the few functional energy drink and supplement lines whose effectiveness is supported by clinical studies, which gives us a unique position. However, our products do compete broadly with not only functional energy drinks and supplements, but all categories of liquid refreshments. The functional energy drink, supplement and liquid refreshment markets are highly competitive, and include international, national, regional and local producers and distributors, most of whom have greater financial, management and other resources than us. Our direct competitors in the functional energy drink and supplement markets include, but are not limited to The Coca-Cola Company, Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, Nestlé, Waters North America, Inc., Hansen Natural Corp., Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Monster Energy, and Red Bull. Proprietary Rights We have registered the CELSIUS ® and MetaPlus ® trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, as well as a number of additional trademarks. We have and will continue to take appropriate measures, such as entering into confidentiality agreements with our contract packers and ingredient suppliers, to maintain the secrecy and proprietary nature of our MetaPlus ® formulation and product formulas. We maintain our MetaPlus ® formulation and product formulas as trade secrets. We believe that trade secrecy is a preferable method of protection for our formulas as patenting them might require their disclosure. Other than a company that is our outsourced production manager, no single member of the raw material supply chain or our co-packers has access to the complete formula. We consider our trademarks and trade secrets to be of considerable value and importance to our business. No successful challenges to our registered trademarks have arisen and we have no reason to believe that any such challenges will arise in the future. Government Regulation The production, distribution and sale of our products in the United States is subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act , the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 , the Occupational Safety and Health Act , various environmental statutes and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products. California law requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a component listed by California as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects. The law exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products because the law recognizes no generally applicable quantitative thresholds below which a warning is not required. Consequently, even trace amounts of listed components can expose affected products to the prospect of warning labels. Products containing listed substances that occur naturally in the product or that are contributed to the product solely by a municipal water supply are generally exempt from the warning requirement. While none of our products are required to display warnings under this law, we cannot predict whether an important component of any of our products might be added to the California list in the future. We also are unable to predict whether or to what extent a warning under this law would have an impact on costs or sales of our products. The marketing and sale of our products internationally is similarly subject to compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations in those foreign countries where our products are sold. 8 Compliance with Environmental Laws The facilities of our co-packers in the United States are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to air emissions, the use of water resources and recycling. Our operations in other countries are subject to similar federal, state, local and supranational laws and regulations that may be applicable in such countries. Changes in environmental compliance mandates, and any expenditures necessary to comply with such requirements, could adversely affect our financial performance and future growth. Compliance with these provisions has not had, nor do we expect such compliance to have, any material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, net income or competitive position. Container Deposits Measures have been enacted in various localities and states that require that a deposit be charged for certain non-refillable beverage containers. The precise requirements imposed by these measures vary. We are required to collect deposits from our customers and to remit such deposits to the respective jurisdictions based upon the number of cans and bottles of certain carbonated and non-carbonated products sold in such states. Other deposit, recycling or product stewardship proposals have been introduced in certain states and localities and in Congress, and we anticipate that similar legislation or regulations may be proposed in the future at the local, state and federal levels, both in the United States and elsewhere. Human Capital Resources As of December 31, 2022, the Company employs 378 people including its executive officers, in five different countries. This includes 324 employees in the US, 49 in countries within Europe, and 5 in Hong Kong. Employees We believe people are our most important asset, and we strive to attract and retain high-performing talents. Through comprehensive and competitive compensation and benefits, ongoing employee learning and development, and a focus on health and well-being, we strive to support our employees in all aspects of their lives. We believe we have a talented, motivated and dedicated team, and work to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all team members. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion We believe a culture that celebrates diverse talent, individual identity, and different points of view, empowers employees to contribute new ideas that support our continued and growing success. Women, racial and ethnic minorities collectively constitute a meaningful part of our overall workforce across all levels of our global organization. Culture and Engagement We believe open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow, and succeed. Team members are encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns. We also encourage regular, live communication across the organization and host quarterly global town halls with our senior leadership. Leadership, Training and Development We focus on investing in inspirational leadership, learning opportunities and capabilities to equip our global workforce with the skills they need while improving engagement and retention. We provide formal and informal learning programs, which are designed to help our employees continuously grow and strengthen their skills throughout their careers. We offer a variety of programs that contribute to our leadership, training and development goals, and comprehensive coaching and mentoring programs that support leadership and employee development. 9 Compensation and Benefits We believe that compensation should be competitive and equitable and should enable employees to share in the Company’s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, we offer a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world and invest in tools and resources that are designed to support employees’ individual growth and development. Our compensation programs are designed to reinforce our growth agenda and our talent strategy as well as to drive a strong connection between the contributions of our employees and their pay. We conduct annual pay equity analyses to help ensure our base pay structures are fair and to identify and address potential issues or disparities and we adjust base pay, where appropriate. Also, as permitted by local law, annually, we perform an adverse impact analysis on base pay, annual incentives, and long-term incentives to help ensure fairness. We provide compensation packages designed to attract and retain talent while maintaining alignment with the market. We believe the structure of our compensation packages provides the appropriate incentives to attract, retain and motivate our employees. Our base pay aligns with employee positions, skill levels, experience, and geographic location. Additionally, we provide competitive employee benefits packages, which vary by country and region. These employee benefits packages may include: employee assistance programs, medical and dental insurance, vision insurance, well-being rewards programs, core and supplemental life insurance, long and short-term disability, accident insurance, critical illness insurance, retirement savings plans, prepaid legal services, healthy rewards programs, identity theft assistance, financial courses and advisors, vacation pay, holiday pay, annual incentive awards, recognition programs, and equity awards for eligible employees. Our Compensation Committee provides oversight of the our policies and strategies relating to talent, leadership, and culture, including diversity, equity and inclusion, as well as the Company’s compensation philosophy and programs. The Compensation Committee also evaluates and approves our compensation plans, policies and programs applicable to our senior executives. In addition, the Compensation Committee oversees succession planning and talent development for our senior executives. We believe that our approach to human capital resources has been instrumental in our growth, and has made us a desirable destination for employees. Information about our Executive Officers The following is a description of the business experience and background of Jarrod Langhans, our Chief Financial Officer, who is our only executive officer who is not a member of our board of directors. Jarrod Langhans , 42, became our Chief Financial Officer in April 2022. Mr. Langhans served as Chief Financial Officer of the European and Israel operating segments of Primo Water Corporation. From July 2012 through May 2020, he has held various executive positions within Primo Water Corporation across the accounting, finance and investor relations areas. Mr. Langhans’ prior experience also includes working for major accounting firms such as CBIZ Mayer Hoffman McCann (MHM) and Cherry Bekaert. He is a Certified Public Accountant in Florida and has an extensive and diversified financial and leadership background across areas such as financial reporting. Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the other information contained in this Report, including in “ Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ” and the consolidated financial statement and notes, you should carefully consider the following risks. The risks and uncertainties discussed below and elsewhere in this Report may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently see as immaterial, may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects . 10 Risk Factors Relating to Our Business Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by new COVID-19 variants COVID-19 has presented and continues to present a substantial public health and economic challenge around the world and is affecting our employees, communities and business operations, as well as the global economy and financial markets. The human and economic consequences of new COVID-19 variants as well as the measures taken or that may be taken in the future by governments, businesses (including the Company and our suppliers, distributors, co-packers and other service providers) and the public at large to limit the spread of new COVID-19 variants, may directly and indirectly impact our business and results of operations, including, without limitation, the following: 11 Any of the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including those described above, alone or in combination with others, may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and/or financial condition. Any of these negative impacts, alone or in combination with others, could exacerbate many of the risk factors discussed herein, any of which could materially affect our business, reputation, operating results and/or financial condition. Consolidation of retailers, wholesalers and distributors in the industry may result in downward pressure on sales prices. Consolidation can cause significant downward pricing pressure and can impose additional costs on us. If we are unable to successfully manage the potential impact of these commercial changes, our financial results may be materially and adversely affected. We rely on third party co-packers to manufacture our products. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our co-packers and/or their ability to manufacture our products becomes constrained or unavailable to us, our business could suffer. We do not directly manufacture our products, but instead outsource such manufacturing to established third party co-packers. These third-party co-packers may not be able to fulfill our demand as it arises, could begin to charge rates that make using their services cost inefficient or may simply not be able to or willing to provide their services to us on a timely basis or at all. In the event of any disruption or delay, whether caused by a rift in our relationship or the inability of our co-packers to manufacture our products as required, we would need to secure the services of alternative co-packers. We may be unable to procure alternative packing facilities at commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time period and any such transition could be costly. In such case, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. We rely on distributors to distribute our products in the DSD sales channel and in international markets. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing distributors, our business could suffer. We distribute CELSIUS ® in the DSD sales channel by entering into agreements with direct-to-store delivery distributors having established sales, marketing and distribution organizations. We similarly are seeking to expand our international distribution, by entering into agreements with large established distributors who service those markets. Many of our distributors are affiliated with and manufacture and/or distribute other beverage products. In many cases, such products compete directly with our products. The marketing efforts of our distributors are important for our success. If CELSIUS ® proves to be less attractive to our distributors and/or if we fail to attract distributors, and/or our distributors do not market and promote our products with greater focus in preference to the products of our competitors, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Our customers are material to our success. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing customers, our business could suffer. Unilateral decisions could be taken by our distributors, grocery chains, convenience chains, drug stores, nutrition stores, mass merchants, club warehouses and other customers to discontinue carrying all or any of our products that they are carrying at any time, which could cause our business to suffer. 12 Increases in cost or shortages of raw materials or increases in costs of co-packing could harm our business . The principal raw materials used by us are flavors and ingredient blends as well as aluminum cans, the prices of which are subject to fluctuations. We are uncertain whether the prices of any of the above or any other raw materials or ingredients we utilize will rise in the future and whether we will be able to pass any of such increases on to our customers. We do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials. In addition, some of these raw materials, such as our sleek 12 ounce can, are available from a limited number of suppliers. As alternative sources of supply may not be available, any interruption in the supply of such raw materials might materially harm us. While the functional energy drink and supplement industries have experienced some shortages of cans as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Celsius has been able to secure adequate supply, though potentially at higher cost. To address the industry-wide shortage of aluminum cans, we have imported cans manufactured abroad which affected our margins in 2021 and 2022. We are unable to accurately predict how these cost trends might evolve prospectively. Such industry-wide shortages of raw materials, including aluminum cans, could from time to time in the future be encountered, which could interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our products and negatively impact our financial performance. Our failure to accurately estimate demand for our products could adversely affect our business and financial results. We may not correctly estimate demand for our existing products and/or new products. Our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise, particularly with regard to new products, and may be less precise during periods of rapid growth, including in new markets. If we materially underestimate demand for our products or are unable to secure sufficient ingredients, flavors, aluminum cans and other raw materials for our supplements or experience difficulties with our co-packing arrangements, including production shortages or quality issues, we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis. Moreover, industry-wide shortages of certain ingredients have occurred and could occur, from time to time in the future, resulting in production fluctuations and/or product shortages. We generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage this risk. Such shortages could interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. If we do not accurately anticipate the future demand for a particular product or the time it will take to obtain new inventory, our inventory levels may be inadequate and our results of operations may be negatively impacted. If we fail to meet our shipping schedules, we could damage our relationships with distributors and/or retailers, increase our distribution costs and/or cause sales opportunities to be delayed or lost. In order to be able to deliver our products on a timely basis, we need to maintain adequate inventory levels of the desired products. If the inventory of our products held by our distributors and/or retailers is too high, they will not place orders for additional products, which could unfavorably impact our future sales and adversely affect our operating results. Changes in the retail landscape or the loss of key retail or food service customers could adversely affect our financial results. Our industry is being affected by the trend toward consolidation in and blurring of the lines between retail channels, particularly in Europe and the United States. Larger retailers may seek lower prices from us, may demand increased marketing or promotional expenditures, and may be more likely to use their distribution networks to introduce and develop private-label brands, any of which could negatively affect our profitability. In addition, discounters and value stores are growing at a rapid pace. Our industry is also being affected by the rapid growth in sales through e-commerce retailers, e-commerce websites, mobile commerce applications and subscription services, which may result in a shift away from physical retail operations to digital channels. As we build our e-commerce capabilities, we may not be able to develop and maintain successful relationships with existing and new e-commerce retailers without experiencing a deterioration of our relationships with key customers operating physical retail channels. If we are unable to successfully adapt to the rapidly changing retail landscape, including the rapid growth in digital commerce, our share of sales, volume growth and overall financial results could be negatively affected. In addition, our success depends in part on our ability to maintain good relationships with key retail customers. The loss of one or more of our key retail customers could have an adverse effect on our financial performance. 13 Significant additional labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products may inhibit sales of affected products. Various jurisdictions may seek to adopt significant additional product labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products as a result of what our products contain or allegations that our products cause adverse health effects. If these types of requirements become applicable to one or more of our products under current or future environmental or health laws or regulations, they may inhibit sales of such products. For example, under one such law in California, known as Proposition 65, if the state has determined that a substance causes cancer or harms human reproduction, a warning must be provided for any product sold in the state that exposes consumers to that substance, unless the exposure falls under an established safe harbor level or another exemption is applicable. If we were required to add Proposition 65 warnings on the labels of one or more of our supplement products produced for sale in California, the resulting consumer reaction to the warnings and possible adverse publicity could negatively affect our sales both in California and in other markets. Our continued expansion outside of the United States exposes us to uncertain conditions and other risks in international markets. We have sales of products internationally in a variety of markets and are currently seeking to expand our international distribution. As our growth strategy includes further expanding our international business, if we are unable to continue to expand distribution of our products outside the United States, our growth rate could be adversely affected. Although we intend to sell through established distributors in international markets, we have limited or no operating experience in many of such markets and it may be costly to promote our brands in international markets. We face and will continue to face substantial risks associated with foreign distribution and sale of our products, including economic and/or political instability in various international markets; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; restrictions on or costs relating to the repatriation of foreign profits to the United States, including possible taxes and/or withholding obligations on any repatriations; and tariffs and/or trade restrictions. These risks could have a significant impact on our ability to distribute and sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, distribution and sale of products outside of the United States are subject to risks relating to appropriate compliance with legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions, potentially higher product damage rates if our products are shipped long distances, potentially higher incidence of fraud and/or corruption, credit risk of distributors and potentially adverse tax consequences. Numerous U.S. and International laws including export and import controls affect our ability to compete in international markets. U.S. export control laws and economic and trade sanctions prohibit the provision of certain products and services to U.S. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments and persons. Even though we take precautions to prevent our products from being shipped or provided to embargoed countries and U.S. sanctions targets, they could be shipped, or provided by our distributors, to those countries and targets despite such precautions. The provision of goods in violation of U.S. export controls and/or sanctions could have negative consequences for our business, including government investigations, penalties and reputational harm. We must also comply with U.S. import laws. U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) also impact our international activities. We are subject to the FCPA and other laws that prohibit improper payments and offers to foreign officials and political parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Selling products into international markets, including through distributors, creates the risk of unauthorized payments or offers, for which we may be held responsible. Violations of the FCPA or other applicable anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, or other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Changes in export and import regulations, economic sanctions and related laws, shifts in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, changes in the countries, governments or persons targeted by such regulations and the imposition of tariffs may create delays in the introduction and sale of our products in international markets, result in decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations or in some cases, prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries, governments or persons. Actions taken with respect to tariffs or trade relations between the United States and other countries, the products subject to such actions, and actions taken by other countries in retaliation may also have an adverse impact on us. The failure to comply with applicable current or future U.S. import, export control, sanctions and anti-corruption laws, including U.S. Customs regulations, could expose us and our employees to substantial civil or criminal penalties, fines and in extreme cases, incarceration. In addition, if our distributors fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re-export licenses or authorizations, or otherwise act in accordance with applicable laws, we may be adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties. 14 Failure to successfully complete or manage strategic transactions can adversely affect our business We regularly review our portfolio of businesses and evaluate potential acquisitions, joint ventures, distribution agreements, divestitures, and other strategic transactions. The success of these transactions, including the recent completion of the strategic transaction with Pepsi, is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to realize the full extent of the expected returns, benefits, cost savings or synergies as a result of a transaction, within the anticipated time frame, or at all; and receipt of necessary consents, clearances and approvals. Risks associated with strategic transactions include integrating manufacturing, distribution, sales, accounting, financial reporting and administrative support activities and information technology systems with our company or difficulties separating such personnel, activities and systems in connection with divestitures; operating through new business models or in new categories or territories; motivating, recruiting and retaining executives and key employees; conforming controls (including internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures) and policies (including with respect to environmental compliance, health and safety compliance and compliance with anti-bribery laws); retaining existing customers and consumers and attracting new customers and consumers; managing tax costs or inefficiencies; maintaining good relations with divested or refranchised businesses in our supply or sales chain; inability to offset loss of revenue associated with divested brands or businesses; managing the impact of business decisions or other actions or omissions of our joint venture partners that may have different interests than we do; and other unanticipated problems or liabilities, such as contingent liabilities and litigation. Strategic transactions that are not successfully completed or managed effectively, or our failure to effectively manage the risks associated with such transactions, could continue to result in adverse effects on our business. If we fail to realize a significant portion of the anticipated benefits of our strategic arrangement with Pepsi, our financial results could be adversely affected. We have a long-term strategic distribution arrangement with Pepsi. If we are unable to successfully manage our relationship with Pepsi, or if for any other reason we fail to realize all or a significant part of the benefits we expect from this strategic relationship, our financial performance could be adversely affected. Global or regional catastrophic events could impact our operations and affect our ability to grow our business. Because of our increasingly global presence, our business could be affected by unstable political conditions, civil unrest, protests and demonstrations, large-scale terrorist acts, especially those directed against the United States or other major industrialized countries where our products are distributed, the outbreak or escalation of armed hostilities, such as the Russian conflict in the Ukraine, major natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, wildfires, tornadoes, earthquakes or floods, or widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases (such as the COVID-19 pandemic). Such catastrophic events could impact our operations and our supply chain, including the production and/or distribution of our products. Materials and/or personnel may need to mobilize to other locations. Our headquarters and a large part of our operations are located in Florida, a state at greater risk of hurricanes. Some of the raw materials we use, including certain sizes of cans, are available from limited suppliers, and a regional catastrophic event impacting such suppliers could adversely impact our operations. In addition, such events could disrupt global or regional economic activity, which could affect consumer purchasing power and consumers’ ability to purchase our products, thereby reducing demand for our products. If our operations are disrupted or we are unable to grow our business as a result of these factors, our growth rate could decline and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Climate change and natural disasters may affect our business. There is concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures due to increased carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. Changing weather patterns could result in decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions, and/or outbreaks of diseases or other health issues, which may limit availability and/or increase the cost of certain ingredients used in our products and could impact the food security of communities around the world. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain and/or impact demand for our products. 15 Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, wildfires, earthquakes or floods, and outbreaks of diseases (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or other health issues may affect our operations and the operation of our supply chain, impact the operations of our distributors and unfavorably impact our consumers’ ability to purchase our products. In addition, public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy, transportation and raw material costs, and may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment. Changes in applicable laws, regulations, standards or practices related to greenhouse gas emissions, packaging and water scarcity, as well as initiatives by advocacy groups in favor of certain climate change-related laws, regulations, standards or practices, may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures and other financial obligations, which could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Sales of our products may also be influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate. Our third-party co-packers use a number of key ingredients in the manufacture of our liquid supplement products and powder packets that are derived from agricultural commodities. Increased demand for food products and decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions of the world as a result of changing weather patterns and other factors may limit the availability or increase the cost of such agricultural commodities and could impact the food security of communities around the world. Weather conditions may influence consumer demand for certain of our supplements, which could have an effect on our operations, either positively or negatively. We depend upon our trademarks and proprietary rights, and any failure to protect our intellectual property rights or any claims that we are infringing upon the rights of others may adversely affect our competitive position. Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to protect our current and future brands and products and to defend our intellectual property rights. We cannot be sure that trademarks will be issued with respect to any future trademark applications or that our competitors will not challenge, invalidate or circumvent any existing or future trademarks issued to, or licensed by, us. Our products are manufactured using our proprietary blends of ingredients. These blends are created by third-party suppliers to our specifications and then supplied to our co-packers. Although all of the third parties in our supply and manufacture chain execute confidentiality agreements, there can be no assurance that our trade secrets, including our proprietary ingredient blends will not become known to competitors. We believe that our competitors, many of whom are more established and have greater financial and personnel resources than we do, may be able to replicate or reverse engineer our processes, brands, flavors, or our products in a manner that could circumvent our protective safeguards. Therefore, we cannot give you any assurance that our confidential business information will remain proprietary. Any such loss of confidentiality could diminish or eliminate any competitive advantage provided by our proprietary information. We must continually maintain, protect and/or upgrade our information technology systems, including protecting us from internal and external cyber-security threats. Information technology enables us to operate efficiently, interface with customers, maintain financial accuracy and efficiency and accurately produce our financial statements. If we do not appropriately allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, and/or the loss of and/or damage to intellectual property through security breaches, including internal and external cyber-security threats. Cyber-security attacks by hackers, criminal groups or nation-state organizations are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software (malware, ransomware and viruses), phishing and social engineering, cyber extortion, attempts to gain unauthorized access to networks, computer systems and data, malicious or negligent actions of employees (including misuse of information they are entitled to access) and other forms of electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in business systems, an inability to process customer orders and/or lost customer orders, unauthorized access, destruction, loss, alteration, falsification, unavailability or release of material confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. Such cyberattacks could result in violations of data protection laws and regulations, damage to the reputation and credibility of the Company, loss of opportunities to acquire or divest of businesses, and loss of ability to commercialize products developed through research and development efforts and, therefore, could have a negative impact on net operating revenues. 16 We rely on relationships with third parties, including suppliers, distributors, co-packers, contractors, cloud data storage and other information technology service providers and other external business partners, for certain functions or for services in support of our operations. These third-party service providers, and partners, with whom we may share data including without limitation, for data hosting, back-office support, and other functions, are subject to similar risks as we are relating to cyber-security, privacy violations, business interruption, and systems, as well as employee failures. While we have procedures in place for selecting and managing our relationships with third-party service providers and other business partners, we do not have control over their business operations or governance and compliance systems, practices and procedures, which increases our financial, legal, reputational and operational risk. These third parties may experience cyber-security incidents that may involve data we share with them or rely on them to provide to us, and the need to coordinate with such third-parties, including with respect to timely notification and access to personnel and information concerning an incident, may complicate our efforts to resolve any issues that arise. We believe that we have adopted appropriate measures including but not limited to ongoing cyber-security risk assessments and business continuity measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology and our operations from these information technology-related disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to operational interruption, damage to our brand image and private data exposure. We could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a cyber-security attack or to repair or replace networks and information systems. Moreover, if our data management systems do not effectively collect, store, process and report relevant data for the operation of our business (whether due to network or equipment malfunction or constraints, software deficiencies, cyber-security attack and/or human error), our ability to effectively plan, forecast and execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations will be impaired, perhaps materially. Any such impairment could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the timeliness with which we report our internal and external operating results. While we have purchased cyber-security insurance, there are no assurances that the coverage would be adequate in relation to any incurred losses. Moreover, as cyber-security attacks and increase in frequency and magnitude, we may be unable to obtain cyber-security insurance in amounts and on terms we view as appropriate for our operations. If we fail to comply with data privacy and personal data protection laws, we could be subject to adverse publicity, government enforcement actions and/or private litigation, which may negatively impact our business and operating results. We receive, process, transmit and store information relating to certain identified or identifiable individuals (“personal data”), including current and former employees, in the ordinary course of business. As a result, we are subject to various U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations relating to personal data. These laws are subject to change, and new personal data legislation may be enacted in other jurisdictions at any time. In the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) became effective in May 2018 for all member states. The GDPR includes operational requirements for companies receiving or processing personal data of residents of the European Union different from those that were previously in place and also includes significant penalties for noncompliance. Additionally, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”), which was enacted in June 2018 and came into effect on January 1, 2020, provides a new private right of action and statutory damages for certain data breaches and imposes operational requirements on companies that process personal data of California residents, including making new disclosures to consumers, employees and B2B contacts about data collection, processing and sharing practices and allowing consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties. Other states have, or may, adopt similar such requirements and regulations. Changes introduced by the GDPR and the CCPA, as well as other changes to existing personal data protection laws and the introduction of such laws in other jurisdictions, and changes to regulation, industry standards and contractual obligations, subject the Company to, among other things, additional costs and expenses and may require costly changes to our business practices and security systems, policies, procedures and practices. The interpretation and application of these laws and regulations are often uncertain and evolving; as a result, there can be no assurance that our data protection measures will be deemed adequate by a regulator or court. There can be no assurances that our security controls over personal data, training of personnel on data privacy and data security, vendor management processes, and the policies, procedures and practices we implement will prevent the improper processing or breaches of personal data. Data breaches or improper processing, or breaches of personal data in violation of the GDPR, the CCPA and/or of other personal data protection or privacy laws and regulations, could harm our reputation, cause loss of consumer confidence, subject us to government enforcement actions (including fines), and mandatory corrective action, or result in private litigation against us, which may result in potential loss of revenue, increased costs, liability for monetary damages or fines and/or criminal prosecution, thereby negatively impacting our business and operating results. 17 If we fail to manage future growth effectively, our business could be materially adversely affected. We have experienced rapid growth and anticipate such growth may continue. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we grew from 225 to 378 employees, and expect to continue expanding our hiring and marketing efforts with no assurance that our business or revenue will continue to grow. This growth may place significant demands on management and our operational infrastructure. As we continue to grow, we must manage such growth effectively by successfully integrating, developing and motivating a large number of new employees, while maintaining the beneficial aspects of our company culture. If we do not manage the growth of our business and operations effectively, the quality of our products and efficiency of our operations could suffer and we may not be able to execute on our business plan, which could harm our brand, results of operations and overall business. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that we will achieve our planned growth, or even if we are able to grow as planned, that we will continue to sustain such growth or performance. We may incur material losses as a result of product recall and product liability . We may be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury, illness or death. We also may be required to recall some of our products if they become contaminated or are damaged or mislabeled. A significant product liability judgment against us, or a widespread product recall, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The amount of the insurance we carry is limited, and that insurance is subject to certain exclusions and may or may not be adequate. We rely on our management team and other key personnel. We depend on the skills, experience, relationships, and continued services of key personnel, including our experienced management team. In addition, our ability to achieve our operating goals also depends on our ability to recruit, train, and retain qualified individuals. We compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel, and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract and retain additional talented personnel. Any such loss or failure could adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results. In particular, our continued success will depend in part, on our ability to retain the talents and dedication of key employees. Our business may be adversely affected, and our management team may be distracted as a result of new COVID-19 variants. Furthermore, we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any of our key employees who leave or be able to offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms, all of which could adversely affect our procurement and distribution processes, sales and marketing activities, financial processes & condition and results of operations. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) has not passed on the efficacy of our products or the accuracy of any claim we make related to our products. Although seven independent clinical studies have been conducted relating to the calorie-burning and related effects of our products, the results of these studies have not been submitted to or reviewed by the FDA. Further, the FDA has not passed on the efficacy of any of our products nor has it reviewed or passed on any claims we make related to our products, including the claim that our products aid consumers in burning calories or enhancing their metabolism. The Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) regulates advertising and may review the truthfulness of and substantiation for any claim we make related to our products. Our advertising activities are subject to regulation by the FTC under the Federal Trade Commission Act. In recent years, the FTC and state attorneys general have initiated numerous investigations of dietary and nutritional supplement companies and products. Any actions or investigations initiated against the Company by governmental authorities or private litigants could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The shifting regulatory environment through the various jurisdictions in which are products are sold necessitates building and maintaining robust systems to achieve and maintain compliance in multiple jurisdictions and increases the possibility that we may violate one or more of the legal requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any applicable laws or regulations, we may be subject to, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, injunctions, or product withdrawals, recalls or seizures, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, our financial condition and results of operations. 18 Risk Factors Relating to Our Industry We are subject to significant competition in the functional energy drink and supplement industries. The functional energy drink and supplement industries are highly competitive. The principal areas of competition are pricing, packaging, distribution channel penetration, development of new products and flavors and marketing campaigns. Our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of manufacturers, most of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution resources and name recognition than we do. Important factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include the taste and flavor of our products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective development of new, unique cutting-edge products, attractive and different packaging, branded product advertising and pricing. Our products compete with all liquid refreshments and with products of much larger and substantially better financed competitors, including the products of numerous nationally and internationally known producers, such as The Coca Cola Company, Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, Nestlé, Waters North America, Inc., Hansen Natural Corp., Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Monster Energy and Red Bull. We also compete with companies that are smaller or primarily local in operation. Our products also compete with private label brands such as those carried by supermarket chains, convenience store chains, drug store chains, mass merchants and club warehouses. New competitors continue to emerge, some of which target specific markets of ours as well as the health and wellness space. This may require additional marketing expenditures on our part to remain competitive. The rapid growth in sales through e-commerce retailers, e-commerce websites, mobile commerce applications and subscription services, may result in a shift away from physical retail operations to digital channels and a reduction in impulse purchases. Further, the ability of consumers to compare prices on a real-time basis using digital technology puts additional pressure on us to maintain competitive prices. Sales in gas chains may also be affected by improvements in fuel efficiency and increased consumer preferences for electric or alternative fuel-powered vehicles, which may result in fewer trips by consumers to gas stations and a corresponding reduction in purchases by consumers in convenience gas retailers. We have been growing our e-commerce sales by using Amazon and leveraging our retail partners e-commerce platforms, rather than building our own internal platform. However, if we are unable to successfully adapt to the rapidly changing retail landscape, our share of sales, volume growth and overall financial results could be negatively affected. Due to competition in the functional energy drink and supplement industries, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter difficulties in maintaining our current revenues, market share or position in the functional energy drink and supplement industries. If our revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Our inability to innovate successfully and to provide new cutting-edge products could adversely affect our business and financial results. Our ability to compete in the highly competitive functional energy drink and supplement industries and to achieve our business growth objectives depends, in part, on our ability to develop new flavors, products and packaging. The success of our innovation, in turn, depends on our ability to identify consumer trends and cater to consumer preferences. If we are not successful in our innovation activities, our business, financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected. Changes in consumer product and shopping preferences may reduce demand for some of our products. The functional energy drink and supplement categories are subject to changing consumer preferences and shifts in consumer preferences may adversely affect us. There is increasing awareness of and concern for health, wellness and nutrition considerations, including concerns regarding caloric intake associated with sugar-sweetened drinks and the perceived undesirability of artificial ingredients. Our products do not contain the artificial preservatives often found in many energy drinks and sodas. CELSIUS ® has no aspartame or high fructose corn syrup and is very low in sodium. The main CELSIUS ® line of products are sweetened with sucralose, a sugar-derived sweetener that is found in Splenda ® , which makes our liquid supplements low-calorie. However, consumer preferences may shift away from the trend towards healthier options that we have observed, and as such, there can be no assurance that our current products and product lines will maintain their current levels of demand. There are also changes in demand for different packages, sizes and configurations. This may reduce demand for our functional energy drinks and liquid supplements, which could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our results of operations. 19 Consumers are seeking greater variety in their functional energy drinks and supplements. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative drinks and supplements that appeal to consumers. In order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative supplements and be competitive in the areas of efficacy, taste, quality and price, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. There is no assurance that consumers will continue to purchase our products in the future. Product lifecycles for some functional energy drink and supplement brands, products and/or packages may be limited to a few years before consumers’ preferences change. The functional energy drink and supplements we currently market are in varying stages of their product lifecycles, and there can be no assurance that such products will become or remain profitable for us. We may be unable to achieve volume growth through product and packaging initiatives. We may also be unable to penetrate new markets. Additionally, as shopping patterns are being affected by the digital evolution, with consumers embracing shopping by way of mobile device applications, e-commerce retailers and e-commerce websites or platforms, we may be unable to address or anticipate changes in consumer shopping preferences or engage with our consumers on their preferred platforms. If our revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We derive virtually all of our revenues from functional energy drinks and supplements, and competitive pressure in the functional energy drink and supplement category could adversely affect our business and operating results. Our focus is in the functional energy drink and supplement categories, and our business is vulnerable to adverse changes impacting the fitness supplement category and business, which could adversely impact our business and the trading price of our common stock. Virtually all of our sales are derived from our functional energy drink and supplements, including our CELSIUS ® Originals and Vibe, CELSIUS HEAT, CELSIUS BCCA+ENERGY, CELSIUS ® On-the-Go and CELSIUS ® product lines. Any decrease in the sales of our functional energy drinks and supplements could significantly adversely affect our future revenues and net income. Historically, we have experienced substantial competition from new entrants in the functional energy drink and supplement categories. The increasing number of competitive products and limited amount of shelf space, including in coolers, in retail stores may adversely impact our ability to gain or maintain our share of sales in the marketplace. In addition, certain actions of our competitors, including unsubstantiated and/or misleading claims, false advertising claims and tortious interference in our business, as well as competitors selling misbranded products, could impact our sales. Competitive pressures in the functional energy drink and supplement categories could impact our revenues, cause price erosion and/or lower market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We compete in an industry that is brand-conscious, so brand name recognition and acceptance of our products are critical to our success and significant marketing and advertising could be needed to achieve and sustain brand recognition. Our business is substantially dependent upon awareness and market acceptance of our products and brands by our targeted consumers. Our business depends on acceptance by our independent distributors of our brand as one that has the potential to provide incremental sales growth rather than reduce distributors’ existing beverage sales. The development of brand awareness and market acceptance is likely to require significant marketing and advertising expenditures. There can be no assurance that CELSIUS ® will achieve and maintain satisfactory levels of acceptance by independent distributors and retail consumers. Any failure of the CELSIUS ® brand to maintain or increase acceptance or market penetration would likely have a material adverse effect on business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to successfully manage new product launches, our business and financial results could be adversely affected. Due to the highly competitive nature of the global functional energy drink and supplement sectors, we expect and intend to continue to introduce new products and evolve existing products to better match consumer demand. The success of new and evolved products depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development and consumer acceptance. Such endeavors may also involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return on capital, exposure to additional regulations and reliance on the performance of third parties. Our sales are affected by seasonality. As is typical in the “alternative” beverage category, our sales are seasonal, albeit with our recent significant growth, we have seen ongoing quarter over quarter growth regardless of the season. Our highest sales volumes generally occur in the second and third quarters, which correspond to the warmer months of the year in our major markets. Consumer demand for our products is also affected by weather conditions. Cool, wet spring or summer weather could result in decreased sales of our products and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 20 Our business is subject to many regulations and noncompliance is costly . The production, marketing and sale of our functional energy drinks and supplements are subject to the rules and regulations of various federal, state and local health agencies. The marketing and sale of our products internationally is similarly subject to compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations in those foreign countries where our products are sold. If a regulatory authority finds that a current or future product or production run is not in compliance with any of these regulations, we may be fined, or production may be stopped, thus adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, any adverse publicity associated with any noncompliance may damage our reputation and our ability to successfully market our products. Furthermore, the rules and regulations are subject to change from time to time and while we closely monitor developments in this area, we have no way of anticipating whether changes in these rules and regulations will impact our business adversely. Additional or revised regulatory requirements, whether labeling, environmental, tax or otherwise, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Product safety and quality concerns, or other negative publicity (whether or not warranted) could damage our brand image and corporate reputation and may cause our business to suffer. Our success depends in large part on our ability to maintain consumer confidence in the safety and quality of all of our products. We have rigorous product safety and quality standards, which we expect our operations as well as our suppliers to meet. However, despite our strong commitment to product safety and quality, we or our suppliers may not always meet these standards, particularly as we expand our product offerings through innovation or acquisitions into product categories that are beyond our traditional range of functional energy drinks and supplements. If we or our suppliers fail to comply with applicable product safety and quality standards, or if our supplement products taken to the market are or become contaminated or adulterated by any means, we may be required to conduct costly product recalls and may become subject to product liability claims and negative publicity, which could cause our business to suffer. Our success also depends on our ability to build and maintain the brand image for our existing products, new products and brand extensions and maintain our corporate reputation. There can be no assurance that our advertising, marketing and promotional programs and our commitment to product safety and quality, human rights and environmental sustainability will have the desired impact on our products’ brand image and on consumer preferences and demand. Claims regarding product safety, quality and/or ingredient content issues, efficacy or lack thereof (real or imagined), our culture and our workforce, our environmental impact and the sustainability of our operations, or allegations of product contamination, even if false or unfounded, could tarnish the image of our brands and may cause consumers to choose other products. Consumer demand for our products could diminish significantly if we, our employees, distributors, suppliers or business partners fail to preserve the quality of our products, act or are perceived to act in an unethical, illegal, discriminatory, unequal or socially irresponsible manner, including with respect to the sourcing, content or sale of our products, service and treatment of our customers, or the use of customer data. Furthermore, our brand image or perceived product quality could be adversely affected by litigation, unfavorable reports in the media (internet or elsewhere), studies in general and regulatory or other governmental inquiries (in each case whether involving our products or those of our competitors) and proposed or new legislation affecting our industry. Negative postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company or any one of our brands, even if inaccurate or malicious, could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the Company. Business incidents, whether isolated or recurring and whether originating from us, our distributors, suppliers or business partners, that erode consumer trust can significantly reduce brand value or potentially trigger boycotts of our products and can have a negative impact on consumer demand for our products as well as our reputation and financial results. The impact of such incidents may be exacerbated if they receive considerable publicity, including rapidly through social or digital media (including for malicious reasons) or result in litigation. In addition, from time to time, there are public policy endeavors that are either directly related to our products and packaging or to our business. These public policy debates can occasionally be the subject of backlash from advocacy groups that have a differing point of view and could result in adverse media and consumer reaction, including product boycotts. Similarly, our sponsorship relationships could subject us to negative publicity as a result of actual or alleged misconduct by individuals or entities associated with organizations we sponsor or support. Likewise, campaigns by activists connecting us, or our supply chain, with human and workplace rights, environmental or animal rights issues could adversely impact our corporate image and reputation. Allegations, even if untrue, that we are not respecting the human rights found in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights; actual or perceived failure by our suppliers or other business partners to comply with applicable labor and workplace rights laws, including child labor laws, or their actual or perceived abuse or misuse of migrant workers; adverse publicity surrounding obesity and health concerns related to our products, our environmental impact and the sustainability of our operations, labor relations, our culture and our workforce or the like could negatively affect our Company’s overall reputation and brand image, which in turn could have a negative impact on our products’ acceptance by consumers. 21 Litigation could expose us to significant liabilities and reduce demand for our products. We have been and are a party, from time to time, to various litigation claims and legal proceedings, including, but not limited to, intellectual property, false advertising, product liability, breach of contract claims and others. Other lawsuits have been filed against us claiming that certain statements made in our advertisements and/or on the labels of our products were false and/or misleading or otherwise not in compliance with food standards under local law. Putative class action lawsuits have also been filed against us, alleging that certain claims in our marketing promotional amount to false advertising. We do not believe any statements made by us in our promotional materials or set forth on our product labels are false or misleading or noncompliant with local law, and we have been defending, and will continue to vigorously defend such lawsuits. At times, even if the Company believes that it is acting in compliance with the law, management may choose to settle claims in order to avoid lengthy trials or disruptions to its business. Any of the foregoing matters or other litigation, the threat thereof, or unfavorable media attention arising from pending or threatened litigation could consume significant financial and managerial resources and result in diminished operational efficiency of the Company, significant monetary awards against us, an injunction barring the sale of any of our products and injury to our reputation. Our failure to successfully defend or settle any litigation or legal proceedings could result in liabilities that, to the extent not covered by our insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenue and profitability, and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline. If we do not maintain an effective internal control environment as well as adequate control procedures over our financial reporting, investor confidence may be adversely affected thereby affecting the value of our stock price. The Company has identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting that, if not remediated, could result in additional material misstatements in its consolidated financial statements. We are required to maintain proper internal control over our financial reporting and adequate controls related to our disclosures. As defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. If we fail to maintain adequate controls, our business, the results of operations, financial condition and/or the value of our stock may be adversely impacted. As described in Part II, Item 9A — Controls and Procedures, management identified material weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting in 2021 and 2022. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The Company is in the process of remediating the material weaknesses. If the Company’s remediation efforts are insufficient or if additional material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, the Company’s consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and it could be required to revise or restate its financial results, which could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, restrict its ability to access the capital markets, require it to expend significant resources to correct the material weakness, subject it to fines, penalties or judgments, harm its reputation or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence. We face investigation from the SEC, the timeline for which and the results of which are currently unknown. On January 8, 2021, we received a letter from the SEC Division of Enforcement seeking the production of documents in connection with a non-public fact-finding inquiry by the SEC to determine whether violations of the federal securities laws have occurred. On August 20, 2021, the SEC issued a subpoena for production of documents in connection with the matter. Neither the January 8, 2021 SEC letter nor the August 20, 2021 subpoena means that the SEC has concluded that the Company or anyone else has violated the federal securities laws. We have cooperated and will continue to cooperate with the SEC staff in its investigation. At this time, however, we cannot predict the length, scope, or results of the investigation or the impact, if any, of the investigation on our results of operations. We may also be subject to further or other examinations, investigations, proceedings and orders by the SEC or other regulators. Any such further or other actions could be expensive and damaging to our business, results of operations and financial condition. 22 Risk Factors Related to Financial Risks Fluctuations in our effective tax rate could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to income and other taxes in both the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. Therefore, we are subject to audits for multiple tax years in various jurisdictions at once. Our 2019 through 2021 U.S. federal income tax returns are subject to examination by the IRS. Our state income tax returns are subject to examination for the 2018 through 2021 tax years. At any given time, events may occur which change our expectation about how any such tax audits will be resolved and thus, there could be significant variability in our quarterly and/or annual tax rates, because these events may change our plans for uncertain tax positions. Changes in U.S. tax laws as a result of any legislation proposed by the new U.S. Presidential Administration or U.S. Congress, which may include efforts to change or repeal the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the federal corporate income tax rate reduction, could adversely affect our provision for income taxes, resulting in an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, changes in the manner in which U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings, including changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. For example, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) has recommended changes to numerous long-standing international tax principles through its base erosion and profit shifting (“BEPS”) project. These changes, to the extent adopted, may increase tax uncertainty, result in higher compliance costs and adversely affect our provision for income taxes, results of operations and/or cash flow. In connection with the OECD’s BEPS project, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in various countries. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in jurisdictions in which we operate, or the adoption of new or reformed tax legislation or regulation, may make resolving tax disputes more difficult and the final resolution of tax audits and any related litigation could differ from our historical provisions and accruals, resulting in an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We may be required in the future to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired. Under United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”), we are required to review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable include, declining or slower than anticipated growth rates for certain of our existing products, a decline in stock price and market capitalization, and slower growth rates in our industry. We may be required in the future to record a significant charge to earnings during the period in which we determine that our intangible assets have been impaired. Any such charge would adversely impact our results of operations. As of December 31, 2022, our goodwill totaled approximately $13.7 million and intangible assets totaled approximately $12.3 million. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our operating results. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, expenses, profits, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, our reported earnings may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Moreover, any favorable impacts to profit margins or financial results from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are likely to be unsustainable over time. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, aggregate foreign currency transaction (losses) gains, resulted in a loss of $2.5 million, and gains of $0.8 million and $0.6 million, respectively. 23 Potential changes in accounting standards or practices and/or taxation may adversely affect our financial results. We cannot predict the impact that future changes in accounting standards or practices may have on our financial results. New accounting standards could be issued that change the way we record revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. These changes in accounting standards could adversely affect our reported earnings. Increases in direct and indirect income tax rates could affect after-tax income. Equally, increases in indirect taxes (including environmental taxes pertaining to the disposal of beverage containers and/or indirect taxes on beverages generally or energy drinks in particular) could affect our products’ affordability and reduce our sales. If we fail to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting on a consolidated basis, our stock price and investor confidence in the Company could be materially and adversely affected. We are required to maintain both disclosure controls and procedures as well as internal control over financial reporting that are effective for the purposes described in “Part II, Item 9A – Controls and Procedures.” If we fail to maintain such controls and procedures, our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or the value of our stock could be materially harmed. Uncertainty in the financial markets and other adverse changes in general economic or political conditions in any of the major countries in which we do business could adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations. Global economic uncertainties, including highly inflationary economies and foreign currency exchange rates, affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways, making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. There can be no assurance that economic improvements will occur, or that they would be sustainable, or that they would enhance conditions in markets relevant to us. In addition, we cannot predict the duration and severity of disruptions in any of our markets or the impact they may have on our customers or business, as our expansion outside of the United States has increased our exposure to any developments or crises in African, Asian, European and other international markets. Unfavorable economic conditions and financial uncertainties in our major international markets and unstable political conditions, including civil unrest and governmental changes, in certain of our other international markets could undermine global consumer confidence and reduce consumers’ purchasing power, thereby reducing demand for our products. Included in the foregoing are long-term uncertainties surrounding the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union on January 31, 2020 (commonly referred to as “Brexit”) and any resulting increases in tariffs, importation restrictions, out of stocks, volatility in currency exchange rates, including the valuation of the euro and the British pound in particular, changes in the laws and regulations applied in the United Kingdom or impacts on economic and market conditions in the United Kingdom, the European Union and its member states and elsewhere. Volatility of stock price may restrict sale opportunities. Our stock price is affected by a number of factors, including stockholder expectations, financial results, the introduction of new products by us and our competitors, general economic and market conditions such as inflation, estimates and projections by the investment community and public comments by other parties as well as many other factors including litigation, many of which are beyond our control. We do not provide guidance on our future performance, including, but not limited to, our revenues, margins, product mix, operating expenses or net income. We may be unable to achieve analysts’ net revenue and/or earnings forecasts, which are based on their own projected revenues, sales volumes and sales mix of many product types and/or new products, certain of which are more profitable than others, as well as their own estimates of gross margin and operating expenses. There can be no assurance that we will achieve any such projected levels or mix of product sales, revenues, gross margins, operating profits and/or net income. As a result, our stock price is subject to significant volatility, and stockholders may not be able to sell our stock at attractive prices. In addition, periods of volatility in the market price of our stock could result in the initiation of securities class action litigation against us. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, the high of our stock price was $122.24 and the low was $38.31. Our investments are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments. On December 31, 2022, we had $652.9 million in cash and cash equivalents. Certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. These risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. 24 Risk Factors Related to our Common Stock We cannot guarantee the continued existence of an active established public trading market for our common stock. Our common stock currently is listed for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Trading in stock quoted on the Nasdaq Capital Market may often experience wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance. Market prices for our common stock may also be influenced by a number of other factors, including: Our board of directors has the authority, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with terms that may not be beneficial to common stockholders and with the ability to affect adversely stockholder voting power and perpetuate their control over us. We have outstanding shares of preferred stock with rights and preferences superior to those of our common stock. Our Articles of Incorporation allows our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without any vote or further action by our stockholders. Our board of directors has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock. As a result, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation, the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock and the right to the redemption of the shares, together with a premium, prior to the redemption of our common stock. On August 1, 2022, the Company filed the Series A Certificate with the Secretary of the State of Nevada (the “Series A Certificate”). The Series A Certificate authorizes 1,466,666 shares of Series A Preferred Stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock”), all of which were issued and sold to Pepsi, and are initially convertible at the rate of five shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share, for each share of Series A Preferred Stock. The Series A Preferred Stock ranks, with respect to distribution rights and rights on liquidation, winding-up and dissolution, (i) senior and in priority of payment to the Company’s common stock, (ii) on parity with any class or series of capital stock of the Company expressly designated as ranking on parity with the Series A Preferred Stock, and (iii) junior to any class or series of capital stock of the Company expressly designated as ranking senior to the Series A Preferred Stock. Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company (but excluding any change of control), each holder of Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive an amount per share of Series A Preferred Stock equal to the Liquidation Preference, as defined in the Series A Certificate. Holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to cumulative dividends, which will be payable quarterly in arrears either in cash, in-kind, or a combination thereof. Dividends will accrue on each share of Series A Preferred Stock at the rate of 5.00% per annum, subject to adjustment as set forth in the Series A Certificate. In addition to such quarterly regular dividends, such shares of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to participate in dividends paid to holders of common stock. 25 Our principal stockholders can exert significant influence on the Company’s corporate affairs. Our principal stockholder owns approximately 24% of our issued and outstanding common stock. Accordingly, they will be able to effectively influence the election of directors, as well as all other matters requiring stockholder approval. The interests of our principal stockholders may differ from the interests of other stockholders with respect to the issuance of shares, business transactions with or sales to other companies, selection of other directors and other business decisions. We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future . We have never paid cash dividends on our common stock. We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock at any time in the foreseeable future. The future payment of dividends directly depends upon our future earnings, capital requirements, financial requirements and other factors that our board of directors will consider. Since we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock, return on your investment, if any, will depend solely on an increase, if any, in the market value of our common stock. 26 General Risk Factors We are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act that require us to incur audit fees and legal fees in connection with the preparation of such reports. These additional costs could reduce or eliminate our ability to earn a profit. We are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and as a result, we are now required to file periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) pursuant to the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. In order to comply with these requirements, our independent registered public accounting firm has to review our financial statements on a quarterly basis and audit our financial statements on an annual basis. Moreover, our legal counsel has to review and assist in the preparation of such reports. The costs charged by these professionals for such services cannot be accurately predicted at this time because factors such as the number and type of transactions that we engage in and the complexity of our reports cannot be determined at this time and will have a major effect on the amount of time to be spent by our auditors and attorneys. However, the incurrence of such costs will obviously be an expense to our operations and thus have a negative effect on our ability to meet our overhead requirements and earn a profit. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our common stock, if a market ever develops, could drop significantly. Our periodic filings as required under the Exchange Act may be subject to review and comment by the SEC, which may result in changes to our public disclosure. Our periodic filings with the SEC in compliance with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, may be subject to review and comment by the SEC. Should the SEC conduct such review and comment, we may be required to revise such periodic filings, including but not limited to the financial statements contained therein. 27 Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. Not applicable. Item 2. Properties. We do not own any real property. We lease our principal executive offices located at 2424 North Federal Highway, Boca Raton, Florida 33431. Our premises are leased for a monthly cost of $37.6 thousand. These leases have different periods and extend until the end of 2024. We have no warehouses or other facilities in the United States as we store our product at third party contract warehouse facilities. We also have leased office space in Europe which have an aggregate monthly cost of approximately $11.6 thousand. These leases have different periods and extend until August 2023. Item 3. Legal Proceedings. We are occasionally subject to litigation or other legal proceedings relating to our business. Refer to Note 19 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements related to commitments and contingencies, which is incorporated herein by reference. In addition, from time to time, we may become party to litigation or other legal proceedings that we consider to be a part of the ordinary course of our business. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. 28 PART II Item 5. Market Price of and Dividends on the Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. Principal Market Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “ CELH .” As of February 14, 2023, there were 40 holders of record of our common stock and in excess of 5,000 beneficial owners of our common stock. The holders of record do not include stockholders whose shares are held of record by banks, brokers and other financial institutions. Dividends Pepsi On August 1, 2022, the Company issued 1,466,666 shares of the Series A Preferred Stock to Pepsi, which entitles Pepsi to cumulative dividends, which are payable quarterly in arrears either in cash, in-kind, or a combination thereof, at the Company’s election (“Regular Series A Dividends”). Regular Series A Dividends accrue on each share Series A Preferred Stock at the rate of 5.00% per annum, subject to adjustment as set forth in the Series A Certificate. In addition to such quarterly Regular Series A Dividends, shares of Series A also entitle the holder participate in any dividends paid on the Company’s common stock on an as-converted basis. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company declared and paid $11.5 million in Regular Series A Dividends, which amounted to $7.86 per share of Series A Preferred Stock. There were no cumulative undeclared dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock at December 31, 2022. In addition, there were no dividends issued to common stockholders as of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. With the exception of the Regular Series A Dividends paid to Pepsi, we have never paid cash dividends. We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock at any time in the foreseeable future. The future payment of dividends directly depends upon our future earnings, capital requirements, financial requirements and other factors that our board of directors will consider. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities None, except as previously disclosed in filings with the SEC. 29 Performance Graph The following graph shows a five-year comparison of cumulative total returns.* Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities None. Item 6. Reserved. 30 Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. You should read the following discussion in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the corresponding notes included elsewhere in this information statement. This Item 7 contains forward-looking statements. The matters discussed in these forward-looking statements are subject to risk, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those made, projected or implied in the forward-looking statements. Please refer to “ Item 1A. Risk Factors ” for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Annual Report on Form 10-K generally discusses 2022 and 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021. A detailed discussion of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. Executive Summary/Items Affecting Reported Results The COVID-19 pandemic has presented and continues to present a substantial public health and economic challenge around the world and is affecting our communities and business operations, as well as the global economy and financial markets. The human and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the measures taken or that may be taken in the future by governments, businesses (including the Company and our suppliers, distributors, co-packers and other service providers) and the public at large to limit new variants could directly and indirectly impact our business and results of operations. See “Part I. Item 1A - Risk Factors.” In spite of the global pandemic, we have worked together with our employees, distributors, co-packers and suppliers around the world to deliver another record year in net sales. Pepsi Transaction and Distribution Agreement On August 1, 2022, the Company issued 1,466,666 shares of non-voting Series A Preferred stock to Pepsi. On an as-converted basis the Series A held by Pepsi accounts for approximately 8.5% of the Company’s outstanding Common Stock, both on the date of issuance and as of December 31, 2022. Also, as discussed Note 14, the Purchase Agreement granted Pepsi the right to designate a nominee for election to the Company’s nine-member board of directors, so long as Pepsi meets certain ownership requirements with respect to the Company’s stock. During the year ended December 31, 2022, a Pepsi executive was nominated by Pepsi and elected to the Company’s board of directors. Also, on August 1, 2022, the Company entered into a Distribution Agreement with Pepsi relating to the sale and distribution of certain of the Company’s beverage products in existing channels and distribution methods in the United States, excluding certain existing customer accounts, sales channels, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Under the Distribution Agreement, the Company granted Pepsi the right to sell and distribute its existing beverage products in existing channels and distribution methods and future beverage products that are added from time to time as licensed products under the Distribution Agreement in defined territories. Distribution and Supply Chain In 2022 and 2021, the Company, as well as the international beverage sector, experienced a number of supply chain challenges which adversely impacted our operations in the form of longer transportation lead times as well as increased ingredient and other input costs, including aluminum, shipping and freight, labor, co-packing fees, and secondary packaging materials, which resulted in increased costs of revenues and increased operating costs. The Company has successfully managed through these challenges, none of which, have impacted the Company’s ability to expand its footprint across the U.S. 31 Results of Operations Year ended December 31, 2022 compared to year ended December 31, 2021 Revenue For the year ended December 31, 2022, revenue was approximately $653.6 million, an increase of $339.3 million or 108% from $314.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This growth was as a result of an increase in North America in 2022, of $344.4 million or 126% from 2021. Asia revenues (which primarily consist of royalty revenues from our China licensee) for the year ended December 31, 2022 had an increase of $1.1 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. Other international markets had an increase of $0.8 million or 129% for 2022, when compared to 2021. This was offset by a decrease in Europe revenues in 2022, of $7.0 million or 18% from 2021. The total increase in revenue from 2021 to 2022 was largely attributable to increases in sales volume, as opposed to increases in product pricing. The primary factors behind the increase in North America’s sales volume were related to continued strong triple-digit growth in traditional distribution channels, combined with an increase in and optimization of our products’ presence in world class retailers. Additionally, the continued expansion of our DSD network and our transition to the Pepsi distribution network in the fourth quarter, resulted in significant growth of our distributor revenues when compared to the prior year period. The following table sets forth the amount of revenues by category and changes therein for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021: Gross profit For the year ended December 31, 2022, gross profit increased by $142.7 million or 111% to $270.9 million, from $128.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Gross profit margins increased to 41.4% for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 40.8% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in gross profit dollars is related to increases in sales volumes, while the increase in gross profit margins from 2021 to 2022 is mainly related to our ability to leverage the increased volumes associated with our significant growth as well as increased pricing and improved processes and freight lanes, offset in part by increases in raw material costs (including high priced aluminum cans that were significantly depleted throughout 2022). The increase in gross profit dollars, includes $339.3 million related to purchase and volume increases, which was offset in part by increases in costs of $196.6 million. 32 Sales and marketing expenses Sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 were $352.8 million, an increase of $278.0 million or 372% from $74.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. We increased incremental marketing investment activities of $48.4 million from the 2021 period in comparison to 2022. Additionally, employee costs increased by $8.3 million from the 2021 year ago period as we continued to invest in this area in order to have the proper infrastructure to support our growth. Similarly, we experienced increases in other sales expense in the amount of $196.3 million mainly related to termination fees and trade-marketing activities to support our continued expansion of our DSD network. Lastly, storage and distribution as well as broker costs accounted for the remainder of the increase in this area in the amount of $25.0 million when compared to the prior year period, mainly related to the increase in business volume. General and administrative expenses General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 were $75.9 million, an increase of $18.4 million or 32% from $57.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. E mployee costs for the year ended December 31, 2022 reflect an increase o f $5.2 million or 67%, a s investments in this area were also required to properly support our higher business volume and commercial and operational areas of the business. Administrative expenses amounted to $37.0 million or an increase of $26.0 million or approximately 237%, when compared to the prior year period. This variance is mainly related to an increase in audit costs, legal expenses, insurance costs and office rent. Depreciation, amortization and impairment had an increase of $3.0 million when compared to the prior year due to investments in operational equipment (e.g., coolers) and the impairment of the Func Food brand name. The increased expenses were offset by a lower stock option expense in 2022, which was $20.7 million , a decrease of $15.8 million from the prior year period. This change in stock option expense was mainly attributable to the revaluation of certain share-based payment awards that were modified during 2021. Management deems it very important to motivate employees by providing them ownership in the business in order to promote over performance which translates into the continued success of our business based on key performance attributes. Other Income/(expense) Total net other income for the year ended December 31, 2022, was $5.1 million which reflects an increase of $5.1 million when compared to net total other income of $31.0 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2021. The variance of $5.1 million is mainly related to interest income related to our money market accounts. Income tax (expense)/benefit An income tax expense of $34.6 million was obtained during the 2022 year, primarily due to the tax impact of the $282.5 million Series A Preferred Stock fair value adjustment which will be expensed over twenty years for book purposes. As this expense is non-deductible for tax purposes, the Company recorded a $72.1 million deferred tax liability in 2022 deferred tax expense. The effective income tax rate for the twelve months ending December 31, 2022 was also impacted by disallowed stock-based compensation expense, state and local income taxes and the release of certain state income tax reserves. An income tax benefit of approximately $8.0 million was obtained during the 2021 year, mainly related to the release of our U.S. valuation allowance and windfall benefits on stock-based compensation awards. Net (loss)/income attributed to common stockholders Net loss attributed to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2022, was $198.8 million or a loss of $2.63 per share based on a weighted average of 75,649 shares outstanding. In comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2021 the Company had net income attributed to common stockholders of $3.9 million with a weighted average of 73,781 shares outstanding and a dilutive weighted average of 77,689 shares outstanding, with a $0.05 per share for each. 33 Liquidity and Capital Resources General As of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, we had unrestricted cash of $614.2 million and $16.3 million, respectively, and working capital of $756.7 million and $169.2 million, respectively. We believe that cash available from operations, including our cash resources, will be sufficient for our working capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw materials and inventory, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, purchases of capital assets, and equipment, for the next twelve (12) months, with respect to our current operating plan. Please refer to “Risk Factors” in Part 1, item 1A, for these and other factors that may have a material effect on our operations. Our primary sources of cash included cash from operations, and proceeds from the issuance of Series A convertible preferred shares. These sources of cash are available to fund cash outflows that have both a short and long-term component. Purchases of inventories, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, equipment (including coolers), advances for our distributors, co-packers, payments of accounts payable, and income taxes payable are expected to remain our principal recurring use of cash. In addition to cash flow from operations, our primary sources of working capital have been the proceeds from private placements including a private placement of 1,466,666 shares of Series A Preferred as part of our strategic transaction with Pepsi at a price of $375 per share, completed in August of 2022. Cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $108.2 million in 2022, which compares to $96.6 million net cash used by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021. The $204.8 million increase in cash generation was driven by continued growth in the operations of the Company as well as timing of cash receipts and payments associated with the Pepsi transition. The use of cash in 2021was primarily driven by higher inventory levels in order to properly service the demand for our products and to mitigate inefficiencies of the global supply chain. Cash flows (used in) provided by investing activities Cash flows used in investing activities totaled $5.7 million in 2022, which compares to cash used in investing activities of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The change in the cash used in investing activities when compared to the 2021 period was primarily due to the investment of approximately $8.3 million mainly pertaining to equipment which was partially offset by note receivable payments from our China licensee of approximately $2.6 million. Cash flows provided by financing activities Cash flows provided by financing activities totaled $534.1 million for 2022, representing a $462.7 million increase from $71.4 million in 2021. The increase of cash provided by financing activities is mainly related to the net proceeds of $542 million from the issuance of Series A convertible preferred shares related to Pepsi, net of issuance costs. Net proceeds were received from a public offering in June 2021 for approximately $67.8 million. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. 34 Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we are required to make judgments and estimates that significantly affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. Our estimates are based on historical experience, current trends and various other assumptions we believe to be relevant under the circumstances. We review the underlying factors used in our estimates regularly, including reviewing the significant accounting policies impacting the estimates, to ensure compliance with U.S. GAAP. However, due to the uncertainty inherent in our estimates, actual results may be materially different. We have identified the accounting estimates below as critical to understanding and evaluating the financial results reported in our consolidated financial statements. For a complete description of our significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements, see Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . Promotional (Billbacks) Allowance The Company’s billbacks are calculated based on various programs with distributors and retail customers, and accruals are established at the time of initial product sale for the Company’s anticipated liabilities. These accruals are based on agreed upon terms as well as the Company’s historical experience with similar programs and require management’s judgment with respect to estimating consumer participation and/or distributor and retail customer performance levels. Differences between such estimated expenses and actual expenses for promotional and other allowance costs have historically been insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. Promotional and other allowances primarily include consideration given to distributors or retail customers, including, but not limited to, the following: (i) discounts granted off list prices to support price promotions to end consumers by retailers; (ii) reimbursements given to distributors for agreed portions of their promotional spend with retailers, including slotting, shelf space allowances, and other fees for both new and existing products; (iii) agreed share of fees given to distributors and/or directly to retailers for advertising, in-store marketing, and promotional activities; (iv) agreed share of slotting, shelf space allowances, and other fees given directly to retailers, club stores and/or wholesalers; (v) incentives given to distributors and/or retailers for achieving or exceeding certain predetermined volumes goals; (vi) discounted products; (vii) contractual fees given to distributors related to sales made by the Company directly to certain customers that fall within the distributors’ sales territories; and (viii) contractual fees given to distributors for items sold below defined pricing targets. The promotional programs are of varying durations, typically ranging from one week to one year based on the agreed-upon terms. The nature of such programs is determined on a per retail customer or distributor basis, and in certain instances, the same program is set for multiple customers or distributors. The billback fees are recorded as a reduction to net sales in the period the underlying sale occurs. Total promotional expenditures included as a reduction to revenue were $158.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, and accrued promotional allowances were $36.0 million as of December 31, 2022. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied. Product sales occur once control or title is transferred based on the commercial terms. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods. Product sales are recorded net of variable consideration, such as provisions for returns, discounts and allowances. Such provisions are calculated using historical averages and adjusted for any expected changes due to current business conditions. Consideration given to customers for cooperative advertising is recognized as a reduction of revenue except to the extent that there is a distinct good or service, in which case the expense is classified as selling or marketing expense. The amount of consideration the Company receives and revenue the Company recognizes varies with changes in customer incentives the Company offers to its customers and their customers. Additionally, for any agreements which are one year or less, the practical expedient under ASC 340-40-25-4 is applied to expense contract acquisition costs when incurred if the amortization period of the contract asset would have otherwise been recognized in one year or less. Sales taxes and other similar taxes are excluded from revenue. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for cash discounts, returns and spoilage based on the Company’s historical experience. 35 Goodwill and Intangible Assets Valuation We evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or when an interim triggering event occurs that would indicate impairment may have taken place. We evaluate our other definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when evidence exists that certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Judgments and assumptions are required in such impairment evaluations. During the third quarter of 2022, we entered into a long term distribution agreement with Pepsi. The addition of the Pepsi distribution network has shifted the Company’s focus to the US market and as a consequence it was determined that impairment indicators for the Func Foods brands indefinite intangible asset were present. The Company no longer anticipates focusing on the expansion of Func Food branded products and the Company plans to focus on Celsius branded products. As a result of the strategic shift, which the Company considered a triggering event, the Company quantitatively tested the Func Foods brand name for impairment utilizing the relief from royalty method to determine fair value. As a result of the quantitative assessment, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $2.5 million which is presented within General and Administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income. Our annual impairment evaluation of goodwill involves qualitative aspects, including comparing our single reporting unit’s fair value to its respective carrying value. Some of the qualitative aspects evaluated included macro-economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors regarding our raw materials and operations and overall financial performance of our business. We use the income approach to determine the fair value of our definite-lived customer relationships intangible asset. In accordance with FASB ASC 350, intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are measured for impairment at least annually, or when events indicate that an impairment exists. The Company calculates impairment as the excess of the carrying value of its indefinite-lived assets over their estimated fair value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimate of fair value a write-down is recorded. The Company amortizes its trademarks with finite useful lives over their respective useful lives. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill and intangible assets impaired in future periods. Additionally, disruptions to our business such as prolonged recessionary periods or unexpected significant declines in operating results could result in impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets in future periods. Changes in the factors used in our fair value estimates, including the impacts of the cost inflation or other margin erosion, and discount rates used, could have a significant impact on the fair values of the reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. In the normal course of business our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks. The principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) to which we are exposed are fluctuations in commodity and other input prices affecting the costs of our raw materials (including, but not limited to increases in the price of aluminum cans, sucralose, caffeine, vitamins, fluctuations in energy and fuel prices). We generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials. We are also subject to market risks with respect to the cost of commodities and other inputs because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. We do not use derivative financial instruments to protect ourselves from fluctuations in interest rates and generally do not hedge against fluctuations in commodity prices. Our net sales to customers outside of the United States were approximately 6% and 13% of consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. As a result, we are subject to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. As of December 31, 2022, we had $0.5 million in cash which is not subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. Item 8.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure Not applicable. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. Disclosure controls and procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms adopted by the SEC, including to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial and accounting officer), or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our President and Chief Executive Officer as well as our Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based on that evaluation, our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report because of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described below. Notwithstanding the conclusion by our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer that our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022 were not effective, and notwithstanding the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below, management believes that the consolidated financial statements and related financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as of the dates presented, and for the periods ended on such dates, in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and financial officers and effected by the Company’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: 37 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013) (the “COSO Framework”). A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As of December 31, 2022, management has identified the following material weaknesses in internal controls: As a result of the material weaknesses described above, the Company’s management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective. Remediation Plan As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, management is re-assessing the design of controls and modifying processes designed to improve our internal control over financial reporting and remediate the control deficiencies that led to the material weaknesses, including but not limited to (a) improving consistency in change management supported by standard operating procedures to govern the authorization, testing and approval of changes to information technology systems supporting all of the Company’s internal control processes, (b) enhancing design and implementation of our control environment, including the expansion of formal accounting and IT policies and procedures and financial reporting controls, (c) continuing to identify and design and implement effective review and approval controls, and (d) implementing appropriate timely review and oversight responsibilities within the accounting and financial reporting functions. Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting Except for the determination by management of the material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting described above, there have been no other changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Celsius Holdings, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weaknesses described below on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, Celsius Holdings, Inc. (the Company) has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weaknesses have been identified and included in management’s assessment. Management has identified material weaknesses relating to: We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2022 consolidated financial statements of the Company. These material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2022 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated March 1, 2023, which expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. F- 2 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2021. Boca Raton, Florida March 1, 2023 F- 3 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Celsius Holdings, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Celsius Holdings, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income, statement of changes in stockholders’ equity and mezzanine equity, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March 1, 2023 expressed an adverse opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. F- 4 Accrued Promotional Allowances As discussed in Notes 2 and 4, the Company’s promotional allowances are calculated based on various programs with its distributors and retail customers, and accruals are established at the time of the initial product sale for the Company’s anticipated liabilities. These accruals are based on agreed-upon terms as well as the Company’s historical experience with similar programs and require management’s judgment with respect to estimating consumer participation and/or distributor and retail customer performance levels. Promotional allowances primarily include consideration given to distributors or retail customers, including, but not limited to, the following: (i) discounts granted off list prices to support price promotions to end consumers by retailers; (ii) reimbursements given to distributors for agreed portions of their promotional spend with retailers, including slotting, shelf space allowances, and other fees for both new and existing products; (iii) agreed share of fees given to distributors and/or directly to retailers for advertising, in-store marketing, and promotional activities; (iv) agreed share of slotting, shelf space allowances, and other fees given directly to retailers, club stores and/or wholesalers; (v) incentives given to distributors and/or retailers for achieving or exceeding certain predetermined volumes; (vi) discounted products; (vii) contractual fees given to distributors related to sales made by the Company directly to certain customers that fall within the distributors’ sales territories; and (viii) contractual fees given to distributors for items sold below defined pricing targets. The promotional programs are of varying durations, typically ranging from one week to one year based on the agreed-upon terms. The promotional expenditures are recorded to the corresponding income statement caption in the period the underlying sale occurs. Total promotional expenditures included as a reduction to revenue were $158.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, and accrued promotional allowances were $36.0 million as of December 31, 2022. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit To test the accrued promotional allowances, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating management’s judgment regarding levels of consumer participation and/or distributor and retail customer performance levels and future promotional claims. We selected a sample of accrued promotional allowances recorded for specific distributors and retail customers and sent confirmation requests of the accrual recorded directly to the distributor or retail customer. We compared the confirmation response to the accrued amount recorded by the Company. In instances of nonreplies to our confirmation request from the distributor or retail customer, we compared subsequent settlements to the accrual. If not settled, we developed an independent expectation of the accrual using historical claim and payment data and compared it to the recorded accrued promotional allowance. We tested the promotional expenditure amount recorded as a reduction to net sales and assessed the reasonableness of management’s estimate by developing an expectation of the amount, based on historical promotional expenditure amounts recorded as a percentage of sales, and compared our expectation to the recorded promotional expenditure amount. We performed inquiries of the Company’s sales and marketing personnel to corroborate our understanding of new and existing promotional programs that may alter the relationship between gross billings and promotional allowances, as such programs are considered by management when estimating future promotional claims. We also evaluated management’s ability to estimate promotional allowances by comparing the actual promotional allowances subsequently paid to the original estimates of management. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2021. Boca Raton, Florida March 1, 2023 F- 5 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Celsius Holdings, Inc.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.

Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. F- 6 Collectability of Note Receivable Description of the Matter Effective January 1, 2019, the Company entered into a separate economic agreement for the repayment of its marketing investment in China with Qifeng. Under the repayment agreement, Qifeng agreed to refund the Company over a five-year period. The repayment was formalized via a Note Receivable (“Note”) from Qifeng. The initial outstanding principal under the Note was approximately $12.2 million and was denominated in the Chinese Renminbi (CNY). Installment payments under the Note are due on March 31 each year and the first installment payment on the Note was due March 31, 2020. This payment was delayed and paid in September 2020 due to the COVID 19 pandemic. The next installment payment due March 31, 2021 will be paid via a release of 62,000 shares of Celsius common stock owned by Qifeng. This release will provide sufficient funds to pay the full amount that is due under the second installment payment. Under a separate guarantee agreement the Company will maintain control over 275,079 Celsius common shares which serves as collateral for the payment on the remaining amounts that will become due over the next three-years. We determined based on the fact pattern noted above the long term collectability of the remaining Note balance was as a critical audit matter. The Note is collateralized by the Company’s shares, however we noted that there is volatility relating to the value of the collateral which is based on the share price of the Company’s stock. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following: 1. Obtaining and testing for reasonableness of management’s analysis to support the collectability of the remaining Note balance. 2. Obtained, a confirmation from Qifeng of the remaining balance due under the Note as of December 31, 2020 as well as confirming their intent and ability to pay the next installment keeping them current with the agreement. 3. Reviewed a signed guarantee letter from Qifeng over the Company shares that are being used as collateral associated with the remainder of the Note. 4. Obtained the Qifeng account statement from the Company’s transfer agent verifying the number of shares owned by Qifeng. The value of the collateral shares at December 31, 2020 was in excess of the total note receivable balance as of December 31, 2020. Based on the procedures performed and evidence obtained we concluded that no allowance for collectability was required related to the Note as of December 31, 2020.

Significant Estimates — The preparation of consolidated financial statements and accompanying disclosures in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions that the Company may undertake in the future, actual results may differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts, allowance for inventory obsolescence and sales returns, preferred share valuation, the useful lives of property and equipment, impairment of goodwill and intangibles, deferred tax asset valuation allowance, promotional allowance, and valuation of stock-based compensation. Additionally, the business and economic uncertainty resulting from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has made such estimates and assumptions more difficult to calculate. Accordingly, actual results and outcomes could differ from those estimates. Segment Reporting — Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise that engage in business activities, have discrete financial information, and whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) to make decisions about allocating resources and to assess performance. Even though the Company has operations in several geographies, it operates as a single enterprise. The Company’s operations and strategies are centrally designed and executed given that our geographical components are very similar. Our CODM, the CEO, reviews operating results primarily from a consolidated perspective, and makes decisions and allocates resources based on that review. The reason the Company’s CODM focuses on consolidated results in making decisions and allocating resources is because of the significant economic interdependencies between the Company’s geographical operations and the Company’s U.S. entity. Concentrations of Risk — Substantially all of the Company’s revenue derives from the sale of Celsius ® functional energy drinks and liquid supplements. Pepsi and the Company signed a distribution agreement on August 1, 2022, resulting in Pepsi acting as the Company’s preferred distributor performing the direct store delivery for a majority of the Company’s U.S. operations. Revenue of our customers accounting for more than 10%, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, are as follows: F- 13 Accounts receivable of our customers accounting for more than 10%, for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, are as follows: Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with high-quality financial institutions. At times, balances in the Company’s cash accounts may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had approximately $ 652.4 million and $ 16.0 million, respectively, including $38.8 38,768 million in restricted cash for 2022, in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit. Cash and Cash Equivalents — The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Restricted Cash — As disclosed in Note 4. Revenues , the Company received upfront payments from Pepsi during 2022, which are contractually restricted and can only be used to satisfy termination payments due to former distributors or have to be repaid to Pepsi. These upfront payments received from Pepsi cannot be used for general operating activities of the Company and have been classified as restricted cash based on the terms of the Transition Agreement. Accounts Receivable — Accounts receivable are reported at net realizable value. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors pertaining to the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends, and other information. Delinquent accounts are written-off when it is determined that the amounts are uncollectible. Accounts receivable are presented net of billbacks, for customers that are allowed the right to net settle. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, there was an allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately $ 2.1 million and $ 0.8 million, respectively. Inventories — Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company recorded an allowance of approximately $ 8.4 million and $ 2.6 million respectively. The changes in the allowance are included in cost of revenue. Property and Equipment — Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation of property and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset generally ranging from three 3 to seven 7 years. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets — In accordance with ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment the Company reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is determined regarding a long-lived asset if its carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The carrying amount is not recoverable when it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from use of the asset over its remaining useful life and final disposition. The Company did not record any impairments related to long lived assets during the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. F- 14 Long-lived Asset Geographic Data The following table contains long-lived asset information which includes property and equipment and lease right of use assets and excludes goodwill and intangibles, where individual countries represent a material portion of the total: Goodwill — The Company records goodwill when the consideration paid for the acquisition of a business exceeds the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, including related tax effects. Goodwill is not amortized; instead, goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of October 1 st , or more frequently if the Company believes indicators of impairment exist. The Company first assesses qualitative factors such as macro-economic conditions, industry and market conditions, and cost factors as well as other relevant events, to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then the Company will calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. If the Company determines that the fair value is less than the carrying value, the Company will recognize an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying value over its fair value. At December 31, 2022, there were no indicators of impairment. Intangible assets — Intangible assets are comprised of customer relationships and brands acquired in a business combination. The Company amortizes intangible assets with a definitive life over their respective useful lives. The addition of the Pepsi distribution network has shifted the Company’s focus to the US market and as a consequence it was determined that impairment indicators for the Func Foods brands indefinite intangible asset were present. The Company no longer anticipates focusing on the expansion of Func Food branded products and the Company plans to focus on Celsius branded products. As a result of the strategic shift, which the Company considered a triggering event, the Company quantitatively tested the Func Foods brand name for impairment utilizing the relief from royalty method to determine fair value as of September 30, 2022. As a result of the quantitative assessment, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $ 2.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 which is presented within General and Administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Revenue Recognition — The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied. Product sales occur once control or title is transferred based on the commercial terms. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods. Product sales are recorded net of variable consideration, such as provisions for returns, discounts and promotional allowances. Such provisions are calculated using historical averages and adjusted for any expected changes due to current business conditions. Consideration given to customers for cooperative advertising is recognized as a reduction of revenue except to the extent that there is a distinct good or service, in which case the expense is classified as selling or marketing expense. The amount of consideration the Company receives and revenue the Company recognizes varies with changes in customer incentives the Company offers to its customers and their customers. Additionally, for any agreements which are one year or less, the practical expedient under ASC 340-40-25-4 is applied to expense contract acquisition costs when incurred if the amortization period of the contract asset would have otherwise been recognized in one year or less. Sales taxes and other similar taxes are excluded from revenue. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for cash discounts, returns, spoilage and promotional allowances based on the Company’s historical experience. F- 15 Deferred Revenue — The Company receives payments from certain distributors in new territories as reimbursement for contract termination costs paid to the prior distributors in those territories. Amounts received pursuant to these new and/or amended distribution agreements entered into with certain distributors relating to the costs associated with terminating the Company’s prior distributors, are accounted for as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the anticipated life of the respective new distribution agreements. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately $ 189.5 million in deferred revenue, of which $ 179.8 million is classified as deferred revenue-non-current and $ 9.7 million is classified as deferred revenue-current which are presented within the consolidated balance sheets and are contract liabilities related to termination payments received from Pepsi. Refer to Note 13, Related Party Transactions for more information. The deferred revenues will be recognized by the Company, ratably over the twenty-year agreement term. As of December 31, 2021, the Company did not have any deferred revenue related to contract liabilities. Accrued Distributor Termination Fees — Termination charges related to certain of the Company’s prior distributors are included in selling and marketing expenses upon termination. The Company recognized distributor termination expenses of approximately $ 193.8 million, $ 0.6 million, and $ 0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The Company also has a balance of $ 4.0 million in accrued distributor termination fees related to distributors terminated as a result of the Pepsi agreement as well as payment due back to Pepsi in the amount of $ 34.8 million as the projected payments to the prior distributors was less than the payment received from Pepsi, which are located within accounts payable and accrued expenses, on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Customer Advances — From time to time the Company requires deposits in advance of delivery of products and/or production runs. Such amounts are initially recorded as customer advances liability within other current liabilities. The Company recognizes such revenue as it is earned in accordance with revenue recognition policies. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did no t have any customer advances. Advertising Costs — Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. The Company uses mainly radio, local sampling events, sponsorships, endorsements, and digital advertising. The Company incurred advertising expenses of approximately $ 85.1 million, $ 36.7 million and $ 14.2 million, during years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Research and Development — Research and development costs are charged to general and administrative expenses as incurred and consist primarily of consulting fees, raw material usage and test productions of beverages. The Company incurred expenses of approximately $ 0.4 million, $ 1.0 million and $ 0.5 million during years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Foreign Currency Gain/Losses — Foreign subsidiaries’ functional currency is the local currency of operations and the net assets of foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates. The foreign subsidiaries perform re-measurements of their assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies on a periodic basis and the gain or losses from these adjustments are included in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive (loss) income as foreign exchange gains or losses. For the year ended December 31, 2022 exchange losses have amounted to approximately $ 0.4 million while during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized a foreign currency loss and gain of approximately $ 0.3 million and $ 1.4 million, respectively, mainly related to fluctuations in exchange rates. Translation gains and losses that arise from the translation of net assets from functional currency to the reporting currency, as well as exchange gains and losses on intercompany balances of long-term investment nature, are included in Other Comprehensive Income. The Company incurred foreign currency translation net loss during the year ended December 31, 2022 of approximately $ 2.5 million and a net gain of approximately $ 0.8 million and $ 0.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The Company’s operations in different countries required that it transacts in the following currencies: Chinese-Yuan Norwegian-Krone Swedish-Krona Finland-Euro F- 16 Fair Value of Financial Instruments — The carrying value of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate fair value due to their relative short-term maturity and market interest rates. Income Taxes — The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the provisions of ASC Topic 740 Accounting for Income Taxes , which requires, among other things, an asset and liability approach to calculating deferred income taxes. The asset and liability approach require the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets for which management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred asset will not be realized. The Company follows the provisions of the ASC 740-10 related to Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Positions. When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10, the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. The Company has adopted ASC 740-10-25 Definition of Settlement, which provides guidance on how an entity should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits and provides that a tax position can be effectively settled upon the completion of an examination by a taxing authority without being legally extinguished. For tax positions considered effectively settled, an entity would recognize the full amount of tax benefit, even if the tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained based solely on the basis of its technical merits and the statute of limitations remains open. The Company’s tax returns for tax years in 2019 through 2021 remain subject to potential examination by the taxing authorities. Earnings per Share — The Company computes earnings per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260 Earnings per Share (“ASC 260”), which requires earnings per share (“EPS”) for each class of stock (common stock and participating preferred stock) to be calculated using the two-class method. The two-class method is an allocation of earnings (distributed and undistributed) between the holders of common stock and a company’s participating security holders. Under the two-class method, earnings for the reporting period are allocated between common stockholders and other security holders based on their respective participation rights in undistributed earnings. Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income or loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of basic common stock outstanding. The Company’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is classified as a participating security in accordance with ASC 260. Net income allocated to the holders of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock will be calculated based on the stockholders’ proportionate share of weighted average shares of common stock outstanding on an if-converted basis. See Note 3. Earnings Per Share for more information. Share-Based Payments — The Company follows the provisions of ASC Topic 718 Compensation — Stock Compensation and related interpretations. As such, compensation cost is measured on the date of grant at the fair value of the share-based payments. Such compensation amounts, if any, are amortized over the respective vesting periods of the grants. On April 30, 2015, the Company adopted the 2015 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2015 Plan”). This 2015 Plan is intended to provide incentives which will attract and retain highly competent persons at all levels as employees of the Company, as well as independent contractors providing consulting or advisory services to the Company, by providing them opportunities to acquire the Company’s common stock. The 2015 Plan permits the grant of options and other share-based awards for up to 5.0 million shares. Provisions have been made to permit the grant of options and other share-based awards for up to 5.0 million shares.

Certain reclassification of prior period balances have been made to conform to current presentation. Please refer to consolidated balance sheets, Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and Note 11. Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses Recent Accounting Pronouncements The Company adopts all applicable, new accounting pronouncements as of the specified effective dates. In September 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326) (“ASU 2016-13”), which requires the immediate recognition of management’s estimates of current and expected credit losses. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10, which delays the effective date of Topic 326 for Smaller Reporting Companies to interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. The Company has elected the relief provided. Topic 326 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2023. Adoption of the new standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures. Liquidity — These financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will be able to continue as a going concern. At December 31, 2022, the Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately $ 238.8 238,772 million which includes a net loss available to common stockholders of approximately $ 198.8 198,808 million for year ended December 31, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2022 the Company’s net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately $ 108.2 108,182 million .

During the year ended December 31, 2021 the Company’s net cash used by operating activities totaled approximately $ 96.6 96,586 million . If our sales volumes do not meet our projections, expenses exceed our expectations, or our plans change, we may be unable to generate enough cash flow from operations to cover our working capital requirements. In such case, we may be required to adjust our business plan, by reducing marketing, lower our working capital requirements and reduce other expenses or seek additional financing. Furthermore, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in the global macro-economic environment related to the pandemic and public health crises related to the COVID-19 outbreak. F- 18 The Company computes earnings per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260 Earnings per Share (“ASC 260”), which requires earnings per share for each class of stock (common stock and participating preferred stock) to be calculated using the two-class method. The two-class method is an allocation of earnings (distributed and undistributed) between the holders of common stock and a company’s participating security holders. Under the two-class method, earnings for the reporting period are allocated between common stockholders and other security holders based on their respective participation rights in undistributed earnings. Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income or loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of basic common stock outstanding. The Company’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is classified as a participating security in accordance with ASC 260. Net income allocated to the holders of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock consistent of preferred dividends declared and paid during 2022. The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock do not participate in losses, thus no such losses have been allocated to the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock in the periods presented below. For purposes of determining diluted earnings per common share, basic earnings per common share was further adjusted to include the effect of potential dilutive common shares outstanding, including unvested restricted stock and performance-based stock units, using the more dilutive of either the two-class method or the treasury stock method, and Series A Convertible Preferred Stock using the if-converted method. Stock options and warrants that were out-of-the-money were not included in the denominator for the calculation of diluted EPS. Under the two-class method of calculating diluted earnings per share, net income is reallocated to common stock, the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, and all dilutive securities based on the contractual participating rights of the security to share in the current earnings as if all of the earnings for the period had been distributed. For the years ended December 31, For the year ended December 31, 2022, 10.2 million of potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share related to common stockholders as their effect was antidilutive. F- 19 The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied. Product sales occur once control is transferred, based on the commercial terms. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods. Product sales are recorded net of variable consideration, such as provisions for returns, discounts and allowances. Such provisions are calculated using historical averages and adjusted for any expected changes due to current business conditions. Consideration given to customers for cooperative advertising is recognized as a reduction of revenue except to the extent that there is a distinct good or service, in which case the expense is classified as selling or marketing expense. The amount of consideration the Company receives and revenue the Company recognizes varies with changes in customer incentives the Company offers to its customers and their customers. Additionally, for any agreements which are one year or less, the practical expedient under ASC 340-40-25-4 is applied to expense contract acquisition costs when incurred if the amortization period of the contract asset would have otherwise been recognized in one year or less. Promotional (Billback) Allowance The Company’s billback allowance programs with its distributors and/or retailers are executed through separate agreements in the ordinary course of business. These agreements generally provide for one or more of the arrangements described above and are of varying durations, typically ranging from one week to one year. The Company’s billbacks are calculated based on various programs with distributors and retail customers, and accruals are established for the Company’s anticipated liabilities. These accruals are based on agreed upon terms as well as the Company’s historical experience with similar programs and require management’s judgment with respect to estimating consumer participation and/or distributor and retail customer performance levels. Differences between such estimated expenses and actual expenses for promotional and other allowance costs have historically been insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. Billbacks (variable consideration) recorded as a reduction to net sales, primarily include consideration given to the Company’s distributors or retail customers including, but not limited to the following: For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, promotional allowance included as a reduction of revenue were $ 158.5 million, $ 64.2 million, and $ 28.7 million, respectively. F- 20 Information about the Company’s net sales by geographical location for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 is as follows: All of the Company’s North America revenue is derived from the United States, which is the Company’s country of domicile. Of the Company’s total foreign revenues of approximately $ 36.1 million, $ 41.3 million and $ 35.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, Sweden represented the largest foreign portion of total consolidated revenue of approximately $ 21.7 million, $ 26.9 million, and $ 23.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Agreements with PepsiCo, Inc. The Company executed multiple agreements with Pepsi on August 1, 2022, including a Distribution Agreement relating to the sale and distribution of certain of the Company’s beverage products in existing channels and distribution methods in the United States, excluding certain existing customer accounts, sales channels, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands (the “Territory”). Under the Distribution Agreement, the Company has granted Pepsi the right to sell and distribute its existing beverage products in existing channels and distribution methods and future beverage products that are added from time to time as licensed products under the Distribution Agreement in defined territories. The Distribution Agreement represents a master service agreement and can be cancelled by either party without cause in the nineteenth year of the term (i.e., 2041), the twenty-ninth year of the term (i.e., 2051) and each ten (10) year period thereafter (i.e., 2061, 2071, etc.) by providing twelve (12) months’ written notice on August 1st of each such year to the other party. Except for a termination by the Company “with cause” or a termination by Pepsi “without cause”, the Company is required to pay the Purchaser certain compensation upon a termination as specified in the Distribution Agreement. The Company agreed to provide Pepsi a right of first offer in the event the Company intends to (i) manufacture, distribute or sell products in certain additional countries as specified in the Distribution Agreement or (ii) distribute or sell products in any future channels and distribution methods during the term of the Agreement. Additionally, pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, the Company and Pepsi agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate and execute with Pepsi a distribution agreement reasonably consistent with the Distribution Agreement for the sale and distribution of the products covered by the Distribution Agreement in Canada, and Pepsi agreed to meet and confer in good faith with the Company regarding the terms and conditions upon which Pepsi may be willing to sell or distribute such products, either directly or through local sub-distributors in certain other additional countries. The Distribution Agreement includes other customary provisions, including non-competition covenants in favor of the Company, representations and warranties, indemnification provisions, insurance provisions and confidentiality provisions. On August 1, 2022, the Company and Pepsi also executed the Transition Agreement, providing for the Company’s transition of certain existing distribution rights in the Territory to Pepsi. Under the terms of the Transition Agreement, Pepsi would pay the Company up to $ 250 million in multiple tranches to facilitate the Company’s transition of certain distribution rights to Pepsi. Amounts received from Pepsi were contractually restricted to only be used to pay termination fees due to other distributors; any excess cash received over amounts due to other distributors is to be refunded back to Pepsi. During 2022, the Company received $ 227.8 million in payments from Pepsi. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had recorded $ 193.8 million in total termination expenses in Selling and marketing expenses, of which $ 193.0 million in termination expenses are related to the Pepsi transition. F- 21 Accounting for the agreements executed with PepsiCo, Inc. The Company evaluated the Security Purchase Agreement, Transition Agreement, Distribution Agreement, and other agreements executed with Pepsi on August 1, 2022, as one combined contract since the agreements were executed on the same day, with the same counterparty, in contemplation of one another and contractual terms are defined and referenced across the agreements. These agreements will be referred to as the “Pepsi Arrangement” herein. Management concluded the Pepsi Arrangement was partially in the scope of ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”) and partially in the scopes of ASC 505, Equity (“ASC 505”) and ASC 480, Distinguishing liabilities from equity (“ASC 480”). The Company first applied the measurement and classification criteria in ASC 505 and ASC 480 with respect to the Company’s issuance of 1,446,666 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, as the substance of the issuance of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock was determined to be a financing transaction. See Note 14. Mezzanine Equity for the Company’s accounting conclusions with respect to the issuance of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. After application of the measurement and classification principles in ASC 505, and ASC 480, the Company accounted for the residual revenue elements of the Pepsi Arrangement under ASC 606. The revenue elements of the Pepsi Arrangement consisted of (i) $ 227.8 million in payments received from Pepsi under the Transition Agreement and (ii) a $ 282.5 million implicit payment made to Pepsi by Celsius, representing the excess fair value over issuance proceeds received for the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. The $ 227.8 million upfront payment received from Pepsi was only to be used by Celsius to transition territory rights from terminated distributors to Pepsi; any excess cash received from Pepsi over transition payments made by Celsius to the Company’s terminated distributors was contractually restricted and due back to Pepsi. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has recorded a refund liability of $ 34.8 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses representing cash refunds due back to Pepsi and recognized the difference of $ 193.0 million as part of deferred revenues. The deferred revenues will be recognized by Celsius ratably over the twenty-year agreement term. The Company recognized $ 4.2 million of total deferred revenues in the consolidated statement of separations in the year ended December 31, 2022. The $ 282.5 million excess fair value over issuance proceeds of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock represents an implicit payment made to a customer. The Company concluded that this implicit payment meets the definition of an asset, and has been recorded as a Deferred Other Cost current and non-current, in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The Company will amortize the asset balance as contra-revenues ratably over a twenty-year period consistent with the term of the Distribution Agreement. The Company recognized contra-revenues of $ 5.9 million in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive (loss) income in the year ended December 31, 2022 related to the upfront payment included in Deferred Other Cost current and non-current. The Company will assess the Deferred Other Cost asset for impairment at each reporting period. For product sales under the Distribution Agreement, the Company will recognize revenues when control of the underlying goods are transferred to Pepsi based on the contractual terms of noncancellable purchase orders issued by Pepsi. License Agreement In January 2019, the Company entered into a license and repayment of investment agreement with Qifeng Food Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd (“Qifeng”). Under the agreement, Qifeng was granted the exclusive license rights to manufacture, market and commercialize Celsius branded products in China. The term of the agreement is 50 years, with annual royalty fees due from Qifeng after the end of each calendar year. The royalty fees are based on a percentage of Qifeng’s sales of Celsius branded products; however, the fees are fixed for the first five years of the agreement, totaling approximately $6.9 million, and then are subject to annual guaranteed minimums over the remaining term of the agreement. Under the agreement, the Company grants Qifeng exclusive license rights and provides ongoing support in product development, brand promotion and technical expertise. The ongoing support is integral to the exclusive license rights and, as such, both of these represent a combined, single performance obligation. The transaction price consists of the guaranteed minimums and the variable royalty fees, all of which are allocated to the single performance obligation. The Company recognizes revenue from the agreement over time because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits from the services. The Company uses the passage of time to measure progress towards satisfying its performance obligation because of its ongoing efforts in providing the exclusive license rights including providing continuous access, updates and support. Total revenue recognized under the agreement was approximately $ 2.0 million, $ 1.6 million, and $ 0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 which is reflected in the revenues from Asia. F- 22 Inventories consist of the following at: Prepaid expenses and other current assets total approximately $ 11.3 11,341 million and $ 13.6 13,555 million, at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and consist mainly of prepaid advances to co-packers related to inventory production, advertising, prepaid insurance, prepaid slotting fees, value added tax payments and deposits on purchases. Note receivable consists of the following at: Effective January 1, 2019, the Company restructured its China distribution efforts by entering into two separate economic agreements as it relates to the commercialization of its Celsius products (i.e., the license and repayment of investment agreement with Qifeng, as described above). See Note 4 for information regarding the license agreement with Qifeng. Under a separate economic agreement, Qifeng will repay the marketing investments made by Celsius into the China market through 2018, over the same five-year period as the license agreement. The repayment, which was formalized via a note receivable from Qifeng (the “Note”), will need to be serviced even if the licensing agreement is cancelled or terminated. The Note is denominated in Chinese-Yuan. The Note accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to the weighted average of 5 % of the outstanding principal up to $ 5 million and 2 % of the outstanding principal above $ 5 million. On June 12, 2020, it was agreed to fix the interest rate at 3.21 % which reflected the weighted average interest rate for the 5-year period of the Note. Scheduled principal payments plus accrued interest for the Note are due annually on March 31 of each year starting in 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, interest income for the Note was approximately $ 0.2 million, $ 0.3 million, and $ 0.4 million respectively. The Company assesses the note receivable for impairment at each reporting period, by evaluating whether it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all the contractual principal and interest payments as scheduled in the Note, based on historical experience of Qifeng’s ability to pay, the current economic environment and other factors. If the Note is determined to be impaired, the impairment is measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flows under the Note, discounted at the Note’s effective interest rate. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Note was not deemed to be impaired. As of December 31, 2022, Qifeng is current on all amounts due under the Note and the license agreement. As evidence of solvency for the Note, a stock certificate in Celsius Holding’s Inc. which amounts to 30.0 thousand of shares owned by an affiliate under common control of Qifeng is being held at a brokerage account. A letter of guarantee was executed with several restrictions regarding their shares. In particular, it was agreed that the stock would not be sold or transferred without the prior written consent from Celsius. There are other restrictions and agreements, which include that a statement of account will be provided to Celsius on a quarterly basis to confirm and validate the existence of the remaining shares. The shares serve as one component of management’s consideration when evaluating impairment indicators. F- 23 The Company’s leasing activities include an operating lease of its corporate office space from a related party (see Note 13) and other operating and finance leases of vehicles and office space for the Company’s European operations. At the inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. The Company’s assessment is based on: (1) whether the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (2) whether the Company obtains the right to substantially all the economic benefit from the use of the asset throughout the term, and (3) whether the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. The Company allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease and non-lease component based on the component’s relative stand-alone price to determine the lease payments. Lease and non-lease components are accounted for separately. Leases are classified as either finance leases or operating leases based on criteria in ASC Topic 842 Leases . The Company’s operating leases are generally comprised of real estate and vehicles, and the Company’s finance leases are generally comprised of vehicles. At lease commencement, the Company records a lease liability equal to the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. A corresponding right-of-use asset (“ROU asset”) is recorded, measured based on the initial measurement of the lease liability. ROU assets also include any lease payments made and exclude lease incentives. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in general and administrative expenses. Included in lease expense are any variable lease payments incurred in the period that were not included in the initial lease liability. Lease expense for finance leases consists of the amortization of the ROU asset on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease term, and interest expense is calculated using the effective interest rate method. The future annual minimum lease payments required under the Company’s leases as of December 31, 2022 are as follows: Property and equipment consist of the following at: Depreciation expense amounted to approximately $1.4 1,362 million, $ 0.6 550 million, and $ 0.1 127 million during years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. F- 24 At December 31, 2022, goodwill consists of approximately $ 13.7 million resulting from the excess of the consideration paid and the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired from the Func Food acquisition. Intangible assets consist of acquired customer relationships and brands from the Func Food acquisition. The gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of intangible assets were as follows as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021: Customer relationships are amortized over an estimated useful life of 25 years and brands have an indefinite life. Amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 was approximately $ 0.5 million, $ 0.6 million, and $ 0.6 million, respectively and is reflected in general and administrative expenses. See note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , for more information regarding our indefinite-lived intangible asset, Brands. Other fluctuations in the amounts of intangible assets are due to currency translation adjustments. The following is the future estimated amortization expense related to customer relationships as of December 31, 2022: F- 25 Accounts payable and accrued expenses consist of the following at: Other current liabilities consist of the following at: F- 26 Transactions with PepsiCo, Inc. As further described in Note 14 Mezzanine Equity , on August 1, 2022, the Company issued 1,466,666 shares of non-voting Series A Convertible Preferred stock (“Series A”) to Pepsi. On an as-converted basis the Series A held by Pepsi accounts for approximately 8.5 % of the Company’s outstanding Common Stock, both on the date of issuance and as of December 31, 2022. Also, as discussed Note 14, the Securities Purchase Agreement entered into on August 1, 2022 (the “Purchase Agreement”) granted Pepsi the right to designate a nominee for election to the Company’s nine-member board of directors, so long as Pepsi meets certain ownership requirements with respect to the Company’s stock. During the year ended December 31, 2022, a Pepsi executive was nominated by Pepsi and elected to the Company’s board of directors. Based on Pepsi’s contractual representation rights for a seat on the Company’s Board of Directors, the Company has concluded that Pepsi represents a related party to the Company. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, the following transactions were recognized in the Company’s financial statements: See Notes 1. Organization and Description of Business, 2. Basis of Presentation Significant Accounting Policies, 11. Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses, and 14. Mezzanine Equity for more information. Related Party Leases The Company’s office is rented from a company affiliated with CD Financial, LLC which is controlled by one of our major stockholders. The lease extends until December 2024 with a monthly rent of $ 37.6 thousand. F- 27 Series A Convertible Preferred Stock As of December 31, 2022, Company has designated and authorized 1,466,666 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock with a par value of $ 0.001 per share and a stated value of $ 375 per share. The stated value per share may be increased from time-to-time in the event dividends on the Series A are paid-in-kind (“PIK dividends”) pursuant to the Series A Certification of Designation (the “Series A Certificate”). On August 1, 2022, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company issued 1,466,666 shares of Series A, representing 100 % of the authorized Series A shares, to Pepsi for stated cash consideration aggregating $ 550 million, excluding issuance costs. The Series A was issued concurrently with the execution of Distribution Agreement and the Transition Agreement. The Company determined that the aggregate fair value of the Series A on the issuance date was $ 832.5 million, or approximately $ 568 per share. Accordingly, the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock was recorded at that amount, net of issuance costs of $ 8.0 million, in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and statement of changes in stockholders’ equity and mezzanine equity. Mezzanine Classification The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is redeemable in the event of a change in control as defined in the Series A Certificate. S99-3A(2) of the SEC’s Accounting Series Release No. 268 (“ASR 268”) requires preferred securities that are redeemable for cash or other assets to be classified outside of permanent equity if they are redeemable (i) at a fixed or determinable price on a fixed or determinable date, (ii) at the option of the holder, or (iii) upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within the control of the issuer. Preferred securities that are mandatorily redeemable are required to be classified by the issuer as liabilities whereas under ASR 268 guidance an issuer should classify a preferred security whose redemption is contingent on an event not entirely in control of the issuer as mezzanine equity. The Series A is not mandatorily redeemable, however, a change in control is not solely in control of the Company, accordingly, the Company determined that mezzanine treatment is appropriate for the Series A and has presented it as such in our consolidated balance sheets and statement of changes in stockholders’ equity and mezzanine equity, as of and for the year ending December 31, 2022. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Pepsi, together with its affiliates, has certain rights and is also subject to various restrictions with respect to the Company’s outstanding common shares on an as-converted basis through purchases of the Company’s Common Stock in the open market and the accumulation of PIK dividends. Additionally, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Pepsi has the right to designate one nominee for election to Company’s board of directors, for so long as Pepsi (together with its affiliates) beneficially owns at least 3,666,665 shares of the Company’s outstanding Common Stock on an as-converted basis. In August of 2022, the Company expanded the number of seats from eight to nine in connection with the election of a Pepsi representative to the Company’s board of directors. Liquidation Preference The Series A ranks, with respect to distribution rights and rights on liquidation, winding-up and dissolution, (i) senior and in priority of payment to the Company’s Common Stock, (ii) on parity with any class or series of capital stock of the Company expressly designated as ranking on parity with the Series A, and (iii) junior to any class or series of capital stock of the Company expressly designated as ranking senior to the Series A. The aggregate liquidation preference of the Series A is $ 550.0 million on December 31, 2022. Voting The Series A confers no voting rights, except as otherwise required by applicable law, and with respect to matters that adversely change the powers, preferences, privileges, rights or restrictions given to the Series A or provided for its benefit, or would result in securities that would be senior to or pari passu with the Series A. As described above, Pepsi does have a contractual right to representation on the Company’s Board of Directors, subject to certain share holdings thresholds. F- 28 Dividends The Series A entitles the holder to cumulative dividends, which are payable quarterly in arrears either in cash, in-kind, or a combination thereof, at the Company’s election. Regular Series A Dividends accrue on each share Series A at the rate of 5.00 % per annum, subject to adjustment as set forth in the Series A Certificate. In addition to such quarterly Regular Series A Dividends, shares of Series A also entitle the holder participate in any dividends paid on the Company’s Common Stock on an as-converted basis. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company declared and paid $ 11.5 million in Regular Series A Dividends, which amounted to $ 7.86 per share of Series A. There are no cumulative undeclared dividends on the Series A at December 31, 2022. In addition, there were no dividends issued to common stockholders as of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Redemption Pursuant to certain conditions set forth in the Series A Certificate, Series A may be redeemed at a price per share of Series A equal to the sum of (i) the stated value of such share of Series A as of the applicable Redemption Date, plus (ii) without duplication, all accrued and unpaid dividends previously added to the stated value of such share of Series A, and all accrued and unpaid dividends per share of Series A through such Redemption Date (the “Redemption Price”). Company’s Optional Redemption At any time from and after the earlier of (i) August 1, 2029, if the ten-day volume weighted average price of the Company’s Common Stock (the “Ten-Day VWAP”) does not exceed the conversion price on the date immediately prior to the date the Company delivers a redemption notice to the holders, and (ii) the cancellation of the Distribution Agreement by the Company, if the Ten-Day VWAP does not exceed the Conversion Price on the date immediately prior to the date the Company delivers a redemption notice to the holders, the Company shall have the right to redeem all (and not less than all) of the then-outstanding shares of Series A, at the Redemption Price. In the event of a Company optional redemption, the Company shall affect such redemption by paying the entire Redemption Price on or before the date that is thirty days after the delivery of the Company’s redemption notice and by redeeming all the shares of Series A on such date. Change in Control Redemption In the event of (i) a sale or transfer, directly or indirectly, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company in any transaction or series of related transactions (other than sales in the ordinary course of business); or (ii) any merger, consolidation or reorganization of the Company with or into any other entity or entities as a result of which the holders of the Company’s outstanding capital stock (on a fully-diluted basis) immediately prior to the merger, consolidation or reorganization no longer represent at least a majority of the voting power of the surviving or resulting Company or other entity; or (iii) any sale or series of sales, directly or indirectly, beneficially or of record, of shares of the Company’s capital stock by the holders thereof which results in any Person or group of Affiliated Persons owning capital stock holding more than 50 % of the voting power of the Company (a “Change in Control”) the Company (or its successor) shall redeem all (and not less than all) of the then-issued and outstanding shares of Series A. Upon such redemption, the Company will pay or deliver, as applicable, to each holder in respect of each share of Series A held by such holder, an amount equal to the greater of (A) cash in an amount equal to the Redemption Price and (B) the amount of cash and/or other assets (including securities) such holder would have received had each share of Series A held by such holder as of the close of business on the business day immediately prior to the effective date of such transaction resulting in a Change of Control, converted into a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the then-applicable Conversion Ratio and participated in such transaction resulting in such Change of Control as a holder of shares of Common Stock (such greater amount, the “Change of Control Redemption Price”). If, in connection with a transaction resulting in a Change of Control, the Company or its successor shall not have sufficient funds legally available under the Nevada law governing distributions to stockholders to redeem all outstanding shares of Series A, then the Company shall (A) redeem, pro rata among the holders, a number of shares of Series A equal to the number of shares of Series A that can be redeemed with the maximum amount legally available for the redemption of such shares of Series A under the Nevada law governing distributions to stockholders, and (B) redeem all remaining shares of Series A not redeemed because of the foregoing limitations at the applicable Change of Control Redemption Price as soon as practicable after the Company (or its successor) is able to make such redemption out of assets legally available for the purchase of such share of Series A. The inability of the Company (or its successor) to make a redemption payment for any reason shall not relieve the Company (or its successor) from its obligation to affect any required redemption when, as and if permitted by applicable law. F- 29 Holder Right to Request Redemption On each of August 1, 2029, August 1, 2032, and the August 1, 2035, the majority holders shall have the right, upon no less than six months prior written notice to the Company, to request that the Company redeem all (and not less than all) of the then-outstanding shares of Series A, at the Redemption Price. In the event of a holder optional redemption, the Redemption Price shall be payable, and the shares of Series A redeemed by the Company, in three equal installments, commencing on August 1, 2029, August 1, 2032, or August 1, 2035, as applicable, and in each case on the fifteenth- and thirtieth-month anniversary thereafter (each a “Redemption Date”). On each Redemption Date for a holder optional redemption, the Company shall redeem, on a pro rata basis in accordance with the number of shares of Series A owned by each holder, that number of outstanding shares of Series A determined by dividing (i) the total number of shares of Series A outstanding immediately prior to such Redemption Date by (ii) the number of remaining Redemption Dates (including the Redemption Date to which such calculation applies). If, on any Redemption Date, Nevada law governing distributions to stockholders or the terms of any indebtedness of the Company to banks and other financial institutions engaged in the business of lending money prevent the Company from redeeming all share of Series A to be redeemed, the Company shall ratably redeem the maximum number of shares that it may redeem consistent with such law, and shall redeem the remaining shares as soon as it may lawfully do so under such law. If any shares of Series A scheduled for redemption on a Redemption Date are not redeemed for any reason on such Redemption Date, (x) from such Redemption Date until the fifteen-month anniversary of such Redemption Date, the dividend rate with respect to such unredeemed share of Series A shall automatically increase to 8 % per annum, (y) from such fifteenth-month anniversary of such Redemption Date until the thirtieth-month anniversary of such Redemption Date, the dividend rate with respect to such unredeemed share of Series A shall automatically increase to 10 % per annum and (z) from and after such thirtieth-month anniversary of such Redemption Date, the dividend rate with respect to any such unredeemed share of Series A shall automatically increase to 12 % per annum, in each case until such share is duly redeemed or converted. Conversion The shares of Series A may be converted into shares of the Company’s Common Stock pursuant to the Series A Certificate either at the option of the Company or subject to an automatic conversion as discussed below. The Series A was issued with a conversion price of $75 which is potentially subject to adjustment pursuant to the Series A Certificate. The Conversion Ratio is calculated as the quotient of (a) the sum of (x) the stated value of such share of Series A as of the applicable conversion date, plus (y) of all accrued and unpaid dividends previously added to the stated value of such share of Series A, and without duplication, all accrued and unpaid dividends per share of Series A through the applicable conversion date; divided by (b) the conversion Price as of the conversion date. As of December 31, 2022, the conversion ratio of the Series A into common was 1 to 5 . At December 31, 2022, 7,333,330 shares of the Company’s Common Stock are issuable upon conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. The calculations of earnings per share for all periods presented herein during which the Series A was outstanding do not treat conversion of the Series A as if it had occurred, as the effect of conversion would be anti-dilutive. Company Optional Conversion At any time from and after August 1, 2029, provided the Ten-Day VWAP immediately prior to the date the Company delivers a conversion notice to the holders of Series A exceeds the Conversion Price, the Company may elect to convert all, but not less than all, of the outstanding shares of Series A into shares of the Company’s Common Stock. F- 30 Automatic Conversion The Series A will convert automatically into shares of the Company’s Common Stock upon the occurrence of any of the following, each, an “Automatic Conversion Event”: As of December 31, 2022, the Series A is not probable of becoming redeemable as the most likely method of settlement is through conversion which is likely to occur before the holder right to request redemption becomes exercisable. Other Accounting Matters The Company has adopted Accounting Standards Update 2020-06 (“ASU 2020-06”), effective January 1, 2022. The provisions of ASU 2020-06 prohibit the recognition of a beneficial conversion feature (“BCF”) on preferred shares issued after the adoption of the ASU. The Company adopted ASU 2020-06d for the Preferred Series A for the year ended December 31, 2022. FASB ASC 815 generally requires an analysis of embedded terms and features that have characteristics of derivatives to be evaluated for bifurcation and separate accounting in instances where their economic risks and characteristics are not clearly and closely related to the risks of the host contract. We performed an evaluation and determined the Series A and the host instrument is more akin to equity. The Company identified certain embedded redemption and conversion features which it evaluated for bifurcation and determined no bifurcation of these embedded or conversion features was required. F- 31 Issuance of common stock pursuant to incentive stock plan exercises During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company issued an aggregate of approximately 1.5 million shares of its common stock pursuant to the exercise of stock options granted under the 2015 Plan. The Company received aggregate proceeds of $ 3.7 million for approximately 1.0 million options exercised for cash, with the balance of the options having been exercised on a “cashless” basis. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company issued an aggregate of approximately 1.5 million shares of its common stock pursuant to the exercise of stock options granted under the 2015 Plan and 2006 Incentive Plan (collectively, the “Stock Incentive Plans”). The Company received aggregate proceeds of $ 3.7 million for approximately 1.0 million options exercised for cash, with the balance of the grants having been exercised on a “cashless” basis. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company issued an aggregate of approximately 1.9 million shares of its common stock pursuant to the exercise of stock options granted under the Company’s Stock Incentive Plans. The Company received aggregate proceeds of $ 4.1 million for approximately 1.3 million options exercised for cash, with the balance of the options having been exercised on a “cashless” basis. June 2021 Public Offering On June 9, 2021, the Company and certain selling stockholders (the “Selling Stockholders”) entered into an underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with UBS Securities LLC and Jefferies LLC, as representatives (the “Representatives”) of the several underwriters (the “Underwriters”), relating to the sale of 6,518,267 shares of common stock, par value $ 0.001 per share, of the Company at a public offering price of $ 62.50 per share less underwriting discounts and commissions in a registered public offering (the “Offering”). The Company and certain Selling Stockholders also granted the Underwriters an option, exercisable for 30 days, to purchase up to an additional 977,740 shares of its common stock. The Underwriters partially exercised their option to purchase 873,141 shares of the Company’s common stock on June 11, 2021; 1,133,953 of which were sold by the Company and 739,188 of which were sold by certain of the Selling Stockholders. The Offering closed on June 14, 2021. The Company issued and sold 1,133,953 shares of common stock, and the Selling Stockholders sold 6,257,455 shares, in the aggregate, of common stock in the Offering. The Offering generated net proceeds for the Company of $ 67,769,386 and net proceeds for the Selling Stockholders of $ 375,447,300 . The Company intends to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the Selling Stockholders. F- 32 ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally, ASC 820 requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized below: The Company engaged a third-party valuation provider to assist in determining the fair value of the 1,466,666 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock issued on August 1, 2022. The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is classified in mezzanine equity, see Note 14, Mezzanine Equity, and the valuation of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock represents a non-recurring fair value measurement. We used a Monte Carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock on August 1, 2022. The Monte Carlo simulation utilized multiple input variables to determine the value of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock including a volatility rate of 45 % , risk free interest rate of 2.69 % , 5.0 % dividend rate, the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the issuance date of $ 98.87 , a debt discount rate of 12.5 % and a discount for lack of marketability attributed to the registration period of the underlying stock. The selected historical volatility was based on Celsius and a certain peer group. The risk-free interest rate was based on the US STRIPS Rate with a corresponding term as of issuance date. The 5.0 % dividend rate is consistent with the provisions of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and with the Company’s past payments made in cash. The debt discount rate was based on estimated credit analysis and corresponding market yields as of the issuance date. The Company applied a nominal discount for lack of marketability with respect to the assumed registration period of the underlying shares. The Company used the relief from royalty method model to determine the fair value of the Brand Name during the year ended December 31, 2022. The fundamental concept underlying this method is that in lieu of ownership, the acquirer can obtain comparable rights to use the subject asset via a license from a hypothetical third-party owner. The Relief from Royalty method utilized multiple input variables to determine the value of the Brand Name including forecasted sales, discount rate, and royalty rates. The selected royalty rate was based on comparable brands. The debt discount rate was based on an expected debt and equity rate of return as of September 30, 2022. The following is a tabular presentation of the non-recurring fair value measurement along with the level within the fair value hierarchy at December 31, 2022: Other than those noted in previous notes, the Company did not have any other non-recurring assets or liabilities measured at fair value at December 31, 2022 and 2021. F- 33 The domestic and foreign components of the Company’s income before provision for income taxes are as follows: The provision (benefit) for income taxes consists of the following: The reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory rate to the Company’s effective rate on income before provision (benefit) for income taxes is as follows: The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act introduced a provision to tax global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) of foreign subsidiaries and a measure to tax certain intercompany payments under the base erosion anti-abuse tax “BEAT” regime. For the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, the Company did not generate intercompany transactions that met the BEAT threshold but does have to include GILTI relating to the Company’s foreign subsidiaries. The Company elected to account for GILTI as a current period cost. F- 34 Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts for income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following: At December 31, 2022, the Company has approximately $ 2.3 million of Federal net operating loss carryforwards and $ 8.7 million of state net operating loss carryforwards, which will begin to expire in 2027. The Federal and State NOLs are subject to limitation under Section 382 due to a December 2008 ownership change of greater than 50 % over a three-year testing period. The ownership change resulted in approximately $ 4.5 million of NOLs that will not be realized. The $ 4.5 million has been removed from the available NOL carryforward and US NOL deferred tax asset. The Company had foreign NOL carryforwards of approximately $ 21.9 million, some of which will begin to expire in 2023. The Company considers the earnings of its foreign entities to be permanently reinvested outside the United States based on estimates that future cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs. Accordingly, deferred taxes have not been recorded for the undistributed earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries. All other outside basis differences not related to earnings were impractical to account for at this period of time and are currently considered as being permanent in duration. As required by the authoritative guidance on accounting for income taxes, the Company evaluates the realizability of deferred tax assets on a jurisdictional basis at each reporting date. Accounting for income taxes requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred taxes will not be realized. In circumstances where there is sufficient negative evidence indicating that the deferred tax assets are not more likely than not realizable, the Company establishes a valuation allowance. Through the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company maintained a full valuation allowance on its worldwide net deferred tax assets. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company concluded that it is more likely than not that its US deferred tax assets would be realized. This conclusion was based on the US profitability and NOL utilization in 2021 and 2020 as well as future forecasts of US profitability. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company released its US valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of approximately $ 6.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company reported a release of non-U.S. valuation of $ 0.5 million. The Company continues to maintain a valuation allowance on its foreign net operating losses as it is not more likely than not that the losses in those specific jurisdictions will be realized. F- 35 A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: The Company recognizes only those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold and establishes tax reserves for uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold. To the extent these unrecognized tax benefits are ultimately recognized, approximately $ 0.7 million will impact the Company’s effective tax rate in future periods. Interest and penalties associated with income tax matters are included in the provision for income taxes. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had uncertain tax positions of approximately $ 0.8 million, inclusive of $ 0.1 million of interest and penalties. The Company files U.S., state, and foreign income tax returns in jurisdictions with various statutes of limitations. Below is a summary of the filing jurisdictions and open tax years: F- 36 The Company adopted the 2006 Incentive Stock Plan on January 18, 2007. This plan was intended to provide incentives to attract and retain highly competent persons at all levels as employees of the Company, as well as independent contractors providing consulting or advisory services to the Company, by providing them opportunities to acquire the Company’s common stock. While the plan terminated 10 years after the adoption date, issued awards have their own schedule of terminations. As such, the Company is no longer granting awards under this plan and there are no unvested awards as of December 31, 2022. The Company adopted the 2015 Plan on April 30, 2015. The 2015 Plan is intended to provide incentives which will attract and retain highly competent persons at all levels as employees of the Company, as well as independent contractors providing consulting or advisory services to the Company, by providing them opportunities to acquire the Company’s common stock or to receive monetary payments based on the value of such shares pursuant to awards issued. The 2015 Plan permits the grant of options and shares for up to 5 million shares. In addition, there is a provision in the 2015 Plan for an annual increase to the maximum number of shares authorized under the 2015 Plan, which increase shall be added on the first day of the calendar year beginning January 1, 2016, equal to 15% of the number of shares outstanding as of such date (Note 15). Provisions have been made to permit the grant of options and other share-based awards for up to 5.0 million shares. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Company recognized non-cash compensation expense of approximately $ 20.7 million, $ 36.5 million, and $ 6.3 million respectively, (included in General and administrative expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations). Stock Options The Company used straight-line amortization of compensation expense over the two to three-year requisite service or vesting period of the grant. The maximum contractual term of the Company’s stock options is 10 years. The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur. There are options to purchase approximately 1.9 million shares that have vested as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Under the 2015 Plan, the Company has issued stock options to purchase approximately 2.3 million shares at an average price of $ 9.66 with a fair value of $ 213.9 million. No options were issued during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Upon exercise, shares of new common stock are issued by the Company. The Company determines the fair value of restricted stock-based awards based on the market price on the date of grant. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of its stock option awards and warrant issuances and recognizes forfeitures as they occur. This model uses an exercise price, dividend yields, risk-free interest rate, and expected annual volatility, as inputs. The calculation of the fair value of the awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model is affected by the Company’s stock price on the date of grant as well as assumptions regarding the following: F- 37 The expected volatility was determined with reference to the historical volatility of the Company’s stock. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination within the valuation model. The expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury rate in effect at the time of grant. A summary of the status of the Company’s outstanding stock options as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and changes during the periods ended on that date is as follows: The following table summarizes information about employee stock options outstanding at December 31, 2022: As of December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately $ 3.4 million of unrecognized pre-tax non-cash compensation expense related to options to purchase shares, which the Company expects to recognize, based on a weighted-average period of 1.0 year. F- 38 Restricted Stock Awards Restricted stock awards are awards of common stock that are subject to restrictions on transfer and to a risk of forfeiture if the holder leaves the Company before the restrictions lapse. The holders of a restricted stock award are generally entitled after the release to transact and obtain the same rights as rights of a stockholder of the Company, including the right to vote the shares. The holders of unvested restricted stock awards do not have the same rights as stockholders including but not limited to any dividends which may be declared by the Company, and do not have the right to vote. The value of restricted stock awards that vest over time is established by the market price on the date of its grant and generally vests over a period of 3 years. A summary of the Company’s restricted stock activity for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is presented in the following table: There were no shares granted, vested or outstanding during and as of the year ended December 31, 2022. Restricted Stock Units Restricted stock units are awards that give the holder the right to receive one share of common stock for each restricted stock unit upon meeting service-based vesting conditions (typically annual vesting in three equal annual installments, with a requirement that the holder remains in the continuous employment of the Company). The holders of unvested units do not have the same rights as stockholders including but not limited to any dividends which may be declared by the Company, and do not have the right to vote. The value of restricted stock units that vest over time is established by the market price on the date of its grant. A summary of the Company’s restricted stock unit activity for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is presented in the following table: The total fair value of shares vested during the year ended December 31, 2022, was approximately $ 11.6 million. Unrecognized compensation expense related to outstanding restricted stock units to employees and directors as of December 31, 2022 was approximately $ 20.3 million and is expected to be expensed over the next 2.0 years. F- 39 Performance-based Stock Awards The Company issues stock-based awards to third-party consultants for providing marketing, sales, and general business development services related to Celsius products, as well as to certain employees as discussed below. The stock-based awards are in the form of restricted stock units with performance vesting conditions (“performance stock units” or “PSUs”). The holders of unvested PSUs do not have the same rights as stockholders including but not limited to any dividends which may be declared by the Company, and do not have the right to vote. Some of the PSU performance vesting conditions are linked to the consultants obtaining specified incremental earnings for the Company in a given year over the performance vesting period, typically five years and some of the awards are linked to employees of the Company and have specific performance-based metrics to be met in year one and year two of the issuance as discussed below. The fair value of PSUs is based on the market price of the underlying stock on the grant date. The Company recognizes compensation cost for performance stock awards issued to non-employees in the same manner and periods as though cash had been paid for services received. In the third quarter of 2022, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved the issuance of PSUs to certain employees which represented restricted stock units with performance-based vesting. The aggregate grant date fair value of $ 7.5 million included an immediate vesting of 20 % of the shares as well as specific performance-based metrics to be met in year one and year two of the issuance. The Company believes the performance-based metrics are probable of being achieved and will recognize expense each tranche of the awards separately according to ASC 718. A summary of the Company’s PSU activity for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is presented in the following table: Unrecognized compensation expense related to outstanding PSUs issued to employees and non-employee consultants as of December 31, 2022, was approximately $ 4.3 million and is expected to be expensed over the next 1.6 years. Modifications There were certain Board of Directors members and employees whose service was terminated during 2021. In connection with their terminations, the vesting conditions of the previously granted awards were modified to accelerate the vesting of specified un-vested awards pursuant to Board resolutions or severance agreements. Pursuant ASC 718, these were modifications which required re-valuation of un-vested awards to modification date fair value with recognition of compensation expense over the remaining service period. The Company modified awards resulting in approximately $ 19.3 million in incremental compensation cost during the year ended December 31, 2021. F- 40 Legal In November of 2020, McGovern Capital, Inc. and Kevin McGovern (collectively “McGovern”) filed a claim in arbitration related to its Representative Agreement with the Company as amended by the first amendment dated August 6, 2016. Pursuant to the Representative Agreement, McGovern is entitled to receive a fee of three percent ( 3 %) of “Net Revenues” received by the Company from sales of the Company’s products in the People’s Republic of China for a period of four years from Initial Commercial Sale (which was September 1, 2017). “Net Revenues” are defined in the Representative Agreement as “the Company’s revenues net of actual discounts applied, credits and returns.” Effective January 1, 2019, the Company restructured its China operations from a distribution arrangement with Qifeng Food Technology (Beijing) Co. Ltd. (“Qifeng”), to a license and royalty arrangement and a loan, pursuant to which Qifeng will market and distribute the Company’s products in China, and the Company will receive an annual royalty payment. The Company intended to pay McGovern its percentage of the annual royalty payment, but McGovern had objected, claiming that McGovern is entitled to be paid commissions on the entire royalty payment and the amount of the loan to Qifeng. During the year ended December 31, 2022, a confidential settlement agreement was signed for an amount included in the consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income for year ended December 31, 2022 that is not material to the financial results of the Company. In March of 2019, Daniel Prescod filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company in the Superior Court for the State of California, County of Los Angeles, filed on March 19, 2019, (the “Prescod Litigation”). Daniel Prescod asserts that the Company’s use of citric acid in its products while simultaneously claiming “no preservatives” violates California Consumer Legal Remedies Act, California Business and Professions Code Section 17200, et seq., and California Business and Professions Code Section 17500, et seq., because citric acid acts as a preservative. The Company does not use citric acid as a preservative in its products, but rather as a flavoring, and therefore it believes that its “no preservatives” claim is fair and not deceptive. A motion to certify the case as a class action was filed and on August 2, 2021, that motion was granted. No fact discovery was conducted on the merits. On October 12, 2022, the Company and Mr. Prescod notified the courts that an agreement in principle to settle had been reached to resolve the case for an aggregate amount of $ 7.8 million. The Company and Mr. Prescod submitted the settlement agreement to the court, which entered its preliminary approval on November 23, 2022 and set a final Fairness Hearing for March 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2022, $ 7.8 million was accrued and included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets. On November 23, 2021, a case related to the Prescod Litigation, Amit Heli and Joseph Nina v. Celsius Holdings, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Case No. 1:21-cv-09892. The Company answered the complaint on February 11, 2022. Like the Prescod Litigation, the plaintiffs in this case allege that the Company’s use of citric acid in its products while simultaneously claiming “no preservatives” constitutes false advertising and unfair or deceptive trade practices. Unlike the Prescod Litigation, in this case the violations alleged are of New York’s General Business Law. As with the Prescod Litigation, the Company does not use citric acid as a preservative in its products, but rather as a flavoring, and therefore it believes that its “no preservatives” claim is fair and not deceptive. No discovery has been conducted and this matter is still in its initial stages. On October 12, 2022, the Company and Mr. Prescod notified the courts that an agreement in principle to settle had been reached to resolve the Prescod and Heli case for an aggregate amount of $ 7.8 million. The Company and Mr. Prescod submitted the settlement agreement to the court, which entered its preliminary approval on November 23, 2022 and set a final Fairness Hearing for March 31, 2023 for judicial approval and await final judgment and entry in the coming weeks. As of December 31, 2022, $ 7.8 million was accrued and included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets. F- 41 On January 8, 2021, the Company received a letter from the SEC Division of Enforcement seeking the production of documents in connection with a non-public fact-finding inquiry by the SEC to determine whether violations of the federal securities laws have occurred. Subsequent to January 8, 2021, the Company received subpoenas for production of documents in connection with the matter. The investigation and requests from the SEC do not represent that the SEC has concluded that the Company or anyone else has violated the federal securities laws. The Company has cooperated and will continue to cooperate with the SEC staff in its investigation and requests. At this time, however, the Company cannot predict the length, scope, or results of the investigation or the impact, if any, of the investigation on our results of operations. On March 16, 2022, Christian McCallion filed a class action lawsuit against the Company in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. Plaintiff McCallion asserts that because of the Company’s delay in filing its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, there was a decline in the market value of the Company’s securities and as a result, class members suffered significant losses and damages. On June 6, 2022 Judge Middlebrooks appointed a lead class plaintiff and the Company filed its Motion to Dismiss on August 5, 2022. As the Company has previously disclosed in its periodic reports filed with the SEC, prior to filing an application for an automatic fifteen (15) day extension of the original filing date, the Company experienced staffing limitations, unanticipated delays and identified material errors in previous filings. The Company does not believe it has committed any federal securities violations or made false and/or misleading statements and/or material omissions as alleged in the complaint. The Company intends to contest the claims vigorously on the merits. On January 11, 2023, Doreen R. Lampert filed a derivative stockholder complaint against certain of the Company’s directors and a former officer and, nominally, against the Company, in the United Stated District Court of the District of Nevada. Plaintiff Lampert asserts that the same allegations giving rise to the McCallion class action lawsuit also support claims for breach of fiduciary duty against the directors and former officer, among other claims. The deadline to respond to the complaint will be March 21, 2023. The Company does not believe its directors or former officer have breached any fiduciary duties or are otherwise liable under the theories plead in the complaint and the Company intends to contest the claims. On May 4, 2021, Plaintiffs Strong Arm Productions USA, Inc., Tramar Dillard p/k/a Flo Rida, and D3M Licensing Group, LLC filed a lawsuit against the Company in the Circuit Court of the 17th Judicial Circuit in and for Broward County, Florida. Plaintiffs asserted that the Company breached two endorsement and licensing agreements that were entered into between Plaintiffs and the Company in 2014 and 2016. Plaintiffs alleged the Company had reached certain revenue and sales benchmarks set forth in the 2014 agreement that entitled them to receive 750,000 shares of the Company’s stock. In addition, Plaintiffs claimed they were entitled to receive unspecified royalties under the 2016 agreement. A jury trial commenced on this matter on January 10, 2023. On January 18, 2023, the jury rendered a verdict against the Company for $ 82.6 million in compensatory damages. On February 2, 2023, the Company filed post-trial motions seeking (i) judgment in favor of the Company dismissing the case notwithstanding the verdict based on the plain language of the contracts at issue; (ii) in the alternative, granting a new trial due to the numerous errors at trial; or (iii) in the alternative, reducing the award of damages to $ 2.1 million, which reflects the Company’s stock price on the date that the jury found the relevant revenue and sales benchmarks at issue were met. The judgment will accrue post-judgement interest at 5.52 percent per year as of February 13, 2023 We believe that the jury verdict is not supported by the facts of the case or applicable law, is the result of significant trial error, and there are strong grounds for appeal. We will seek to overturn the verdict in post-trial motions before the trial court and the Company filed a notice of appeal to the Fourth District Court of Appeal for the State of Florida on February 21, 2023. The appeal is suspended pending disposition of the pending post-trial motions. We intend to vigorously challenge the judgment through all appropriate post-trial motions and appeal processes. F- 42 As a result, we believe that the likelihood that the amount of the judgment will be affirmed is not probable. We have taken into consideration the events that have occurred after the reporting period and before the financial statements were issued. We currently estimate a range of possible outcomes between $ 2.1 million and $ 82.6 million, and we have accrued a liability as of December 31, 2022 at the lower end of the range, which is the amount we believe is the most likely estimate for a probable loss on this matter. This amount is reflected in Accounts payable and accrued expenses, and General and administrative expenses in our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. The ultimate loss to the Company of the litigation matter could be materially different from the amount the Company has accrued. The Company cannot predict or estimate the duration or ultimate outcome of this matter. In addition to the foregoing, from time to time, we may become party to litigation or other legal proceedings that we consider to be a part of the ordinary course of our business. Commitments The Company has entered into distribution agreements with liquidated damages in case the Company cancels the distribution agreements without cause. Cause has been defined in various ways. If management makes the decision to terminate an agreement without cause, an estimate of expected damages is accrued, and an expense is recorded within operating expenses during the period in which termination was initiated. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we have contingent commitment to third parties of $ 30.7 million. Our contingent commitments are primarily related to third party suppliers and have arisen through the normal course of business. The contingent commitments may have various terms, and none are individually significant. Additionally, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by the business and economic uncertainty resulting from the pandemic and public health crises related to the COVID-19 outbreak, which is affecting the macro-economic environment. The Company evaluates subsequent events and transactions that occur after the balance sheet date up to the date the consolidated financial statements are issued. Except for the matters discussed in Note 19, there were no other subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements. F- 43",0001341766,CELH

Potential Effects of new COVID-19 Variants on the Company’s Business The COVID-19 pandemic has presented and continues to present a substantial public health and economic challenge around the world and is affecting our employees, communities and business operations, as well as the global economy and financial markets. The human and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the measures taken or that may be taken in the future by governments, businesses (including the Company and our suppliers, distributors, co-packers and other service providers) and the public at large to limit new variants could directly and indirectly impact our business and results of operations, including, without limitation, the following: 1 Any of the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including those described above, alone or in combination with others, may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and/or financial condition.

Our Products We seek to combine nutritional science with mainstream beverages by using our proprietary thermogenic (calorie-burning) MetaPlus ® formulation, while fostering the goal of healthier everyday refreshment by being as natural as possible without the artificial preservatives often found in many energy drinks or sodas. CELSIUS ® has no chemical preservatives, aspartame or high fructose corn syrup and is very low in sodium. CELSIUS ® uses good-for-you ingredients and supplements such as green tea (EGCG), ginger, calcium, chromium, B vitamins and vitamin C. CELSIUS ® is sweetened with sucralose, a sugar-derived sweetener that is found in Splenda ® , which makes our functional energy drinks low-calorie and suitable for consumers whose sugar intake is restricted. Each 12 ounce can of CELSIUS ® contains 200 milligrams of caffeine which is comparable to one 12-ounce cup of coffee from the leading coffeehouse. CELSIUS ® calorie-burning functional energy drinks were first introduced to the marketplace in 2005. According to multiple clinical studies we funded, a single serving (12 ounce can) of CELSIUS ® burns 100 to 140 calories by increasing a consumer’s metabolism an average of 12% for up to a three-hour period. In addition, these studies have indicated that drinking a single serving of CELSIUS ® prior to exercising may improve cardiovascular health and fitness and enhance the loss of fat and gain of muscle from exercise. 2 We currently have five functional energy drink lines: CELSIUS® ready-to drink products are packaged in a distinctive 12 ounce sleek can that uses vivid colors in abstract patterns to create a strong on-shelf impact. The cans are sold in various packaging units are designed to provide a clean, crisp and more modern look. In addition to being sugar free, our original ready-to-drink product line is non-GMO, kosher and vegan certified and soy and gluten free. Func Food Group Oyj, a company incorporated under the laws of Finland (""Func Food"") was acquired in October 2019, as a result we acquired the beverages, protein bars, supplements and superfoods marketed and distributed in Finland, Sweden, and Norway. These products are distributed under the FAST, FitFarm and CocoVi brands and which are owned by Func Food. Clinical Studies It is our belief that clinical studies substantiating product claims will become more important as more and more ""alternative"" beverages are marketed with health claims. CELSIUS ® was one of the first functional energy drinks to be launched along with a clinical study. CELSIUS ® is also one of very few functional energy drinks that has clinical research on the actual product itself. Some functional energy drink and supplement companies that do mention studies backing their claims are referencing independent studies conducted on one or more of the ingredients in the product. We believe that it is important and will become more important over time, to have studies on the actual product. We have funded seven U.S. based clinical studies for CELSIUS ® . Each was conducted by a research organization and each studied the total CELSIUS ® formula. The first study was conducted by the Ohio Research Group of Exercise Science & Sports Nutrition. The remaining studies were conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of the University of Oklahoma. We funded all of the studies and provided CELSIUS ® functional energy drinks for the studies. However, none of our directors, executive officers or principal stockholders is in any way affiliated with either of the two research organizations which conducted the studies. The first study was conducted in 2005 by the Ohio Research Group of Exercise Science & Sports Nutrition www.ohioresearchgroup.com. The Ohio Research Group of Exercise Science & Sports Nutrition is a multidisciplinary clinical research team dedicated to exploring the relationship between exercise, nutrition, dietary supplements and health. This placebo-controlled, double-blind cross-over study compared the effects of CELSIUS ® and the placebo on metabolic rate. Twenty-two participants were randomly assigned to ingest a 12-ounce serving of CELSIUS ® and on a separate day a serving of twelve ounces of Diet Coke ® . All subjects completed both trials using a randomized, counterbalanced design. Randomized means that subjects were selected for each group randomly to ensure that the different treatments were statistically equivalent. Counterbalancing means that individuals in one group drank the placebo on the first day and drank CELSIUS ® on the second day. The other group did the opposite. Counterbalancing is a design method that is used to control “order effects.” In other words, this was done to make sure that the order that subjects were served does not impact the results and analysis. Metabolic rate (via indirect calorimetry, measurements taken from breaths into and out of calorimeter) and substrate oxidation (via respiratory exchange ratios) were measured at baseline (pre-ingestion) and for ten minutes at the end of each hour for three hours post-ingestion. The results showed an average increase of metabolism of twelve percent over the three-hour period, compared to a statistically insignificant change for the control group. Metabolic rate, or metabolism, is the rate at which the body expends energy. This is also referred to as the “caloric burn rate.” Indirect calorimetry calculates heat that living organisms produce from their production of carbon dioxide. It is called “indirect” because the caloric burn rate is calculated from a measurement of oxygen uptake. Direct calorimetry would involve the subject being placed inside the calorimeter for the measurement to determine the heat being produced. Respiratory Exchange Ratio is the ratio oxygen taken in a breath compared to the carbon dioxide breathed out in one breath or exchange. Measuring this ratio can be used for estimating which substrate (fuel such as carbohydrate or fat) is being metabolized or ‘oxidized’ to supply the body with energy. The second study was conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2007. This blinded, placebo-controlled study was conducted on a total of 60 men and women of normal weight. An equal number of participants were separated into two groups to compare one serving (a single 12 ounce can) of CELSIUS ® to a placebo of the same amount. According to the study, those subjects consuming CELSIUS ® burned significantly more calories versus those consuming the placebo, over a three-hour period. The study confirmed that over the three-hour period, subjects consuming a single serving of CELSIUS ® burned 65% more calories than those consuming the placebo drink and burned an average of more than 100 to 140 calories compared to the placebo. These results were statistically significant. 3 The third study, conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2007, extended our second study with the same group of 60 individuals and protocol for 28 days and showed the same statistical significance of increased calorie burn (minimal attenuation). While the University of Oklahoma study did extend for 28 days, more testing would be needed for long term analysis of the CELSIUS ® calorie-burning effects. Also, although these studies were on relatively small numbers of subjects, they have statistically significant results. Additional studies on a larger number and wider range of body compositions can be considered to further the analysis. The fourth study, conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2009, combined CELSIUS ® use with exercise. This ten-week placebo-controlled, randomized and blinded study was conducted on a total of 37 subjects. Participants were randomly assigned into one of two groups: Group 1 consumed one serving of CELSIUS ® per day, and Group 2 consumed one serving of an identically flavored and labeled placebo beverage. Both groups participated in ten weeks of combined aerobic and weight training, following the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines of training for previously sedentary adults. The results showed that consuming a single serving of CELSIUS ® prior to exercising may enhance the positive adaptations of exercise on body composition, cardio-respiratory fitness and endurance performance. According to the preliminary findings, subjects consuming a single serving of CELSIUS ® lost significantly more fat mass and gained significantly more muscle mass than those subjects consuming the placebo — a 93.75% greater loss in fat and 50% greater gain in muscle mass, respectively. The study also confirmed that subjects consuming CELSIUS ® significantly improved measures of cardio-respiratory fitness and the ability to delay the onset of fatigue when exercising to exhaustion. The fifth study was conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2009. This ten-week placebo-controlled, randomized and blinded study was conducted on a total of 27 previously sedentary overweight and obese female subjects. Participants were randomly assigned into groups that consumed identically tasting treatment drinks with exercise or without exercise. All participants consumed one drink, either placebo or CELSIUS ® , per day for 10 weeks. The exercise groups participated in ten weeks of combined aerobic and weight training, following the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines of training for previously sedentary adults. No changes were made to their diet. The results showed that consuming a single serving of CELSIUS ® prior to exercising may improve cardiovascular health and fitness and enhance the positive adaptations of exercise on body composition. According to the preliminary findings, subjects consuming a single serving of CELSIUS ® lost significantly more fat mass and gained significantly more muscle mass when compared to exercise alone — a 46% greater loss in fat, 27% greater gain in muscle mass, respectively. The study also confirmed that subjects consuming CELSIUS ® significantly improved measures of cardio-respiratory fitness — 35% greater endurance performance with significant improvements to lipid profiles — total cholesterol decreases of 5 to 13% and bad LDL cholesterol 12 to 18%. Exercise alone had no effect on blood lipid levels. The sixth study was conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2009. This ten-week placebo-controlled, randomized and blinded study was conducted on a total of 37 previously sedentary male subjects. Participants were randomly assigned into groups that consumed identically tasting treatment drinks with exercise or without exercise. All participants consumed one drink, either placebo or CELSIUS ® , per day for 10 weeks. The exercise groups participated in ten weeks of combined aerobic and weight training, following the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines of training for previously sedentary adults. No changes were made to their diet. The results showed that consuming a single serving of CELSIUS ® prior to exercising may improve cardiovascular health and fitness and enhance the positive adaptations of exercise on body composition. Significantly greater decreases in fat mass and percentage body fat and increases in VO 2 were observed in the subjects that consumed CELSIUS ® before exercise versus those that consumed the placebo before exercise. Mood was not affected. Clinical markers for hepatic, renal, cardiovascular and immune function, as determined by pre-and post-blood work revealed no adverse effects. Our seventh study was conducted by Miami Research Institute in 2010 and demonstrated the efficacy and safety of the powders and the shots. This study allows the Company to make the same structure/function claims as its ready to drink products. Manufacture and Supply of Our Products Our functional energy drinks and supplements are produced by established third party beverage co-packers. A co-packer is a manufacturing plant that provides the service of filling bottles or cans for the brand owner. Utilizing co-packers allows us produce in multiple locations strategically placed throughout the country. We purchase most of the ingredients and all packaging materials. The co-pack facility assembles our products and charges us a fee by the case. The shelf life of CELSIUS® products is specified as 15 to 18 months. Substantially all of the raw materials used in the preparation, bottling and packaging of our products are purchased by us or by our co-packers in accordance with our specifications. Generally, we obtain the ingredients used in our products from domestic suppliers and some ingredients have several reliable suppliers. The ingredients in CELSIUS ® include green tea (EGCG), ginger (from the root), caffeine, B vitamins, vitamin C, taurine, guarana, chromium, calcium, glucuronolactone, sucralose, natural flavors and natural colorings. We have no major supply contracts with any of our suppliers. For certain ingredients, there are limited suppliers. In case of a supply restriction or interruption from any of the flavor and coloring suppliers, we would have to test and qualify other suppliers, which may disrupt our production schedules. Packaging materials are available from multiple sources in the United States. While the beverage industry has experienced some shortages of cans as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been able to secure adequate supply and have not experienced significant adverse effects from such shortages. We believe that our co-packing arrangements and supply sources are adequate for our present needs. Func Food similarly has its FAST and other products manufactured by independent third parties in the Nordic countries. Distribution Domestic In the United States and elsewhere in North America, CELSIUS ® is sold across many retail segments. They include supermarkets, convenience stores, drug stores, nutritional stores, and mass merchants. We also sell to health clubs, gyms, the military, and e-commerce websites. 4 We distribute our products domestically through direct-store delivery (DSD), distributors as well as sales direct to retailers (DTR). Our products are also sold online through e-commerce platforms such as Amazon and Walmart.com. Pepsi. Distribution Agreement On August 1, 2022, we entered into the Distribution Agreement relating to the sale and distribution of certain of the Company’s beverage products in existing channels and distribution methods in the United States, excluding certain existing customer accounts, sales channels, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands (the “Territory”). Under the Distribution Agreement, the Company granted Pepsi the right to sell and distribute its existing beverage products in existing channels and distribution methods and future beverage products that are added from time to time as licensed products under the Distribution Agreement in defined territories. The Distribution Agreement represents a master service agreement and can be cancelled by either party in accordance with the terms of the Distribution Agreement without cause in the nineteenth year of the term (i.e., 2041), the twenty-ninth year of the term (i.e., 2051) and each ten (10) year period thereafter (i.e., 2061, 2071, etc.) by providing twelve (12) months’ written notice on August 1st of each such year to the other party. Except for a termination by the Company “with cause” or a termination by Pepsi “without cause”, the Company is required to pay Pepsi certain compensation upon a termination as specified in the Distribution Agreement. The Company agreed to provide Pepsi a right of first offer in the event the Company intends to (i) manufacture, distribute or sell products in certain additional countries as specified in the Distribution Agreement or (ii) distribute or sell products in any future channels and distribution methods during the term of the Distribution Agreement. Additionally, pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, the Company and Pepsi agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate and execute with Pepsi a distribution agreement reasonably consistent with the Distribution Agreement for the sale and distribution of the products in Canada, and Pepsi agreed to meet and confer in good faith with the Company regarding the terms and conditions upon which Pepsi may be willing to sell or distribute products, either directly or through local sub-distributors in certain other additional countries. The Distribution Agreement includes other customary provisions, including non-competition covenants in favor of the Company, representations and warranties, indemnification provisions, insurance provisions and confidentiality provisions. In connection with the Distribution Agreement the Company and Pepsi also executed a Channel Transition Agreement, providing for the Company’s transition of certain existing distribution rights in the Territory to Pepsi. International We distribute our products in various foreign regions through regional and country-specific distribution partners. In October 2019, we acquired Func Food, our Nordic distribution partner, who markets both our products as well as other products under its own brands. We market our products in the Asian market through local distributors in Hong Kong and a license agreement with our partner in China, Qifeng Food Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd. (“Qifeng”). While we initially began both local production and preliminary distribution of the CELSIUS ® brand in 2018 through our partnership with Qifeng, effective January 1, 2019, we restructured our China distribution efforts by entering into two separate agreements as it relates to the commercialization of our CELSIUS ® products and a repayment of an investment agreement with Qifeng. Under the license agreement, Qifeng was granted the exclusive license rights to manufacture, market and commercialize CELSIUS ® brand products in China. Qifeng will pay a minimum royalty fee of approximately $6.9 million for the first five years of the term of the agreement, transitioning to a volume-based royalty fee, thereafter and until the licensing agreement is terminated or canceled. Under a separate economic agreement, Qifeng will repay the marketing investments made by CELSIUS ® into the China market through 2018. The repayment, which was formalized via a note receivable from Qifeng, will need to be serviced even if the licensing agreement is cancelled or terminated. With our new partnership with Pepsi, we would expect to utilize the Pepsi system as we develop international expansion plans in future periods. Customer Concentration The following table shows the revenue concentration of our customers accounting for more than 10% of revenue, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020: 2022 2021 2020 Pepsi 22.2 % — — Costco 16.7 % 12.7 % 2.9 % Amazon 8.8 % 10.1 % 15.1 % All other 52.3 % 77.2 % 82.0 % Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 5 The following table shows the accounts receivable concentration accounting for more than 10% of accounts receivables, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: 2022 2021 Pepsi 47.6 % — Amazon 11.8 % 22.7 % Publix 1.4 % 10.3 % All other 39.2 % 67.0 % Total 100.0 % 100.0 % Sales and Marketing We believe that one of the keys to success in the beverage industry is differentiation, by making our brands and products visually appealing and distinctive from other beverages on the shelves of retailers. We review our products and packaging on an ongoing basis and, where practical, endeavor to make them different and unique. The labels and graphics for many of our products are refreshed from time to time to maximize their visibility and identification, wherever they may be placed in stores, which we continue to reevaluate from time to time. Where appropriate, we partner with our distributors, or retailers to assist our marketing efforts. Seasonality of Sales As is typical in the functional energy drink and supplement industries, sales of products are seasonal, with the highest sales volumes generally occurring in the second and third fiscal quarters, which correspond to the warmer months of the year in our major markets, albeit with our recent significant growth, we have seen ongoing quarter over quarter growth regardless of the season. Competition We believe that our CELSIUS ® brand products are one of the few functional energy drink and supplement lines whose effectiveness is supported by clinical studies, which gives us a unique position. However, our products do compete broadly with not only functional energy drinks and supplements, but all categories of liquid refreshments. The functional energy drink, supplement and liquid refreshment markets are highly competitive, and include international, national, regional and local producers and distributors, most of whom have greater financial, management and other resources than us. Our direct competitors in the functional energy drink and supplement markets include, but are not limited to The Coca-Cola Company, Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, Nestlé, Waters North America, Inc., Hansen Natural Corp., Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Monster Energy, and Red Bull. Proprietary Rights We have registered the CELSIUS ® and MetaPlus ® trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, as well as a number of additional trademarks. We have and will continue to take appropriate measures, such as entering into confidentiality agreements with our contract packers and ingredient suppliers, to maintain the secrecy and proprietary nature of our MetaPlus ® formulation and product formulas. We maintain our MetaPlus ® formulation and product formulas as trade secrets. We believe that trade secrecy is a preferable method of protection for our formulas as patenting them might require their disclosure. Other than a company that is our outsourced production manager, no single member of the raw material supply chain or our co-packers has access to the complete formula. We consider our trademarks and trade secrets to be of considerable value and importance to our business. No successful challenges to our registered trademarks have arisen and we have no reason to believe that any such challenges will arise in the future. Government Regulation The production, distribution and sale of our products in the United States is subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act , the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 , the Occupational Safety and Health Act , various environmental statutes and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products. California law requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a component listed by California as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects. The law exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products because the law recognizes no generally applicable quantitative thresholds below which a warning is not required. Consequently, even trace amounts of listed components can expose affected products to the prospect of warning labels. Products containing listed substances that occur naturally in the product or that are contributed to the product solely by a municipal water supply are generally exempt from the warning requirement. While none of our products are required to display warnings under this law, we cannot predict whether an important component of any of our products might be added to the California list in the future. We also are unable to predict whether or to what extent a warning under this law would have an impact on costs or sales of our products. The marketing and sale of our products internationally is similarly subject to compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations in those foreign countries where our products are sold. 6 Compliance with Environmental Laws The facilities of our co-packers in the United States are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to air emissions, the use of water resources and recycling. Our operations in other countries are subject to similar federal, state, local and supranational laws and regulations that may be applicable in such countries. Changes in environmental compliance mandates, and any expenditures necessary to comply with such requirements, could adversely affect our financial performance and future growth. Compliance with these provisions has not had, nor do we expect such compliance to have, any material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, net income or competitive position. Container Deposits Measures have been enacted in various localities and states that require that a deposit be charged for certain non-refillable beverage containers. The precise requirements imposed by these measures vary. We are required to collect deposits from our customers and to remit such deposits to the respective jurisdictions based upon the number of cans and bottles of certain carbonated and non-carbonated products sold in such states. Other deposit, recycling or product stewardship proposals have been introduced in certain states and localities and in Congress, and we anticipate that similar legislation or regulations may be proposed in the future at the local, state and federal levels, both in the United States and elsewhere. Human Capital Resources As of December 31, 2022, the Company employs 378 people including its executive officers, in five different countries. This includes 324 employees in the US, 49 in countries within Europe, and 5 in Hong Kong. Employees We believe people are our most important asset, and we strive to attract and retain high-performing talents. Through comprehensive and competitive compensation and benefits, ongoing employee learning and development, and a focus on health and well-being, we strive to support our employees in all aspects of their lives. We believe we have a talented, motivated and dedicated team, and work to create an inclusive, safe and supportive environment for all team members. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion We believe a culture that celebrates diverse talent, individual identity, and different points of view, empowers employees to contribute new ideas that support our continued and growing success. Women, racial and ethnic minorities collectively constitute a meaningful part of our overall workforce across all levels of our global organization. Culture and Engagement We believe open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an open, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow, and succeed. Team members are encouraged to come to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns. We also encourage regular, live communication across the organization and host quarterly global town halls with our senior leadership. Leadership, Training and Development We focus on investing in inspirational leadership, learning opportunities and capabilities to equip our global workforce with the skills they need while improving engagement and retention. We provide formal and informal learning programs, which are designed to help our employees continuously grow and strengthen their skills throughout their careers. We offer a variety of programs that contribute to our leadership, training and development goals, and comprehensive coaching and mentoring programs that support leadership and employee development. Compensation and Benefits We believe that compensation should be competitive and equitable and should enable employees to share in the Company’s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, we offer a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world and invest in tools and resources that are designed to support employees’ individual growth and development. Our compensation programs are designed to reinforce our growth agenda and our talent strategy as well as to drive a strong connection between the contributions of our employees and their pay. We conduct annual pay equity analyses to help ensure our base pay structures are fair and to identify and address potential issues or disparities and we adjust base pay, where appropriate. Also, as permitted by local law, annually, we perform an adverse impact analysis on base pay, annual incentives, and long-term incentives to help ensure fairness. We provide compensation packages designed to attract and retain talent while maintaining alignment with the market. We believe the structure of our compensation packages provides the appropriate incentives to attract, retain and motivate our employees. Our base pay aligns with employee positions, skill levels, experience, and geographic location. Additionally, we provide competitive employee benefits packages, which vary by country and region. These employee benefits packages may include: employee assistance programs, medical and dental insurance, vision insurance, well-being rewards programs, core and supplemental life insurance, long and short-term disability, accident insurance, critical illness insurance, retirement savings plans, prepaid legal services, healthy rewards programs, identity theft assistance, financial courses and advisors, vacation pay, holiday pay, annual incentive awards, recognition programs, and equity awards for eligible employees. 7 Our Compensation Committee provides oversight of the our policies and strategies relating to talent, leadership, and culture, including diversity, equity and inclusion, as well as the Company’s compensation philosophy and programs. The Compensation Committee also evaluates and approves our compensation plans, policies and programs applicable to our senior executives. In addition, the Compensation Committee oversees succession planning and talent development for our senior executives. We believe that our approach to human capital resources has been instrumental in our growth, and has made us a desirable destination for employees. Information about our Executive Officers The following is a description of the business experience and background of Jarrod Langhans, our Chief Financial Officer, who is our only executive officer who is not a member of our board of directors. Jarrod Langhans , 42, became our Chief Financial Officer in April 2022. Mr. Langhans served as Chief Financial Officer of the European and Israel operating segments of Primo Water Corporation. From July 2012 through May 2020, he has held various executive positions within Primo Water Corporation across the accounting, finance and investor relations areas. Mr. Langhans’ prior experience also includes working for major accounting firms such as CBIZ Mayer Hoffman McCann (MHM) and Cherry Bekaert. He is a Certified Public Accountant in Florida and has an extensive and diversified financial and leadership background across areas such as financial reporting. Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the other information contained in this Report, including in “ Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ” and the consolidated financial statement and notes, you should carefully consider the following risks. The risks and uncertainties discussed below and elsewhere in this Report may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently see as immaterial, may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects . Risk Factors Relating to Our Business Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by new COVID-19 variants COVID-19 has presented and continues to present a substantial public health and economic challenge around the world and is affecting our employees, communities and business operations, as well as the global economy and financial markets. The human and economic consequences of new COVID-19 variants as well as the measures taken or that may be taken in the future by governments, businesses (including the Company and our suppliers, distributors, co-packers and other service providers) and the public at large to limit the spread of new COVID-19 variants, may directly and indirectly impact our business and results of operations, including, without limitation, the following: 8 Any of the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including those described above, alone or in combination with others, may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and/or financial condition. Any of these negative impacts, alone or in combination with others, could exacerbate many of the risk factors discussed herein, any of which could materially affect our business, reputation, operating results and/or financial condition. Consolidation of retailers, wholesalers and distributors in the industry may result in downward pressure on sales prices. Consolidation can cause significant downward pricing pressure and can impose additional costs on us. If we are unable to successfully manage the potential impact of these commercial changes, our financial results may be materially and adversely affected. We rely on third party co-packers to manufacture our products. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our co-packers and/or their ability to manufacture our products becomes constrained or unavailable to us, our business could suffer. We do not directly manufacture our products, but instead outsource such manufacturing to established third party co-packers. These third-party co-packers may not be able to fulfill our demand as it arises, could begin to charge rates that make using their services cost inefficient or may simply not be able to or willing to provide their services to us on a timely basis or at all. In the event of any disruption or delay, whether caused by a rift in our relationship or the inability of our co-packers to manufacture our products as required, we would need to secure the services of alternative co-packers. We may be unable to procure alternative packing facilities at commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time period and any such transition could be costly. In such case, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. We rely on distributors to distribute our products in the DSD sales channel and in international markets. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing distributors, our business could suffer. We distribute CELSIUS ® in the DSD sales channel by entering into agreements with direct-to-store delivery distributors having established sales, marketing and distribution organizations. We similarly are seeking to expand our international distribution, by entering into agreements with large established distributors who service those markets. Many of our distributors are affiliated with and manufacture and/or distribute other beverage products. In many cases, such products compete directly with our products. The marketing efforts of our distributors are important for our success. If CELSIUS ® proves to be less attractive to our distributors and/or if we fail to attract distributors, and/or our distributors do not market and promote our products with greater focus in preference to the products of our competitors, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Our customers are material to our success. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing customers, our business could suffer. Unilateral decisions could be taken by our distributors, grocery chains, convenience chains, drug stores, nutrition stores, mass merchants, club warehouses and other customers to discontinue carrying all or any of our products that they are carrying at any time, which could cause our business to suffer. Increases in cost or shortages of raw materials or increases in costs of co-packing could harm our business . The principal raw materials used by us are flavors and ingredient blends as well as aluminum cans, the prices of which are subject to fluctuations. We are uncertain whether the prices of any of the above or any other raw materials or ingredients we utilize will rise in the future and whether we will be able to pass any of such increases on to our customers. We do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials. In addition, some of these raw materials, such as our sleek 12 ounce can, are available from a limited number of suppliers. As alternative sources of supply may not be available, any interruption in the supply of such raw materials might materially harm us. While the functional energy drink and supplement industries have experienced some shortages of cans as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Celsius has been able to secure adequate supply, though potentially at higher cost. To address the industry-wide shortage of aluminum cans, we have imported cans manufactured abroad which affected our margins in 2021 and 2022. We are unable to accurately predict how these cost trends might evolve prospectively. Such industry-wide shortages of raw materials, including aluminum cans, could from time to time in the future be encountered, which could interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our products and negatively impact our financial performance. 9 Our failure to accurately estimate demand for our products could adversely affect our business and financial results. We may not correctly estimate demand for our existing products and/or new products. Our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise, particularly with regard to new products, and may be less precise during periods of rapid growth, including in new markets. If we materially underestimate demand for our products or are unable to secure sufficient ingredients, flavors, aluminum cans and other raw materials for our supplements or experience difficulties with our co-packing arrangements, including production shortages or quality issues, we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis. Moreover, industry-wide shortages of certain ingredients have occurred and could occur, from time to time in the future, resulting in production fluctuations and/or product shortages. We generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage this risk. Such shortages could interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. If we do not accurately anticipate the future demand for a particular product or the time it will take to obtain new inventory, our inventory levels may be inadequate and our results of operations may be negatively impacted. If we fail to meet our shipping schedules, we could damage our relationships with distributors and/or retailers, increase our distribution costs and/or cause sales opportunities to be delayed or lost. In order to be able to deliver our products on a timely basis, we need to maintain adequate inventory levels of the desired products. If the inventory of our products held by our distributors and/or retailers is too high, they will not place orders for additional products, which could unfavorably impact our future sales and adversely affect our operating results. Changes in the retail landscape or the loss of key retail or food service customers could adversely affect our financial results. Our industry is being affected by the trend toward consolidation in and blurring of the lines between retail channels, particularly in Europe and the United States. Larger retailers may seek lower prices from us, may demand increased marketing or promotional expenditures, and may be more likely to use their distribution networks to introduce and develop private-label brands, any of which could negatively affect our profitability. In addition, discounters and value stores are growing at a rapid pace. Our industry is also being affected by the rapid growth in sales through e-commerce retailers, e-commerce websites, mobile commerce applications and subscription services, which may result in a shift away from physical retail operations to digital channels. As we build our e-commerce capabilities, we may not be able to develop and maintain successful relationships with existing and new e-commerce retailers without experiencing a deterioration of our relationships with key customers operating physical retail channels. If we are unable to successfully adapt to the rapidly changing retail landscape, including the rapid growth in digital commerce, our share of sales, volume growth and overall financial results could be negatively affected. In addition, our success depends in part on our ability to maintain good relationships with key retail customers. The loss of one or more of our key retail customers could have an adverse effect on our financial performance. Significant additional labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products may inhibit sales of affected products. Various jurisdictions may seek to adopt significant additional product labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products as a result of what our products contain or allegations that our products cause adverse health effects. If these types of requirements become applicable to one or more of our products under current or future environmental or health laws or regulations, they may inhibit sales of such products. For example, under one such law in California, known as Proposition 65, if the state has determined that a substance causes cancer or harms human reproduction, a warning must be provided for any product sold in the state that exposes consumers to that substance, unless the exposure falls under an established safe harbor level or another exemption is applicable. If we were required to add Proposition 65 warnings on the labels of one or more of our supplement products produced for sale in California, the resulting consumer reaction to the warnings and possible adverse publicity could negatively affect our sales both in California and in other markets. Our continued expansion outside of the United States exposes us to uncertain conditions and other risks in international markets. We have sales of products internationally in a variety of markets and are currently seeking to expand our international distribution. As our growth strategy includes further expanding our international business, if we are unable to continue to expand distribution of our products outside the United States, our growth rate could be adversely affected. Although we intend to sell through established distributors in international markets, we have limited or no operating experience in many of such markets and it may be costly to promote our brands in international markets. We face and will continue to face substantial risks associated with foreign distribution and sale of our products, including economic and/or political instability in various international markets; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; restrictions on or costs relating to the repatriation of foreign profits to the United States, including possible taxes and/or withholding obligations on any repatriations; and tariffs and/or trade restrictions. These risks could have a significant impact on our ability to distribute and sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, distribution and sale of products outside of the United States are subject to risks relating to appropriate compliance with legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions, potentially higher product damage rates if our products are shipped long distances, potentially higher incidence of fraud and/or corruption, credit risk of distributors and potentially adverse tax consequences. Numerous U.S. and International laws including export and import controls affect our ability to compete in international markets. U.S. export control laws and economic and trade sanctions prohibit the provision of certain products and services to U.S. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments and persons. Even though we take precautions to prevent our products from being shipped or provided to embargoed countries and U.S. sanctions targets, they could be shipped, or provided by our distributors, to those countries and targets despite such precautions. The provision of goods in violation of U.S. export controls and/or sanctions could have negative consequences for our business, including government investigations, penalties and reputational harm. We must also comply with U.S. import laws. U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) also impact our international activities. We are subject to the FCPA and other laws that prohibit improper payments and offers to foreign officials and political parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Selling products into international markets, including through distributors, creates the risk of unauthorized payments or offers, for which we may be held responsible. Violations of the FCPA or 10 other applicable anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, or other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Changes in export and import regulations, economic sanctions and related laws, shifts in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, changes in the countries, governments or persons targeted by such regulations and the imposition of tariffs may create delays in the introduction and sale of our products in international markets, result in decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations or in some cases, prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries, governments or persons. Actions taken with respect to tariffs or trade relations between the United States and other countries, the products subject to such actions, and actions taken by other countries in retaliation may also have an adverse impact on us. The failure to comply with applicable current or future U.S. import, export control, sanctions and anti-corruption laws, including U.S. Customs regulations, could expose us and our employees to substantial civil or criminal penalties, fines and in extreme cases, incarceration. In addition, if our distributors fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re-export licenses or authorizations, or otherwise act in accordance with applicable laws, we may be adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties. Failure to successfully complete or manage strategic transactions can adversely affect our business We regularly review our portfolio of businesses and evaluate potential acquisitions, joint ventures, distribution agreements, divestitures, and other strategic transactions. The success of these transactions, including the recent completion of the strategic transaction with Pepsi, is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to realize the full extent of the expected returns, benefits, cost savings or synergies as a result of a transaction, within the anticipated time frame, or at all; and receipt of necessary consents, clearances and approvals. Risks associated with strategic transactions include integrating manufacturing, distribution, sales, accounting, financial reporting and administrative support activities and information technology systems with our company or difficulties separating such personnel, activities and systems in connection with divestitures; operating through new business models or in new categories or territories; motivating, recruiting and retaining executives and key employees; conforming controls (including internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures) and policies (including with respect to environmental compliance, health and safety compliance and compliance with anti-bribery laws); retaining existing customers and consumers and attracting new customers and consumers; managing tax costs or inefficiencies; maintaining good relations with divested or refranchised businesses in our supply or sales chain; inability to offset loss of revenue associated with divested brands or businesses; managing the impact of business decisions or other actions or omissions of our joint venture partners that may have different interests than we do; and other unanticipated problems or liabilities, such as contingent liabilities and litigation. Strategic transactions that are not successfully completed or managed effectively, or our failure to effectively manage the risks associated with such transactions, could continue to result in adverse effects on our business. If we fail to realize a significant portion of the anticipated benefits of our strategic arrangement with Pepsi, our financial results could be adversely affected. We have a long-term strategic distribution arrangement with Pepsi. If we are unable to successfully manage our relationship with Pepsi, or if for any other reason we fail to realize all or a significant part of the benefits we expect from this strategic relationship, our financial performance could be adversely affected. Global or regional catastrophic events could impact our operations and affect our ability to grow our business. Because of our increasingly global presence, our business could be affected by unstable political conditions, civil unrest, protests and demonstrations, large-scale terrorist acts, especially those directed against the United States or other major industrialized countries where our products are distributed, the outbreak or escalation of armed hostilities, such as the Russian conflict in the Ukraine, major natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, wildfires, tornadoes, earthquakes or floods, or widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases (such as the COVID-19 pandemic). Such catastrophic events could impact our operations and our supply chain, including the production and/or distribution of our products. Materials and/or personnel may need to mobilize to other locations. Our headquarters and a large part of our operations are located in Florida, a state at greater risk of hurricanes. Some of the raw materials we use, including certain sizes of cans, are available from limited suppliers, and a regional catastrophic event impacting such suppliers could adversely impact our operations. In addition, such events could disrupt global or regional economic activity, which could affect consumer purchasing power and consumers’ ability to purchase our products, thereby reducing demand for our products. If our operations are disrupted or we are unable to grow our business as a result of these factors, our growth rate could decline and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Climate change and natural disasters may affect our business. There is concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures due to increased carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. Changing weather patterns could result in decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions, and/or outbreaks of diseases or other health issues, which may limit availability and/or increase the cost of certain ingredients used in our products and could impact the food security of communities around the world. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain and/or impact demand for our products. Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, wildfires, earthquakes or floods, and outbreaks of diseases (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or other health issues may affect our operations and the operation of our supply chain, impact the operations of our distributors and unfavorably impact our consumers’ ability to purchase our products. In addition, public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy, transportation and raw material costs, and may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment. Changes in applicable laws, regulations, standards or practices related to greenhouse gas emissions, packaging and water scarcity, as well as initiatives by advocacy groups in favor of certain climate change-related laws, regulations, standards or practices, may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures and other financial obligations, which could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Sales of our products may also be influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate. Our third-party co-packers use a number of key ingredients in the manufacture of our liquid supplement products and powder packets that are derived from agricultural commodities. Increased demand for food products and decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions of the world as a result of changing weather patterns and other factors may limit the availability or increase the cost of such agricultural commodities and could impact 11 the food security of communities around the world. Weather conditions may influence consumer demand for certain of our supplements, which could have an effect on our operations, either positively or negatively. We depend upon our trademarks and proprietary rights, and any failure to protect our intellectual property rights or any claims that we are infringing upon the rights of others may adversely affect our competitive position. Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to protect our current and future brands and products and to defend our intellectual property rights. We cannot be sure that trademarks will be issued with respect to any future trademark applications or that our competitors will not challenge, invalidate or circumvent any existing or future trademarks issued to, or licensed by, us. Our products are manufactured using our proprietary blends of ingredients. These blends are created by third-party suppliers to our specifications and then supplied to our co-packers. Although all of the third parties in our supply and manufacture chain execute confidentiality agreements, there can be no assurance that our trade secrets, including our proprietary ingredient blends will not become known to competitors. We believe that our competitors, many of whom are more established and have greater financial and personnel resources than we do, may be able to replicate or reverse engineer our processes, brands, flavors, or our products in a manner that could circumvent our protective safeguards. Therefore, we cannot give you any assurance that our confidential business information will remain proprietary. Any such loss of confidentiality could diminish or eliminate any competitive advantage provided by our proprietary information. We must continually maintain, protect and/or upgrade our information technology systems, including protecting us from internal and external cyber-security threats. Information technology enables us to operate efficiently, interface with customers, maintain financial accuracy and efficiency and accurately produce our financial statements. If we do not appropriately allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, and/or the loss of and/or damage to intellectual property through security breaches, including internal and external cyber-security threats. Cyber-security attacks by hackers, criminal groups or nation-state organizations are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software (malware, ransomware and viruses), phishing and social engineering, cyber extortion, attempts to gain unauthorized access to networks, computer systems and data, malicious or negligent actions of employees (including misuse of information they are entitled to access) and other forms of electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in business systems, an inability to process customer orders and/or lost customer orders, unauthorized access, destruction, loss, alteration, falsification, unavailability or release of material confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. Such cyberattacks could result in violations of data protection laws and regulations, damage to the reputation and credibility of the Company, loss of opportunities to acquire or divest of businesses, and loss of ability to commercialize products developed through research and development efforts and, therefore, could have a negative impact on net operating revenues. We rely on relationships with third parties, including suppliers, distributors, co-packers, contractors, cloud data storage and other information technology service providers and other external business partners, for certain functions or for services in support of our operations. These third-party service providers, and partners, with whom we may share data including without limitation, for data hosting, back-office support, and other functions, are subject to similar risks as we are relating to cyber-security, privacy violations, business interruption, and systems, as well as employee failures. While we have procedures in place for selecting and managing our relationships with third-party service providers and other business partners, we do not have control over their business operations or governance and compliance systems, practices and procedures, which increases our financial, legal, reputational and operational risk. These third parties may experience cyber-security incidents that may involve data we share with them or rely on them to provide to us, and the need to coordinate with such third-parties, including with respect to timely notification and access to personnel and information concerning an incident, may complicate our efforts to resolve any issues that arise. We believe that we have adopted appropriate measures including but not limited to ongoing cyber-security risk assessments and business continuity measures to mitigate potential risks to our technology and our operations from these information technology-related disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to operational interruption, damage to our brand image and private data exposure. We could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a cyber-security attack or to repair or replace networks and information systems. Moreover, if our data management systems do not effectively collect, store, process and report relevant data for the operation of our business (whether due to network or equipment malfunction or constraints, software deficiencies, cyber-security attack and/or human error), our ability to effectively plan, forecast and execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations will be impaired, perhaps materially. Any such impairment could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the timeliness with which we report our internal and external operating results. While we have purchased cyber-security insurance, there are no assurances that the coverage would be adequate in relation to any incurred losses. Moreover, as cyber-security attacks and increase in frequency and magnitude, we may be unable to obtain cyber-security insurance in amounts and on terms we view as appropriate for our operations. If we fail to comply with data privacy and personal data protection laws, we could be subject to adverse publicity, government enforcement actions and/or private litigation, which may negatively impact our business and operating results. We receive, process, transmit and store information relating to certain identified or identifiable individuals (“personal data”), including current and former employees, in the ordinary course of business. As a result, we are subject to various U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations relating to personal data. These laws are subject to change, and new personal data legislation may be enacted in other jurisdictions at any time. In the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) became effective in May 2018 for all member states. The GDPR includes operational requirements for companies receiving or processing personal data of residents of the European Union different from those that were previously in place and also includes significant penalties for noncompliance. Additionally, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”), which was enacted in June 2018 and came into effect on January 1, 2020, provides a new private right of action and statutory damages for certain data breaches and imposes operational requirements on companies that process 12 personal data of California residents, including making new disclosures to consumers, employees and B2B contacts about data collection, processing and sharing practices and allowing consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties. Other states have, or may, adopt similar such requirements and regulations. Changes introduced by the GDPR and the CCPA, as well as other changes to existing personal data protection laws and the introduction of such laws in other jurisdictions, and changes to regulation, industry standards and contractual obligations, subject the Company to, among other things, additional costs and expenses and may require costly changes to our business practices and security systems, policies, procedures and practices. The interpretation and application of these laws and regulations are often uncertain and evolving; as a result, there can be no assurance that our data protection measures will be deemed adequate by a regulator or court. There can be no assurances that our security controls over personal data, training of personnel on data privacy and data security, vendor management processes, and the policies, procedures and practices we implement will prevent the improper processing or breaches of personal data. Data breaches or improper processing, or breaches of personal data in violation of the GDPR, the CCPA and/or of other personal data protection or privacy laws and regulations, could harm our reputation, cause loss of consumer confidence, subject us to government enforcement actions (including fines), and mandatory corrective action, or result in private litigation against us, which may result in potential loss of revenue, increased costs, liability for monetary damages or fines and/or criminal prosecution, thereby negatively impacting our business and operating results. If we fail to manage future growth effectively, our business could be materially adversely affected. We have experienced rapid growth and anticipate such growth may continue. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we grew from 225 to 378 employees, and expect to continue expanding our hiring and marketing efforts with no assurance that our business or revenue will continue to grow. This growth may place significant demands on management and our operational infrastructure. As we continue to grow, we must manage such growth effectively by successfully integrating, developing and motivating a large number of new employees, while maintaining the beneficial aspects of our company culture. If we do not manage the growth of our business and operations effectively, the quality of our products and efficiency of our operations could suffer and we may not be able to execute on our business plan, which could harm our brand, results of operations and overall business. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that we will achieve our planned growth, or even if we are able to grow as planned, that we will continue to sustain such growth or performance. We may incur material losses as a result of product recall and product liability . We may be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury, illness or death. We also may be required to recall some of our products if they become contaminated or are damaged or mislabeled. A significant product liability judgment against us, or a widespread product recall, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The amount of the insurance we carry is limited, and that insurance is subject to certain exclusions and may or may not be adequate. We rely on our management team and other key personnel. We depend on the skills, experience, relationships, and continued services of key personnel, including our experienced management team. In addition, our ability to achieve our operating goals also depends on our ability to recruit, train, and retain qualified individuals. We compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel, and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract and retain additional talented personnel. Any such loss or failure could adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results. In particular, our continued success will depend in part, on our ability to retain the talents and dedication of key employees. Our business may be adversely affected, and our management team may be distracted as a result of new COVID-19 variants. Furthermore, we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any of our key employees who leave or be able to offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms, all of which could adversely affect our procurement and distribution processes, sales and marketing activities, financial processes & condition and results of operations. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) has not passed on the efficacy of our products or the accuracy of any claim we make related to our products. Although seven independent clinical studies have been conducted relating to the calorie-burning and related effects of our products, the results of these studies have not been submitted to or reviewed by the FDA. Further, the FDA has not passed on the efficacy of any of our products nor has it reviewed or passed on any claims we make related to our products, including the claim that our products aid consumers in burning calories or enhancing their metabolism. The Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) regulates advertising and may review the truthfulness of and substantiation for any claim we make related to our products. Our advertising activities are subject to regulation by the FTC under the Federal Trade Commission Act. In recent years, the FTC and state attorneys general have initiated numerous investigations of dietary and nutritional supplement companies and products. Any actions or investigations initiated against the Company by governmental authorities or private litigants could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The shifting regulatory environment through the various jurisdictions in which are products are sold necessitates building and maintaining robust systems to achieve and maintain compliance in multiple jurisdictions and increases the possibility that we may violate one or more of the legal requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any applicable laws or regulations, we may be subject to, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, injunctions, or product withdrawals, recalls or seizures, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, our financial condition and results of operations. 13 Risk Factors Relating to Our Industry We are subject to significant competition in the functional energy drink and supplement industries. The functional energy drink and supplement industries are highly competitive. The principal areas of competition are pricing, packaging, distribution channel penetration, development of new products and flavors and marketing campaigns. Our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of manufacturers, most of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution resources and name recognition than we do. Important factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include the taste and flavor of our products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective development of new, unique cutting-edge products, attractive and different packaging, branded product advertising and pricing. Our products compete with all liquid refreshments and with products of much larger and substantially better financed competitors, including the products of numerous nationally and internationally known producers, such as The Coca Cola Company, Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, Nestlé, Waters North America, Inc., Hansen Natural Corp., Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Monster Energy and Red Bull. We also compete with companies that are smaller or primarily local in operation. Our products also compete with private label brands such as those carried by supermarket chains, convenience store chains, drug store chains, mass merchants and club warehouses. New competitors continue to emerge, some of which target specific markets of ours as well as the health and wellness space. This may require additional marketing expenditures on our part to remain competitive. The rapid growth in sales through e-commerce retailers, e-commerce websites, mobile commerce applications and subscription services, may result in a shift away from physical retail operations to digital channels and a reduction in impulse purchases. Further, the ability of consumers to compare prices on a real-time basis using digital technology puts additional pressure on us to maintain competitive prices. Sales in gas chains may also be affected by improvements in fuel efficiency and increased consumer preferences for electric or alternative fuel-powered vehicles, which may result in fewer trips by consumers to gas stations and a corresponding reduction in purchases by consumers in convenience gas retailers. We have been growing our e-commerce sales by using Amazon and leveraging our retail partners e-commerce platforms, rather than building our own internal platform. However, if we are unable to successfully adapt to the rapidly changing retail landscape, our share of sales, volume growth and overall financial results could be negatively affected. Due to competition in the functional energy drink and supplement industries, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter difficulties in maintaining our current revenues, market share or position in the functional energy drink and supplement industries. If our revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Our inability to innovate successfully and to provide new cutting-edge products could adversely affect our business and financial results. Our ability to compete in the highly competitive functional energy drink and supplement industries and to achieve our business growth objectives depends, in part, on our ability to develop new flavors, products and packaging. The success of our innovation, in turn, depends on our ability to identify consumer trends and cater to consumer preferences. If we are not successful in our innovation activities, our business, financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected. Changes in consumer product and shopping preferences may reduce demand for some of our products. The functional energy drink and supplement categories are subject to changing consumer preferences and shifts in consumer preferences may adversely affect us. There is increasing awareness of and concern for health, wellness and nutrition considerations, including concerns regarding caloric intake associated with sugar-sweetened drinks and the perceived undesirability of artificial ingredients. Our products do not contain the artificial preservatives often found in many energy drinks and sodas. CELSIUS ® has no aspartame or high fructose corn syrup and is very low in sodium. The main CELSIUS ® line of products are sweetened with sucralose, a sugar-derived sweetener that is found in Splenda ® , which makes our liquid supplements low-calorie. However, consumer preferences may shift away from the trend towards healthier options that we have observed, and as such, there can be no assurance that our current products and product lines will maintain their current levels of demand. There are also changes in demand for different packages, sizes and configurations. This may reduce demand for our functional energy drinks and liquid supplements, which could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our results of operations. Consumers are seeking greater variety in their functional energy drinks and supplements. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative drinks and supplements that appeal to consumers. In order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative supplements and be competitive in the areas of efficacy, taste, quality and price, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. There is no assurance that consumers will continue to purchase our products in the future. Product lifecycles for some functional energy drink and supplement brands, products and/or packages may be limited to a few years before consumers’ preferences change. The functional energy drink and supplements we currently market are in varying stages of their product lifecycles, and there can be no assurance that such products will become or remain profitable for us. We may be unable to achieve volume growth through product and packaging initiatives. We may also be unable to penetrate new markets. Additionally, as shopping patterns are being affected by the digital evolution, with consumers embracing shopping by way of mobile device applications, e-commerce retailers and e-commerce websites or platforms, we may be unable to address or anticipate changes in consumer shopping preferences or engage with our consumers on their preferred platforms. If our revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We derive virtually all of our revenues from functional energy drinks and supplements, and competitive pressure in the functional energy drink and supplement category could adversely affect our business and operating results. Our focus is in the functional energy drink and supplement categories, and our business is vulnerable to adverse changes impacting the fitness supplement category and business, which could adversely impact our business and the trading price of our common stock. Virtually all of our sales are derived from our functional energy drink and supplements, including our CELSIUS ® Originals and Vibe, CELSIUS HEAT, CELSIUS BCCA+ENERGY, CELSIUS ® On-the-Go and CELSIUS ® product lines. Any decrease in the sales of our functional energy drinks and supplements could 14 significantly adversely affect our future revenues and net income. Historically, we have experienced substantial competition from new entrants in the functional energy drink and supplement categories. The increasing number of competitive products and limited amount of shelf space, including in coolers, in retail stores may adversely impact our ability to gain or maintain our share of sales in the marketplace. In addition, certain actions of our competitors, including unsubstantiated and/or misleading claims, false advertising claims and tortious interference in our business, as well as competitors selling misbranded products, could impact our sales. Competitive pressures in the functional energy drink and supplement categories could impact our revenues, cause price erosion and/or lower market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We compete in an industry that is brand-conscious, so brand name recognition and acceptance of our products are critical to our success and significant marketing and advertising could be needed to achieve and sustain brand recognition. Our business is substantially dependent upon awareness and market acceptance of our products and brands by our targeted consumers. Our business depends on acceptance by our independent distributors of our brand as one that has the potential to provide incremental sales growth rather than reduce distributors’ existing beverage sales. The development of brand awareness and market acceptance is likely to require significant marketing and advertising expenditures. There can be no assurance that CELSIUS ® will achieve and maintain satisfactory levels of acceptance by independent distributors and retail consumers. Any failure of the CELSIUS ® brand to maintain or increase acceptance or market penetration would likely have a material adverse effect on business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to successfully manage new product launches, our business and financial results could be adversely affected. Due to the highly competitive nature of the global functional energy drink and supplement sectors, we expect and intend to continue to introduce new products and evolve existing products to better match consumer demand. The success of new and evolved products depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development and consumer acceptance. Such endeavors may also involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return on capital, exposure to additional regulations and reliance on the performance of third parties. Our sales are affected by seasonality. As is typical in the ""alternative"" beverage category, our sales are seasonal, albeit with our recent significant growth, we have seen ongoing quarter over quarter growth regardless of the season. Our highest sales volumes generally occur in the second and third quarters, which correspond to the warmer months of the year in our major markets. Consumer demand for our products is also affected by weather conditions. Cool, wet spring or summer weather could result in decreased sales of our products and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Our business is subject to many regulations and noncompliance is costly . The production, marketing and sale of our functional energy drinks and supplements are subject to the rules and regulations of various federal, state and local health agencies. The marketing and sale of our products internationally is similarly subject to compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations in those foreign countries where our products are sold. If a regulatory authority finds that a current or future product or production run is not in compliance with any of these regulations, we may be fined, or production may be stopped, thus adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, any adverse publicity associated with any noncompliance may damage our reputation and our ability to successfully market our products. Furthermore, the rules and regulations are subject to change from time to time and while we closely monitor developments in this area, we have no way of anticipating whether changes in these rules and regulations will impact our business adversely. Additional or revised regulatory requirements, whether labeling, environmental, tax or otherwise, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Product safety and quality concerns, or other negative publicity (whether or not warranted) could damage our brand image and corporate reputation and may cause our business to suffer. Our success depends in large part on our ability to maintain consumer confidence in the safety and quality of all of our products. We have rigorous product safety and quality standards, which we expect our operations as well as our suppliers to meet. However, despite our strong commitment to product safety and quality, we or our suppliers may not always meet these standards, particularly as we expand our product offerings through innovation or acquisitions into product categories that are beyond our traditional range of functional energy drinks and supplements. If we or our suppliers fail to comply with applicable product safety and quality standards, or if our supplement products taken to the market are or become contaminated or adulterated by any means, we may be required to conduct costly product recalls and may become subject to product liability claims and negative publicity, which could cause our business to suffer. Our success also depends on our ability to build and maintain the brand image for our existing products, new products and brand extensions and maintain our corporate reputation. There can be no assurance that our advertising, marketing and promotional programs and our commitment to product safety and quality, human rights and environmental sustainability will have the desired impact on our products’ brand image and on consumer preferences and demand. Claims regarding product safety, quality and/or ingredient content issues, efficacy or lack thereof (real or imagined), our culture and our workforce, our environmental impact and the sustainability of our operations, or allegations of product contamination, even if false or unfounded, could tarnish the image of our brands and may cause consumers to choose other products. Consumer demand for our products could diminish significantly if we, our employees, distributors, suppliers or business partners fail to preserve the quality of our products, act or are perceived to act in an unethical, illegal, discriminatory, unequal or socially irresponsible manner, including with respect to the sourcing, content or sale of our products, service and treatment of our customers, or the use of customer data. Furthermore, our brand image or perceived product quality could be adversely affected by litigation, unfavorable reports in the media (internet or elsewhere), studies in general and regulatory or other governmental inquiries (in each case whether involving our products or those of our competitors) and proposed or new legislation affecting our industry. Negative postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company or any one of our brands, even if inaccurate or malicious, could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the Company. Business incidents, whether isolated or recurring and whether 15 originating from us, our distributors, suppliers or business partners, that erode consumer trust can significantly reduce brand value or potentially trigger boycotts of our products and can have a negative impact on consumer demand for our products as well as our reputation and financial results. The impact of such incidents may be exacerbated if they receive considerable publicity, including rapidly through social or digital media (including for malicious reasons) or result in litigation. In addition, from time to time, there are public policy endeavors that are either directly related to our products and packaging or to our business. These public policy debates can occasionally be the subject of backlash from advocacy groups that have a differing point of view and could result in adverse media and consumer reaction, including product boycotts. Similarly, our sponsorship relationships could subject us to negative publicity as a result of actual or alleged misconduct by individuals or entities associated with organizations we sponsor or support. Likewise, campaigns by activists connecting us, or our supply chain, with human and workplace rights, environmental or animal rights issues could adversely impact our corporate image and reputation. Allegations, even if untrue, that we are not respecting the human rights found in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights; actual or perceived failure by our suppliers or other business partners to comply with applicable labor and workplace rights laws, including child labor laws, or their actual or perceived abuse or misuse of migrant workers; adverse publicity surrounding obesity and health concerns related to our products, our environmental impact and the sustainability of our operations, labor relations, our culture and our workforce or the like could negatively affect our Company’s overall reputation and brand image, which in turn could have a negative impact on our products’ acceptance by consumers. Litigation could expose us to significant liabilities and reduce demand for our products. We have been and are a party, from time to time, to various litigation claims and legal proceedings, including, but not limited to, intellectual property, false advertising, product liability, breach of contract claims and others. Other lawsuits have been filed against us claiming that certain statements made in our advertisements and/or on the labels of our products were false and/or misleading or otherwise not in compliance with food standards under local law. Putative class action lawsuits have also been filed against us, alleging that certain claims in our marketing promotional amount to false advertising. We do not believe any statements made by us in our promotional materials or set forth on our product labels are false or misleading or noncompliant with local law, and we have been defending, and will continue to vigorously defend such lawsuits. At times, even if the Company believes that it is acting in compliance with the law, management may choose to settle claims in order to avoid lengthy trials or disruptions to its business. Any of the foregoing matters or other litigation, the threat thereof, or unfavorable media attention arising from pending or threatened litigation could consume significant financial and managerial resources and result in diminished operational efficiency of the Company, significant monetary awards against us, an injunction barring the sale of any of our products and injury to our reputation. Our failure to successfully defend or settle any litigation or legal proceedings could result in liabilities that, to the extent not covered by our insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenue and profitability, and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline. If we do not maintain an effective internal control environment as well as adequate control procedures over our financial reporting, investor confidence may be adversely affected thereby affecting the value of our stock price. The Company has identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting that, if not remediated, could result in additional material misstatements in its consolidated financial statements. We are required to maintain proper internal control over our financial reporting and adequate controls related to our disclosures. As defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. If we fail to maintain adequate controls, our business, the results of operations, financial condition and/or the value of our stock may be adversely impacted. As described in Part II, Item 9A — Controls and Procedures, management identified material weaknesses in the Company's internal control over financial reporting in 2021 and 2022. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The Company is in the process of remediating the material weaknesses. If the Company’s remediation efforts are insufficient or if additional material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, the Company's consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and it could be required to revise or restate its financial results, which could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, restrict its ability to access the capital markets, require it to expend significant resources to correct the material weakness, subject it to fines, penalties or judgments, harm its reputation or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence. We face investigation from the SEC, the timeline for which and the results of which are currently unknown. On January 8, 2021, we received a letter from the SEC Division of Enforcement seeking the production of documents in connection with a non-public fact-finding inquiry by the SEC to determine whether violations of the federal securities laws have occurred. On August 20, 2021, the SEC issued a subpoena for production of documents in connection with the matter. Neither the January 8, 2021 SEC letter nor the August 20, 2021 subpoena means that the SEC has concluded that the Company or anyone else has violated the federal securities laws. We have cooperated and will continue to cooperate with the SEC staff in its investigation. At this time, however, we cannot predict the length, scope, or results of the investigation or the impact, if any, of the investigation on our results of operations. We may also be subject to further or other examinations, investigations, proceedings and orders by the SEC or other regulators. Any such further or other actions could be expensive and damaging to our business, results of operations and financial condition. Risk Factors Related to Financial Risks 16 Fluctuations in our effective tax rate could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to income and other taxes in both the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. Therefore, we are subject to audits for multiple tax years in various jurisdictions at once. Our 2019 through 2021 U.S. federal income tax returns are subject to examination by the IRS. Our state income tax returns are subject to examination for the 2018 through 2021 tax years. At any given time, events may occur which change our expectation about how any such tax audits will be resolved and thus, there could be significant variability in our quarterly and/or annual tax rates, because these events may change our plans for uncertain tax positions. Changes in U.S. tax laws as a result of any legislation proposed by the new U.S. Presidential Administration or U.S. Congress, which may include efforts to change or repeal the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the federal corporate income tax rate reduction, could adversely affect our provision for income taxes, resulting in an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, changes in the manner in which U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings, including changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. For example, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) has recommended changes to numerous long-standing international tax principles through its base erosion and profit shifting (“BEPS”) project. These changes, to the extent adopted, may increase tax uncertainty, result in higher compliance costs and adversely affect our provision for income taxes, results of operations and/or cash flow. In connection with the OECD’s BEPS project, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in various countries. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in jurisdictions in which we operate, or the adoption of new or reformed tax legislation or regulation, may make resolving tax disputes more difficult and the final resolution of tax audits and any related litigation could differ from our historical provisions and accruals, resulting in an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We may be required in the future to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired. Under United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“U.S. GAAP”), we are required to review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable include, declining or slower than anticipated growth rates for certain of our existing products, a decline in stock price and market capitalization, and slower growth rates in our industry. We may be required in the future to record a significant charge to earnings during the period in which we determine that our intangible assets have been impaired. Any such charge would adversely impact our results of operations. As of December 31, 2022, our goodwill totaled approximately $13.7 million and intangible assets totaled approximately $12.3 million. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our operating results. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, expenses, profits, assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, our reported earnings may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Moreover, any favorable impacts to profit margins or financial results from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are likely to be unsustainable over time. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, aggregate foreign currency transaction (losses) gains, resulted in a loss of $2.5 million, and gains of $0.8 million and $0.6 million, respectively. Potential changes in accounting standards or practices and/or taxation may adversely affect our financial results. We cannot predict the impact that future changes in accounting standards or practices may have on our financial results. New accounting standards could be issued that change the way we record revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. These changes in accounting standards could adversely affect our reported earnings. Increases in direct and indirect income tax rates could affect after-tax income. Equally, increases in indirect taxes (including environmental taxes pertaining to the disposal of beverage containers and/or indirect taxes on beverages generally or energy drinks in particular) could affect our products’ affordability and reduce our sales. If we fail to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting on a consolidated basis, our stock price and investor confidence in the Company could be materially and adversely affected. We are required to maintain both disclosure controls and procedures as well as internal control over financial reporting that are effective for the purposes described in “Part II, Item 9A – Controls and Procedures.” If we fail to maintain such controls and procedures, our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or the value of our stock could be materially harmed. Uncertainty in the financial markets and other adverse changes in general economic or political conditions in any of the major countries in which we do business could adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations. Global economic uncertainties, including highly inflationary economies and foreign currency exchange rates, affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways, making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. There can be no assurance that economic improvements will occur, or that they would be sustainable, or that they would enhance conditions in markets relevant to us. In addition, we cannot predict the duration and severity of disruptions in any of our markets or the impact they may have on our customers or business, as our expansion outside of the United States has increased our exposure to any developments or crises in African, Asian, European and other international markets. Unfavorable economic conditions and financial uncertainties in our major international markets and unstable political conditions, including civil unrest and governmental changes, in certain of our other international markets could undermine global consumer confidence and reduce consumers’ purchasing power, thereby reducing demand for our products. Included in the foregoing are long-term uncertainties surrounding the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union on January 31, 2020 (commonly referred to as “Brexit”) and any 17 resulting increases in tariffs, importation restrictions, out of stocks, volatility in currency exchange rates, including the valuation of the euro and the British pound in particular, changes in the laws and regulations applied in the United Kingdom or impacts on economic and market conditions in the United Kingdom, the European Union and its member states and elsewhere. Volatility of stock price may restrict sale opportunities. Our stock price is affected by a number of factors, including stockholder expectations, financial results, the introduction of new products by us and our competitors, general economic and market conditions such as inflation, estimates and projections by the investment community and public comments by other parties as well as many other factors including litigation, many of which are beyond our control. We do not provide guidance on our future performance, including, but not limited to, our revenues, margins, product mix, operating expenses or net income. We may be unable to achieve analysts’ net revenue and/or earnings forecasts, which are based on their own projected revenues, sales volumes and sales mix of many product types and/or new products, certain of which are more profitable than others, as well as their own estimates of gross margin and operating expenses. There can be no assurance that we will achieve any such projected levels or mix of product sales, revenues, gross margins, operating profits and/or net income. As a result, our stock price is subject to significant volatility, and stockholders may not be able to sell our stock at attractive prices. In addition, periods of volatility in the market price of our stock could result in the initiation of securities class action litigation against us. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, the high of our stock price was $122.24 and the low was $38.31. Our investments are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments. On December 31, 2022, we had $652.9 million in cash and cash equivalents. Certain of these investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. These risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our future results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Risk Factors Related to our Common Stock We cannot guarantee the continued existence of an active established public trading market for our common stock. Our common stock currently is listed for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Trading in stock quoted on the Nasdaq Capital Market may often experience wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance. Market prices for our common stock may also be influenced by a number of other factors, including: Our board of directors has the authority, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with terms that may not be beneficial to common stockholders and with the ability to affect adversely stockholder voting power and perpetuate their control over us. We have outstanding shares of preferred stock with rights and preferences superior to those of our common stock. Our Articles of Incorporation allows our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without any vote or further action by our stockholders. Our board of directors has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock. As a result, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation, the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock and the right to the redemption of the shares, together with a premium, prior to the redemption of our common stock. On August 1, 2022, the Company filed the Series A Certificate with the Secretary of the State of Nevada (the “Series A Certificate”). The Series A Certificate authorizes 1,466,666 shares of Series A Preferred Stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock”), all of which were issued and sold to Pepsi, and are initially convertible at the rate of five shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share, for each share of Series A Preferred Stock. The Series A Preferred Stock ranks, with respect to distribution rights and rights on liquidation, winding-up and dissolution, (i) senior and in priority of payment to the Company’s common stock, (ii) on parity with any class or series of capital stock of the Company expressly designated as ranking on parity with the Series A Preferred Stock, and (iii) junior to any class or series of capital stock of the Company expressly designated as ranking senior to the Series A Preferred Stock. Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company (but excluding any change of control), each holder of Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive an amount per share of Series A Preferred Stock equal to the Liquidation Preference, as defined in the Series A Certificate. Holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to cumulative dividends, which will be payable quarterly in arrears either in cash, in-kind, or a combination thereof. Dividends will accrue on each share of Series A Preferred Stock at the rate of 5.00% per annum, subject to adjustment 18 as set forth in the Series A Certificate. In addition to such quarterly regular dividends, such shares of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to participate in dividends paid to holders of common stock. Our principal stockholders can exert significant influence on the Company’s corporate affairs. Our principal stockholder owns approximately 24% of our issued and outstanding common stock. Accordingly, they will be able to effectively influence the election of directors, as well as all other matters requiring stockholder approval. The interests of our principal stockholders may differ from the interests of other stockholders with respect to the issuance of shares, business transactions with or sales to other companies, selection of other directors and other business decisions. We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future . We have never paid cash dividends on our common stock. We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock at any time in the foreseeable future. The future payment of dividends directly depends upon our future earnings, capital requirements, financial requirements and other factors that our board of directors will consider. Since we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock, return on your investment, if any, will depend solely on an increase, if any, in the market value of our common stock. General Risk Factors We are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act that require us to incur audit fees and legal fees in connection with the preparation of such reports. These additional costs could reduce or eliminate our ability to earn a profit. We are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and as a result, we are now required to file periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) pursuant to the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. In order to comply with these requirements, our independent registered public accounting firm has to review our financial statements on a quarterly basis and audit our financial statements on an annual basis. Moreover, our legal counsel has to review and assist in the preparation of such reports. The costs charged by these professionals for such services cannot be accurately predicted at this time because factors such as the number and type of transactions that we engage in and the complexity of our reports cannot be determined at this time and will have a major effect on the amount of time to be spent by our auditors and attorneys. However, the incurrence of such costs will obviously be an expense to our operations and thus have a negative effect on our ability to meet our overhead requirements and earn a profit. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our common stock, if a market ever develops, could drop significantly. Our periodic filings as required under the Exchange Act may be subject to review and comment by the SEC, which may result in changes to our public disclosure. Our periodic filings with the SEC in compliance with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, may be subject to review and comment by the SEC. Should the SEC conduct such review and comment, we may be required to revise such periodic filings, including but not limited to the financial statements contained therein. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. Not applicable. Item 2. Properties. We do not own any real property. We lease our principal executive offices located at 2424 North Federal Highway, Boca Raton, Florida 33431. Our premises are leased for a monthly cost of $37.6 thousand. These leases have different periods and extend until the end of 2024. We have no warehouses or other facilities in the United States as we store our product at third party contract warehouse facilities. We also have leased office space in Europe which have an aggregate monthly cost of approximately $11.6 thousand. These leases have different periods and extend until August 2023. Item 3. Legal Proceedings. We are occasionally subject to litigation or other legal proceedings relating to our business. Refer to Note 19 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements related to commitments and contingencies, which is incorporated herein by reference. In addition, from time to time, we may become party to litigation or other legal proceedings that we consider to be a part of the ordinary course of our business. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. 19 PART II Item 5. Market Price of and Dividends on the Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. Principal Market Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “ CELH .” As of February 14, 2023, there were 40 holders of record of our common stock and in excess of 5,000 beneficial owners of our common stock. The holders of record do not include stockholders whose shares are held of record by banks, brokers and other financial institutions. Dividends Pepsi On August 1, 2022, the Company issued 1,466,666 shares of the Series A Preferred Stock to Pepsi, which entitles Pepsi to cumulative dividends, which are payable quarterly in arrears either in cash, in-kind, or a combination thereof, at the Company’s election (“Regular Series A Dividends”). Regular Series A Dividends accrue on each share Series A Preferred Stock at the rate of 5.00% per annum, subject to adjustment as set forth in the Series A Certificate. In addition to such quarterly Regular Series A Dividends, shares of Series A also entitle the holder participate in any dividends paid on the Company’s common stock on an as-converted basis. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company declared and paid $11.5 million in Regular Series A Dividends, which amounted to $7.86 per share of Series A Preferred Stock. There were no cumulative undeclared dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock at December 31, 2022. In addition, there were no dividends issued to common stockholders as of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. With the exception of the Regular Series A Dividends paid to Pepsi, we have never paid cash dividends. We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock at any time in the foreseeable future. The future payment of dividends directly depends upon our future earnings, capital requirements, financial requirements and other factors that our board of directors will consider. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities None, except as previously disclosed in filings with the SEC. Performance Graph The following graph shows a five-year comparison of cumulative total returns.* * The graph assumes that $100 was invested on December 31, 2017, including reinvestment of dividends.

Cumulative total returns for the companies included in the peer group have been weighted on the basis of the total market capitalization for each company. Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities None. 20 Item 6. Reserved. 21 Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. You should read the following discussion in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the corresponding notes included elsewhere in this information statement. This Item 7 contains forward-looking statements. The matters discussed in these forward-looking statements are subject to risk, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those made, projected or implied in the forward-looking statements. Please refer to “ Item 1A. Risk Factors ” for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Annual Report on Form 10-K generally discusses 2022 and 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021. A detailed discussion of 2021 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. Executive Summary/Items Affecting Reported Results The COVID-19 pandemic has presented and continues to present a substantial public health and economic challenge around the world and is affecting our communities and business operations, as well as the global economy and financial markets. The human and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the measures taken or that may be taken in the future by governments, businesses (including the Company and our suppliers, distributors, co-packers and other service providers) and the public at large to limit new variants could directly and indirectly impact our business and results of operations. See ""Part I. Item 1A - Risk Factors."" In spite of the global pandemic, we have worked together with our employees, distributors, co-packers and suppliers around the world to deliver another record year in net sales. Pepsi Transaction and Distribution Agreement On August 1, 2022, the Company issued 1,466,666 shares of non-voting Series A Preferred stock to Pepsi. On an as-converted basis the Series A held by Pepsi accounts for approximately 8.5% of the Company’s outstanding Common Stock, both on the date of issuance and as of December 31, 2022. Also, as discussed Note 14, the Purchase Agreement granted Pepsi the right to designate a nominee for election to the Company’s nine-member board of directors, so long as Pepsi meets certain ownership requirements with respect to the Company’s stock. During the year ended December 31, 2022, a Pepsi executive was nominated by Pepsi and elected to the Company’s board of directors. Also, on August 1, 2022, the Company entered into a Distribution Agreement with Pepsi relating to the sale and distribution of certain of the Company’s beverage products in existing channels and distribution methods in the United States, excluding certain existing customer accounts, sales channels, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Under the Distribution Agreement, the Company granted Pepsi the right to sell and distribute its existing beverage products in existing channels and distribution methods and future beverage products that are added from time to time as licensed products under the Distribution Agreement in defined territories. Distribution and Supply Chain In 2022 and 2021, the Company, as well as the international beverage sector, experienced a number of supply chain challenges which adversely impacted our operations in the form of longer transportation lead times as well as increased ingredient and other input costs, including aluminum, shipping and freight, labor, co-packing fees, and secondary packaging materials, which resulted in increased costs of revenues and increased operating costs. The Company has successfully managed through these challenges, none of which, have impacted the Company's ability to expand its footprint across the U.S. Results of Operations Year ended December 31, 2022 compared to year ended December 31, 2021 Revenue For the year ended December 31, 2022, revenue was approximately $653.6 million, an increase of $339.3 million or 108% from $314.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This growth was as a result of an increase in North America in 2022, of $344.4 million or 126% from 2021. Asia revenues (which primarily consist of royalty revenues from our China licensee) for the year ended December 31, 2022 had an increase of $1.1 million when compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. Other international markets had an increase of $0.8 million or 129% for 2022, when compared to 2021. This was offset by a decrease in Europe revenues in 2022, of $7.0 million or 18% from 2021. The total increase in revenue from 2021 to 2022 was largely attributable to increases in sales volume, as opposed to increases in product pricing. The primary factors behind the increase in North America's sales volume were related to continued strong triple-digit growth in traditional distribution channels, combined with an increase in and optimization of our products’ presence in world class retailers. Additionally, the continued expansion of our DSD network and our transition to the Pepsi distribution network in the fourth quarter, resulted in significant growth of our distributor revenues when compared to the prior year period. The following table sets forth the amount of revenues by category and changes therein for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021: 22 Years Ended December 31, Revenue Source 2022 2021 Total revenue $ 653,604 $ 314,272 North America revenue 617,457 273,005 Europe revenue 31,054 38,097 Asia revenue 3,647 2,538 Other revenue 1,446 632 Gross profit For the year ended December 31, 2022, gross profit increased by $142.7 million or 111% to $270.9 million, from $128.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Gross profit margins increased to 41.4% for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 40.8% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in gross profit dollars is related to increases in sales volumes, while the increase in gross profit margins from 2021 to 2022 is mainly related to our ability to leverage the increased volumes associated with our significant growth as well as increased pricing and improved processes and freight lanes, offset in part by increases in raw material costs (including high priced aluminum cans that were significantly depleted throughout 2022). The increase in gross profit dollars, includes $339.3 million related to purchase and volume increases, which was offset in part by increases in costs of $196.6 million. Sales and marketing expenses Sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 were $352.8 million, an increase of $278.0 million or 372% from $74.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. We increased incremental marketing investment activities of $48.4 million from the 2021 period in comparison to 2022. Additionally, employee costs increased by $8.3 million from the 2021 year ago period as we continued to invest in this area in order to have the proper infrastructure to support our growth. Similarly, we experienced increases in other sales expense in the amount of $196.3 million mainly related to termination fees and trade-marketing activities to support our continued expansion of our DSD network. Lastly, storage and distribution as well as broker costs accounted for the remainder of the increase in this area in the amount of $25.0 million when compared to the prior year period, mainly related to the increase in business volume. General and administrative expenses General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 were $75.9 million, an increase of $18.4 million or 32% from $57.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Employee costs for the year ended December 31, 2022 reflect an increase of $5.2 million or 67%, as investments in this area were also required to properly support our higher business volume and commercial and operational areas of the business. Administrative expenses amounted to $37.0 million or an increase of $26.0 million or approximately 237%, when compared to the prior year period. This variance is mainly related to an increase in audit costs, legal expenses, insurance costs and office rent. Depreciation, amortization and impairment had an increase of $3.0 million when compared to the prior year due to investments in operational equipment (e.g., coolers) and the impairment of the Func Food brand name. The increased expenses were offset by a lower stock option expense in 2022, which was $20.7 million, a decrease of $15.8 million from the prior year period. This change in stock option expense was mainly attributable to the revaluation of certain share-based payment awards that were modified during 2021. Management deems it very important to motivate employees by providing them ownership in the business in order to promote over performance which translates into the continued success of our business based on key performance attributes. Other Income/(expense) Total net other income for the year ended December 31, 2022, was $5.1 million which reflects an increase of $5.1 million when compared to net total other income of $31.0 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2021. The variance of $5.1 million is mainly related to interest income related to our money market accounts. Income tax (expense)/benefit An income tax expense of $34.6 million was obtained during the 2022 year, primarily due to the tax impact of the $282.5 million Series A Preferred Stock fair value adjustment which will be expensed over twenty years for book purposes. As this expense is non-deductible for tax purposes, the Company recorded a $72.1 million deferred tax liability in 2022 deferred tax expense. The effective income tax rate for the twelve months ending December 31, 2022 was also impacted by disallowed stock-based compensation expense, state and local income taxes and the release of certain state income tax reserves. An income tax benefit of approximately $8.0 million was obtained during the 2021 year, mainly related to the release of our U.S. valuation allowance and windfall benefits on stock-based compensation awards. Net (loss)/income attributed to common stockholders Net loss attributed to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2022, was $198.8 million or a loss of $2.63 per share based on a weighted average of 75,649 shares outstanding. In comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2021 the Company had net income attributed to common stockholders of $3.9 million with a weighted average of 73,781 shares outstanding and a dilutive weighted average of 77,689 shares outstanding, with a $0.05 per share for each. Liquidity and Capital Resources 23 General As of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, we had unrestricted cash of $614.2 million and $16.3 million, respectively, and working capital of $756.7 million and $169.2 million, respectively. We believe that cash available from operations, including our cash resources, will be sufficient for our working capital needs, including purchase commitments for raw materials and inventory, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, purchases of capital assets, and equipment, for the next twelve (12) months, with respect to our current operating plan. Please refer to ""Risk Factors"" in Part 1, item 1A, for these and other factors that may have a material effect on our operations. Our primary sources of cash included cash from operations, and proceeds from the issuance of Series A convertible preferred shares. These sources of cash are available to fund cash outflows that have both a short and long-term component. Purchases of inventories, increases in accounts receivable and other assets, equipment (including coolers), advances for our distributors, co-packers, payments of accounts payable, and income taxes payable are expected to remain our principal recurring use of cash. In addition to cash flow from operations, our primary sources of working capital have been the proceeds from private placements including a private placement of 1,466,666 shares of Series A Preferred as part of our strategic transaction with Pepsi at a price of $375 per share, completed in August of 2022. Cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $108.2 million in 2022, which compares to $96.6 million net cash used by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021. The $204.8 million increase in cash generation was driven by continued growth in the operations of the Company as well as timing of cash receipts and payments associated with the Pepsi transition. The use of cash in 2021was primarily driven by higher inventory levels in order to properly service the demand for our products and to mitigate inefficiencies of the global supply chain. Cash flows (used in) provided by investing activities Cash flows used in investing activities totaled $5.7 million in 2022, which compares to cash used in investing activities of $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The change in the cash used in investing activities when compared to the 2021 period was primarily due to the investment of approximately $8.3 million mainly pertaining to equipment which was partially offset by note receivable payments from our China licensee of approximately $2.6 million. Cash flows provided by financing activities Cash flows provided by financing activities totaled $534.1 million for 2022, representing a $462.7 million increase from $71.4 million in 2021. The increase of cash provided by financing activities is mainly related to the net proceeds of $542 million from the issuance of Series A convertible preferred shares related to Pepsi, net of issuance costs. Net proceeds were received from a public offering in June 2021 for approximately $67.8 million. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we are required to make judgments and estimates that significantly affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. Our estimates are based on historical experience, current trends and various other assumptions we believe to be relevant under the circumstances. We review the underlying factors used in our estimates regularly, including reviewing the significant accounting policies impacting the estimates, to ensure compliance with U.S. GAAP. However, due to the uncertainty inherent in our estimates, actual results may be materially different. We have identified the accounting estimates below as critical to understanding and evaluating the financial results reported in our consolidated financial statements. For a complete description of our significant accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements, see Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies . Promotional (Billbacks) Allowance The Company’s billbacks are calculated based on various programs with distributors and retail customers, and accruals are established at the time of initial product sale for the Company’s anticipated liabilities. These accruals are based on agreed upon terms as well as the Company’s historical experience with similar programs and require management’s judgment with respect to estimating consumer participation and/or distributor and retail customer performance levels. Differences between such estimated expenses and actual expenses for promotional and other allowance costs have historically been insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. Promotional and other allowances primarily include consideration given to distributors or retail customers, including, but not limited to, the following: (i) discounts granted off list prices to support price promotions to end consumers by retailers; (ii) reimbursements given to distributors for agreed portions of their promotional spend with retailers, including slotting, shelf space allowances, and other fees for both new and existing products; (iii) agreed share of fees given to distributors and/or directly to retailers for advertising, in-store marketing, and promotional activities; (iv) agreed share of slotting, shelf space allowances, and other fees given directly to retailers, club stores and/or wholesalers; (v) incentives given to distributors and/or retailers for achieving or exceeding certain predetermined volumes goals; (vi) discounted products; (vii) contractual fees given to distributors related to sales made by the Company directly to certain customers that fall within the distributors’ sales territories; and (viii) contractual fees given to distributors for items sold below defined pricing targets. The promotional programs are of varying durations, typically ranging from one week to one year based on the 24 agreed-upon terms. The nature of such programs is determined on a per retail customer or distributor basis, and in certain instances, the same program is set for multiple customers or distributors. The billback fees are recorded as a reduction to net sales in the period the underlying sale occurs. Total promotional expenditures included as a reduction to revenue were $158.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, and accrued promotional allowances were $36.0 million as of December 31, 2022. Revenue Recognition The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied. Product sales occur once control or title is transferred based on the commercial terms. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods. Product sales are recorded net of variable consideration, such as provisions for returns, discounts and allowances. Such provisions are calculated using historical averages and adjusted for any expected changes due to current business conditions. Consideration given to customers for cooperative advertising is recognized as a reduction of revenue except to the extent that there is a distinct good or service, in which case the expense is classified as selling or marketing expense. The amount of consideration the Company receives and revenue the Company recognizes varies with changes in customer incentives the Company offers to its customers and their customers. Additionally, for any agreements which are one year or less, the practical expedient under ASC 340-40-25-4 is applied to expense contract acquisition costs when incurred if the amortization period of the contract asset would have otherwise been recognized in one year or less. Sales taxes and other similar taxes are excluded from revenue. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for cash discounts, returns and spoilage based on the Company’s historical experience. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Valuation We evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or when an interim triggering event occurs that would indicate impairment may have taken place. We evaluate our other definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when evidence exists that certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Judgments and assumptions are required in such impairment evaluations. During the third quarter of 2022, we entered into a long term distribution agreement with Pepsi. The addition of the Pepsi distribution network has shifted the Company's focus to the US market and as a consequence it was determined that impairment indicators for the Func Foods brands indefinite intangible asset were present. The Company no longer anticipates focusing on the expansion of Func Food branded products and the Company plans to focus on Celsius branded products. As a result of the strategic shift, which the Company considered a triggering event, the Company quantitatively tested the Func Foods brand name for impairment utilizing the relief from royalty method to determine fair value. As a result of the quantitative assessment, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $2.5 million which is presented within General and Administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income. Our annual impairment evaluation of goodwill involves qualitative aspects, including comparing our single reporting unit's fair value to its respective carrying value. Some of the qualitative aspects evaluated included macro-economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors regarding our raw materials and operations and overall financial performance of our business. We use the income approach to determine the fair value of our definite-lived customer relationships intangible asset. In accordance with FASB ASC 350, intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are measured for impairment at least annually, or when events indicate that an impairment exists. The Company calculates impairment as the excess of the carrying value of its indefinite-lived assets over their estimated fair value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimate of fair value a write-down is recorded. The Company amortizes its trademarks with finite useful lives over their respective useful lives. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill and intangible assets impaired in future periods. Additionally, disruptions to our business such as prolonged recessionary periods or unexpected significant declines in operating results could result in impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets in future periods. Changes in the factors used in our fair value estimates, including the impacts of the cost inflation or other margin erosion, and discount rates used, could have a significant impact on the fair values of the reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. In the normal course of business our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks. The principal market risks (i.e., the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices) to which we are exposed are fluctuations in commodity and other input prices affecting the costs of our raw materials (including, but not limited to increases in the price of aluminum cans, sucralose, caffeine, vitamins, fluctuations in energy and fuel prices). We generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials. We are also subject to market risks with respect to the cost of commodities and other inputs because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. We do not use derivative financial instruments to protect ourselves from fluctuations in interest rates and generally do not hedge against fluctuations in commodity prices. Our net sales to customers outside of the United States were approximately 6% and 13% of consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our growth strategy includes expanding our international business. As a result, we are subject to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. As of December 31, 2022, we had $0.5 million in cash which is not subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. 25 Item 8.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure Not applicable. 26 Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. Disclosure controls and procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms adopted by the SEC, including to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial and accounting officer), or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our President and Chief Executive Officer as well as our Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based on that evaluation, our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report because of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described below. Notwithstanding the conclusion by our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer that our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022 were not effective, and notwithstanding the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below, management believes that the consolidated financial statements and related financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as of the dates presented, and for the periods ended on such dates, in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and financial officers and effected by the Company’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013) (the “COSO Framework”). A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As of December 31, 2022, management has identified the following material weaknesses in internal controls: As a result of the material weaknesses described above, the Company’s management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective. Remediation Plan 27 As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, management is re-assessing the design of controls and modifying processes designed to improve our internal control over financial reporting and remediate the control deficiencies that led to the material weaknesses, including but not limited to (a) improving consistency in change management supported by standard operating procedures to govern the authorization, testing and approval of changes to information technology systems supporting all of the Company’s internal control processes, (b) enhancing design and implementation of our control environment, including the expansion of formal accounting and IT policies and procedures and financial reporting controls, (c) continuing to identify and design and implement effective review and approval controls, and (d) implementing appropriate timely review and oversight responsibilities within the accounting and financial reporting functions. Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting Except for the determination by management of the material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting described above, there have been no other changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2022, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

F- 10 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements F- 11 F- 1 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Celsius Holdings, Inc. Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Celsius Holdings, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weaknesses described below on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, Celsius Holdings, Inc. (the Company) has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weaknesses have been identified and included in management’s assessment. Management has identified material weaknesses relating to: We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2022 consolidated financial statements of the Company. These material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2022 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated March 1, 2023, which expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over F- 2 financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2021. Boca Raton, Florida March 1, 2023 F- 3 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm ﻿ The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Celsius Holdings, Inc. ﻿ Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Celsius Holdings, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income, statement of changes in stockholders’ equity and mezzanine equity, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. ﻿ We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March 1, 2023 expressed an adverse opinion thereon. ﻿ Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. ﻿ We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Accrued Promotional Allowances Description of the Matter As discussed in Notes 2 and 4, the Company’s promotional allowances are calculated based on various programs with its distributors and retail customers, and accruals are established at the time of the initial product sale for the Company’s anticipated liabilities. These accruals are based on agreed-upon terms as well as the Company’s historical experience with similar programs and require management’s judgment with respect to estimating consumer participation and/or distributor and retail customer performance levels. Promotional allowances primarily include consideration given to distributors or retail customers, including, but not limited to, the following: (i) discounts granted off list prices to support price promotions to end consumers by retailers; (ii) reimbursements given to distributors for agreed portions of their promotional spend with retailers, including slotting, shelf space allowances, and other fees for both new and existing products; (iii) agreed share of fees given to distributors and/or directly to retailers for advertising, in-store marketing, and promotional activities; (iv) agreed share of slotting, shelf space allowances, and other fees given directly to retailers, club stores and/or wholesalers; (v) incentives given to distributors and/or retailers for achieving or exceeding certain predetermined volumes; (vi) discounted products; (vii) contractual fees given to distributors related to sales made by the Company directly to certain customers that fall within the distributors’ sales territories; and (viii) contractual fees given to distributors for items sold below defined pricing targets. The promotional programs are of varying durations, typically ranging from one week to one year based on the agreed-upon terms. The promotional expenditures are recorded to the corresponding income statement caption in the period the underlying sale occurs. Total promotional expenditures included as a reduction to revenue were $158.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, and accrued promotional allowances were $36.0 million as of December 31, 2022. F- 4 How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We identified accrued promotional allowances as a critical audit matter because of the extent and subjective nature of management judgment required with respect to estimating consumer participation and/or distributor and retail customer performance levels and future promotional claims. To test the accrued promotional allowances, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating management’s judgment regarding levels of consumer participation and/or distributor and retail customer performance levels and future promotional claims. We selected a sample of accrued promotional allowances recorded for specific distributors and retail customers and sent confirmation requests of the accrual recorded directly to the distributor or retail customer. We compared the confirmation response to the accrued amount recorded by the Company. In instances of nonreplies to our confirmation request from the distributor or retail customer, we compared subsequent settlements to the accrual. If not settled, we developed an independent expectation of the accrual using historical claim and payment data and compared it to the recorded accrued promotional allowance. We tested the promotional expenditure amount recorded as a reduction to net sales and assessed the reasonableness of management’s estimate by developing an expectation of the amount, based on historical promotional expenditure amounts recorded as a percentage of sales, and compared our expectation to the recorded promotional expenditure amount. We performed inquiries of the Company’s sales and marketing personnel to corroborate our understanding of new and existing promotional programs that may alter the relationship between gross billings and promotional allowances, as such programs are considered by management when estimating future promotional claims. We also evaluated management’s ability to estimate promotional allowances by comparing the actual promotional allowances subsequently paid to the original estimates of management. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2021. Boca Raton, Florida March 1, 2023 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Celsius Holdings, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Celsius Holdings, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2020, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. F- 5 Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Collectability of Note Receivable Description of the Matter Effective January 1, 2019, the Company entered into a separate economic agreement for the repayment of its marketing investment in China with Qifeng. Under the repayment agreement, Qifeng agreed to refund the Company over a five-year period. The repayment was formalized via a Note Receivable (“Note”) from Qifeng. The initial outstanding principal under the Note was approximately $12.2 million and was denominated in the Chinese Renminbi (CNY). Installment payments under the Note are due on March 31 each year and the first installment payment on the Note was due March 31, 2020. This payment was delayed and paid in September 2020 due to the COVID 19 pandemic. The next installment payment due March 31, 2021 will be paid via a release of 62,000 shares of Celsius common stock owned by Qifeng. This release will provide sufficient funds to pay the full amount that is due under the second installment payment. Under a separate guarantee agreement the Company will maintain control over 275,079 Celsius common shares which serves as collateral for the payment on the remaining amounts that will become due over the next three-years. We determined based on the fact pattern noted above the long term collectability of the remaining Note balance was as a critical audit matter. The Note is collateralized by the Company’s shares, however we noted that there is volatility relating to the value of the collateral which is based on the share price of the Company’s stock. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following: 1. Obtaining and testing for reasonableness of management’s analysis to support the collectability of the remaining Note balance. 2. Obtained, a confirmation from Qifeng of the remaining balance due under the Note as of December 31, 2020 as well as confirming their intent and ability to pay the next installment keeping them current with the agreement. 3. Reviewed a signed guarantee letter from Qifeng over the Company shares that are being used as collateral associated with the remainder of the Note. 4. Obtained the Qifeng account statement from the Company’s transfer agent verifying the number of shares owned by Qifeng. The value of the collateral shares at December 31, 2020 was in excess of the total note receivable balance as of December 31, 2020. Based on the procedures performed and evidence obtained we concluded that no allowance for collectability was required related to the Note as of December 31, 2020. /s/ Assurance Dimensions We have served as the Company’s auditor from 2017 to 2021 Margate, Florida March 10, 2021 F- 6 Celsius Holdings, Inc.

(the “Company” or “Celsius Holdings”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on April 26, 2005. On January 24, 2007, the Company entered into a merger agreement and plan of reorganization with Elite FX, Inc., a Florida corporation. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Elite FX, Inc. was merged into the Company’s subsidiary, Celsius, Inc. and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company on January 26, 2007. In addition, on March 28, 2007 the Company established Celsius Netshipments, Inc. a Florida corporation as a subsidiary of the Company. On February 7, 2018, the Company established Celsius Asia Holdings Limited, a Hong Kong corporation, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. On February 7, 2018 Celsius China Holdings Limited, a Hong Kong corporation, became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Celsius Asia Holdings Limited and on May 9, 2018, Celsius Asia Holdings Limited established Celsius (Beijing) Beverage Limited, a China corporation, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Celsius Asia Holdings Limited. On October 25, 2019 , the Company acquired 100 % of Func Food Group, Oyj (“Func Food”). The Acquisition was structured as a purchase of all of Func Food’s equity shares and a restructuring of Func Food’s pre-existing debt. Func Food was the Nordic distributor for the Company since 2015. Func Food is a marketer and distributor of nutritional supplements, health food products, and beverages. On August 1, 2022 (“Effective Date”), the Company and PepsiCo Inc. (""Pepsi""), entered into multiple agreements, including a Securities Purchase Agreement (“Purchase Agreement”), Lock-Up Agreements, Registration Rights Agreement, a distribution agreement (“Distribution Agreement”), and a Channel Transition Agreement (""Transition Agreement""). The Securities Purchase Agreement, Lock-Up Agreements and Registration Rights Agreement pertain to the Company’s issuance of 1,466,666 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series A” or “Series A Preferred Stock”) in exchange for cash proceeds of $ 550 million, excluding transaction costs. The Transition Agreement specifies payments to be made by Pepsi to Celsius for transitioning certain existing distribution rights to Pepsi. The Distribution Agreement resulted in Pepsi becoming the Company’s primary distribution supplier for the Company's products in the United States. See Note 13. Related Party Transactions and Note 14. Mezzanine Equity for more information. In connection with the Distribution Agreement and Transition Agreement, the Company terminated agreements with existing suppliers to transition territory rights to Pepsi. The Company recognized total termination expenses of $ 193.8 million , which are presented in Sales and marketing expenses on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive (loss) income for the year ended December 31, 2022. These expenses were recognized by the Company upon delivery of termination notices to the other distributors, in accordance with ASC Topic 420 Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations . The Company is engaged in the development, marketing, sale and distribution of “functional” calorie-burning functional energy drinks and liquid supplements under the Celsius® brand name. Basis of Presentation — The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”) and the rules and regulations of the SEC. Consolidation Policy — The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Celsius Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Significant Estimates — The preparation of consolidated financial statements and accompanying disclosures in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions that the Company may undertake in the future, actual results may differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts, allowance for inventory obsolescence and sales returns, preferred share valuation, the useful lives of property and equipment, impairment of goodwill and intangibles, deferred tax asset valuation allowance, promotional allowance, and valuation of stock-based compensation. Additionally, the business and economic uncertainty resulting from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has made such estimates and assumptions more difficult to calculate. Accordingly, actual results and outcomes could differ from those estimates. Segment Reporting — Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise that engage in business activities, have discrete financial information, and whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker (""CODM"") to make decisions about allocating resources and to assess performance. Even though the Company has operations in several geographies, it operates as a single enterprise. The Company's operations and strategies are centrally designed and executed given that our geographical components are very similar. Our CODM, the CEO, reviews operating results primarily from a consolidated perspective, and makes decisions and allocates resources based on that review. The reason the Company's CODM focuses on consolidated results in making decisions and allocating resources is because of the significant economic interdependencies between the Company's geographical operations and the Company’s U.S. entity. Concentrations of Risk — Substantially all of the Company’s revenue derives from the sale of Celsius ® functional energy drinks and liquid supplements. Pepsi and the Company signed a distribution agreement on August 1, 2022, resulting in Pepsi acting as the Company's preferred distributor performing the direct store delivery for a majority of the Company's U.S. operations. Revenue of our customers accounting for more than 10%, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, are as follows: F- 11 2022 2021 2020 Pepsi 22.2 % — — Costco 16.7 % 12.7 % 2.9 % Amazon 8.8 % 10.1 % 15.1 % All other 52.3 % 77.2 % 82.0 % Total 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Accounts receivable of our customers accounting for more than 10%, for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, are as follows: 2022 2021 Pepsi 47.6 % — Amazon 11.8 % 22.7 % Publix 1.4 % 10.3 % All other 39.2 % 67.0 % Total 100.0 % 100.0 % Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with high-quality financial institutions. At times, balances in the Company’s cash accounts may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had approximately $ 652.4 million and $ 16.0 million , respectively, including $ 38.8 million in restricted cash for 2022 , in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit. Cash and Cash Equivalents — The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Restricted Cash — As disclosed in Note 4. Revenues , the Company received upfront payments from Pepsi during 2022, which are contractually restricted and can only be used to satisfy termination payments due to former distributors or have to be repaid to Pepsi. These upfront payments received from Pepsi cannot be used for general operating activities of the Company and have been classified as restricted cash based on the terms of the Transition Agreement. Accounts Receivable — Accounts receivable are reported at net realizable value. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors pertaining to the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends, and other information. Delinquent accounts are written-off when it is determined that the amounts are uncollectible. Accounts receivable are presented net of billbacks, for customers that are allowed the right to net settle. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, there was an allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately $ 2.1 million and $ 0.8 million , respectively. Inventories — Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company recorded an allowance of approximately $ 8.4 million and $ 2.6 million respectively. The changes in the allowance are included in cost of revenue. Property and Equipment — Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation of property and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset generally ranging from three to seven years . Impairment of Long-Lived Assets — In accordance with ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment the Company reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is determined regarding a long-lived asset if its carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The carrying amount is not recoverable when it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from use of the asset over its remaining useful life and final disposition. The Company did not record any impairments related to long lived assets during the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Long-lived Asset Geographic Data The following table contains long-lived asset information which includes property and equipment and lease right of use assets and excludes goodwill and intangibles, where individual countries represent a material portion of the total: December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 United States $ 9,750 $ 3,043 Sweden 1,251 1,050 Finland 363 301 Other 1 — Long-lived assets related to foreign operations 1,615 1,351 Total long-lived assets-net $ 11,365 $ 4,394 Goodwill — The Company records goodwill when the consideration paid for the acquisition of a business exceeds the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, including related tax effects. Goodwill is not amortized; instead, goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of October 1 st , or more frequently if the Company believes indicators of impairment exist. The Company first assesses qualitative factors such as macro-economic conditions, F- 12 industry and market conditions, and cost factors as well as other relevant events, to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then the Company will calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. If the Company determines that the fair value is less than the carrying value, the Company will recognize an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying value over its fair value. At December 31, 2022 , there were no indicators of impairment. Intangible assets – Intangible assets are comprised of customer relationships and brands acquired in a business combination. The Company amortizes intangible assets with a definitive life over their respective useful lives. The addition of the Pepsi distribution network has shifted the Company's focus to the US market and as a consequence it was determined that impairment indicators for the Func Foods brands indefinite intangible asset were present. The Company no longer anticipates focusing on the expansion of Func Food branded products and the Company plans to focus on Celsius branded products. As a result of the strategic shift, which the Company considered a triggering event, the Company quantitatively tested the Func Foods brand name for impairment utilizing the relief from royalty method to determine fair value as of September 30, 2022. As a result of the quantitative assessment, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $ 2.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 which is presented within General and Administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Revenue Recognition — The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied. Product sales occur once control or title is transferred based on the commercial terms. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods. Product sales are recorded net of variable consideration, such as provisions for returns, discounts and promotional allowances. Such provisions are calculated using historical averages and adjusted for any expected changes due to current business conditions. Consideration given to customers for cooperative advertising is recognized as a reduction of revenue except to the extent that there is a distinct good or service, in which case the expense is classified as selling or marketing expense. The amount of consideration the Company receives and revenue the Company recognizes varies with changes in customer incentives the Company offers to its customers and their customers. Additionally, for any agreements which are one year or less, the practical expedient under ASC 340-40-25-4 is applied to expense contract acquisition costs when incurred if the amortization period of the contract asset would have otherwise been recognized in one year or less. Sales taxes and other similar taxes are excluded from revenue. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for cash discounts, returns, spoilage and promotional allowances based on the Company’s historical experience. Deferred Revenue — The Company receives payments from certain distributors in new territories as reimbursement for contract termination costs paid to the prior distributors in those territories. Amounts received pursuant to these new and/or amended distribution agreements entered into with certain distributors relating to the costs associated with terminating the Company’s prior distributors, are accounted for as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the anticipated life of the respective new distribution agreements. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately $ 189.5 million in deferred revenue, of which $ 179.8 million is classified as deferred revenue-non-current and $ 9.7 million is classified as deferred revenue-current which are presented within the consolidated balance sheets and are contract liabilities related to termination payments received from Pepsi. Refer to Note 13, Related Party Transactions for more information. The deferred revenues will be recognized by the Company, ratably over the twenty-year agreement term. As of December 31, 2021, the Company did not have any deferred revenue related to contract liabilities. Accrued Distributor Termination Fees — Termination charges related to certain of the Company’s prior distributors are included in selling and marketing expenses upon termination. The Company recognized distributor termination expenses of approximately $ 193.8 million , $ 0.6 million , and $ 0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The Company also has a balance of $ 4.0 million in accrued distributor termination fees related to distributors terminated as a result of the Pepsi agreement as well as payment due back to Pepsi in the amount of $ 34.8 million as the projected payments to the prior distributors was less than the payment received from Pepsi, which are located within accounts payable and accrued expenses, on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. Customer Advances — From time to time the Company requires deposits in advance of delivery of products and/or production runs. Such amounts are initially recorded as customer advances liability within other current liabilities. The Company recognizes such revenue as it is earned in accordance with revenue recognition policies. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021 , the Company did no t have any customer advances. Advertising Costs — Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. The Company uses mainly radio, local sampling events, sponsorships, endorsements, and digital advertising. The Company incurred advertising expenses of approximately $ 85.1 million , $ 36.7 million and $ 14.2 million , during years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 , respectively. Research and Development — Research and development costs are charged to general and administrative expenses as incurred and consist primarily of consulting fees, raw material usage and test productions of beverages. The Company incurred expenses of approximately $ 0.4 million , $ 1.0 million and $ 0.5 million during years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 , respectively. Foreign Currency Gain/Losses — Foreign subsidiaries’ functional currency is the local currency of operations and the net assets of foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates. The foreign subsidiaries perform re-measurements of their assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies on a periodic basis and the gain or losses from these adjustments are included in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive (loss) income as foreign exchange gains or losses. For the year ended December 31, 2022 exchange losses have amounted to approximately $ 0.4 million while during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized a foreign currency loss and gain of approximately $ 0.3 million and $ 1.4 million , respectively, mainly related to fluctuations in exchange rates. Translation gains and losses that arise from the translation of net assets from functional currency to the reporting currency, as well as exchange gains and losses on intercompany balances of long-term investment nature, are included in Other Comprehensive Income. The Company incurred foreign currency translation net loss during the year ended December 31, 2022 of approximately $ 2.5 million and a net gain of approximately $ 0.8 million and $ 0.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The Company's operations in different countries required that it transacts in the following currencies: Chinese-Yuan F- 13 Norwegian-Krone Swedish-Krona Finland-Euro Fair Value of Financial Instruments — The carrying value of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate fair value due to their relative short-term maturity and market interest rates. Income Taxes — The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the provisions of ASC Topic 740 Accounting for Income Taxes , which requires, among other things, an asset and liability approach to calculating deferred income taxes. The asset and liability approach require the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets for which management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred asset will not be realized. The Company follows the provisions of the ASC 740-10 related to Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Positions. When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10, the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. The Company has adopted ASC 740-10-25 Definition of Settlement, which provides guidance on how an entity should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits and provides that a tax position can be effectively settled upon the completion of an examination by a taxing authority without being legally extinguished. For tax positions considered effectively settled, an entity would recognize the full amount of tax benefit, even if the tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained based solely on the basis of its technical merits and the statute of limitations remains open. The Company’s tax returns for tax years in 2019 through 2021 remain subject to potential examination by the taxing authorities. Earnings per Share — The Company computes earnings per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260 Earnings per Share (“ASC 260”), which requires earnings per share (""EPS"") for each class of stock (common stock and participating preferred stock) to be calculated using the two-class method. The two-class method is an allocation of earnings (distributed and undistributed) between the holders of common stock and a company’s participating security holders. Under the two-class method, earnings for the reporting period are allocated between common stockholders and other security holders based on their respective participation rights in undistributed earnings. Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income or loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of basic common stock outstanding. The Company’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is classified as a participating security in accordance with ASC 260. Net income allocated to the holders of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock will be calculated based on the stockholders’ proportionate share of weighted average shares of common stock outstanding on an if-converted basis. See Note 3. Earnings Per Share for more information. Share-Based Payments — The Company follows the provisions of ASC Topic 718 Compensation — Stock Compensation and related interpretations. As such, compensation cost is measured on the date of grant at the fair value of the share-based payments. Such compensation amounts, if any, are amortized over the respective vesting periods of the grants. On April 30, 2015, the Company adopted the 2015 Stock Incentive Plan (the ""2015 Plan""). This 2015 Plan is intended to provide incentives which will attract and retain highly competent persons at all levels as employees of the Company, as well as independent contractors providing consulting or advisory services to the Company, by providing them opportunities to acquire the Company’s common stock. The 2015 Plan permits the grant of options and other share-based awards for up to 5.0 million shares. Provisions have been made to permit the grant of options and other share-based awards for up to 5.0 million shares. Cost of Revenue — Cost of Revenue consists of the cost of concentrates and or liquid bases, the costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of products, co-packing fees, repacking fees, in-bound & out-bound freight charges, as well as certain internal transfer costs, warehouse expenses incurred prior to the manufacture of the Company’s finished products, inventory allowance for excess and obsolete products, and certain quality control costs. Raw materials account for the largest portion of the cost of sales. Raw materials include cans, other containers, flavors, ingredients and packaging materials. Operating Expenses — Operating expenses include selling expenses such as warehousing expenses after manufacture, as well as expenses for advertising, samplings and in-store demonstrations costs, costs for merchandise displays, point-of-sale materials and premium items, sponsorship expenses, other marketing expenses and design expenses. Operating expenses also include such costs as payroll costs, travel costs, professional service fees (including legal fees), depreciation and other general and administrative costs. Shipping and Handling Costs — Shipping and handling costs for freight expense on goods shipped are included in cost of sales. Freight expense on goods shipped for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was approximately $ 26.8 million , $ 26.9 million and $ 9.5 million , respectively. Certain reclassification of prior period balances have been made to conform to current presentation. Please refer to consolidated balance sheets, Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and Note 11. Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses Recent Accounting Pronouncements F- 14 The Company adopts all applicable, new accounting pronouncements as of the specified effective dates. In September 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326) (“ASU 2016-13”), which requires the immediate recognition of management’s estimates of current and expected credit losses. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10, which delays the effective date of Topic 326 for Smaller Reporting Companies to interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. The Company has elected the relief provided. Topic 326 is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2023. Adoption of the new standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures. Liquidity — These financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will be able to continue as a going concern. At December 31, 2022, the Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately $ 238.8 million which includes a net loss available to common stockholders of approximately $ 198.8 million for year ended December 31, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2022 the Company’s net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately $ 108.2 million . As of December 31, 2021, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $ 51.5 million which includes a net income available to common stockholders of $ 3.9 million for year ended December 31, 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2021 the Company’s net cash used by operating activities totaled approximately $ 96.6 million . If our sales volumes do not meet our projections, expenses exceed our expectations, or our plans change, we may be unable to generate enough cash flow from operations to cover our working capital requirements. In such case, we may be required to adjust our business plan, by reducing marketing, lower our working capital requirements and reduce other expenses or seek additional financing. Furthermore, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in the global macro-economic environment related to the pandemic and public health crises related to the COVID-19 outbreak. The Company computes earnings per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260 Earnings per Share (“ASC 260”), which requires earnings per share for each class of stock (common stock and participating preferred stock) to be calculated using the two-class method. The two-class method is an allocation of earnings (distributed and undistributed) between the holders of common stock and a company’s participating security holders. Under the two-class method, earnings for the reporting period are allocated between common stockholders and other security holders based on their respective participation rights in undistributed earnings. Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing income or loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of basic common stock outstanding. The Company’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is classified as a participating security in accordance with ASC 260. Net income allocated to the holders of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock consistent of preferred dividends declared and paid during 2022. The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock do not participate in losses, thus no such losses have been allocated to the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock in the periods presented below. For purposes of determining diluted earnings per common share, basic earnings per common share was further adjusted to include the effect of potential dilutive common shares outstanding, including unvested restricted stock and performance-based stock units, using the more dilutive of either the two-class method or the treasury stock method, and Series A Convertible Preferred Stock using the if-converted method. Stock options and warrants that were out-of-the-money were not included in the denominator for the calculation of diluted EPS. Under the two-class method of calculating diluted earnings per share, net income is reallocated to common stock, the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, and all dilutive securities based on the contractual participating rights of the security to share in the current earnings as if all of the earnings for the period had been distributed. For the years ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Net (loss) income attributed to common stockholders Net (loss) income $ ( 187,282 ) $ 3,937 $ 8,524 Less: dividends paid to Series A convertible preferred stockholders ( 11,526 ) — — Net (loss) income attributed to common stockholders $ ( 198,808 ) $ 3,937 $ 8,524 Net (loss) income per common share: Basic $ ( 2.63 ) $ 0.05 $ 0.12 Dilutive $ ( 2.63 ) $ 0.05 $ 0.11 Weighted average common stock outstanding: Basic 75,649 73,781 70,195 Dilutive 75,649 77,689 74,444 For the year ended December 31, 2022, 10.2 million of potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share related to common stockholders as their effect was antidilutive. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers . The Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied. Product sales occur once control is transferred, based on the commercial terms. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods. Product sales are recorded net of variable consideration, such as provisions for returns, discounts and allowances. Such provisions are calculated using historical averages and adjusted for any expected changes due to current business conditions. Consideration given to customers for cooperative advertising is recognized as a reduction of revenue except to the extent that there is a distinct good or service, in which case the expense is classified as selling or marketing expense. The amount of F- 15 consideration the Company receives and revenue the Company recognizes varies with changes in customer incentives the Company offers to its customers and their customers. Additionally, for any agreements which are one year or less, the practical expedient under ASC 340-40-25-4 is applied to expense contract acquisition costs when incurred if the amortization period of the contract asset would have otherwise been recognized in one year or less. Promotional (Billback) Allowance The Company’s billback allowance programs with its distributors and/or retailers are executed through separate agreements in the ordinary course of business. These agreements generally provide for one or more of the arrangements described above and are of varying durations, typically ranging from one week to one year. The Company’s billbacks are calculated based on various programs with distributors and retail customers, and accruals are established for the Company’s anticipated liabilities. These accruals are based on agreed upon terms as well as the Company’s historical experience with similar programs and require management’s judgment with respect to estimating consumer participation and/or distributor and retail customer performance levels. Differences between such estimated expenses and actual expenses for promotional and other allowance costs have historically been insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. Billbacks (variable consideration) recorded as a reduction to net sales, primarily include consideration given to the Company’s distributors or retail customers including, but not limited to the following: For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, promotional allowance included as a reduction of revenue were $ 158.5 million , $ 64.2 million , and $ 28.7 million , respectively. Information about the Company’s net sales by geographical location for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 is as follows: For the years ended December 31, December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 2020 North America $ 617,457 $ 273,005 $ 95,480 Europe 31,054 38,097 33,727 Asia 3,647 2,538 1,093 Other 1,446 632 426 Net sales $ 653,604 $ 314,272 $ 130,726 All of the Company’s North America revenue is derived from the United States, which is the Company’s country of domicile. Of the Company’s total foreign revenues of approximately $ 36.1 million , $ 41.3 million and $ 35.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, Sweden represented the largest foreign portion of total consolidated revenue of approximately $ 21.7 million , $ 26.9 million , and $ 23.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Agreements with PepsiCo, Inc. The Company executed multiple agreements with Pepsi on August 1, 2022, including a Distribution Agreement relating to the sale and distribution of certain of the Company’s beverage products in existing channels and distribution methods in the United States, excluding certain existing customer accounts, sales channels, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands (the “Territory”). Under the Distribution Agreement, the Company has granted Pepsi the right to sell and distribute its existing beverage products in existing channels and distribution methods and future beverage products that are added from time to time as licensed products under the Distribution Agreement in defined territories. The Distribution Agreement represents a master service agreement and can be cancelled by either party without cause in the nineteenth year of the term (i.e., 2041), the twenty-ninth year of the term (i.e., 2051) and each ten (10) year period thereafter (i.e., 2061, 2071, etc.) by providing twelve (12) months’ written notice on August 1st of each such year to the other party. Except for a termination by the Company “with cause” or a termination by Pepsi “without cause”, the Company is required to pay the Purchaser certain compensation upon a termination as specified in the Distribution Agreement. F- 16 The Company agreed to provide Pepsi a right of first offer in the event the Company intends to (i) manufacture, distribute or sell products in certain additional countries as specified in the Distribution Agreement or (ii) distribute or sell products in any future channels and distribution methods during the term of the Agreement. Additionally, pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, the Company and Pepsi agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate and execute with Pepsi a distribution agreement reasonably consistent with the Distribution Agreement for the sale and distribution of the products covered by the Distribution Agreement in Canada, and Pepsi agreed to meet and confer in good faith with the Company regarding the terms and conditions upon which Pepsi may be willing to sell or distribute such products, either directly or through local sub-distributors in certain other additional countries. The Distribution Agreement includes other customary provisions, including non-competition covenants in favor of the Company, representations and warranties, indemnification provisions, insurance provisions and confidentiality provisions. On August 1, 2022, the Company and Pepsi also executed the Transition Agreement, providing for the Company’s transition of certain existing distribution rights in the Territory to Pepsi. Under the terms of the Transition Agreement, Pepsi would pay the Company up to $ 250 million in multiple tranches to facilitate the Company’s transition of certain distribution rights to Pepsi. Amounts received from Pepsi were contractually restricted to only be used to pay termination fees due to other distributors; any excess cash received over amounts due to other distributors is to be refunded back to Pepsi. During 2022, the Company received $ 227.8 million in payments from Pepsi. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had recorded $ 193.8 million in total termination expenses in Selling and marketing expenses, of which $ 193.0 million in termination expenses are related to the Pepsi transition. Accounting for the agreements executed with PepsiCo, Inc. The Company evaluated the Security Purchase Agreement, Transition Agreement, Distribution Agreement, and other agreements executed with Pepsi on August 1, 2022, as one combined contract since the agreements were executed on the same day, with the same counterparty, in contemplation of one another and contractual terms are defined and referenced across the agreements. These agreements will be referred to as the “Pepsi Arrangement” herein. Management concluded the Pepsi Arrangement was partially in the scope of ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”) and partially in the scopes of ASC 505, Equity (“ASC 505"") and ASC 480, Distinguishing liabilities from equity (""ASC 480""). The Company first applied the measurement and classification criteria in ASC 505 and ASC 480 with respect to the Company’s issuance of 1,446,666 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, as the substance of the issuance of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock was determined to be a financing transaction. See Note 14. Mezzanine Equity for the Company’s accounting conclusions with respect to the issuance of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. After application of the measurement and classification principles in ASC 505, and ASC 480, the Company accounted for the residual revenue elements of the Pepsi Arrangement under ASC 606. The revenue elements of the Pepsi Arrangement consisted of (i) $ 227.8 million in payments received from Pepsi under the Transition Agreement and (ii) a $ 282.5 million implicit payment made to Pepsi by Celsius, representing the excess fair value over issuance proceeds received for the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. The $ 227.8 million upfront payment received from Pepsi was only to be used by Celsius to transition territory rights from terminated distributors to Pepsi; any excess cash received from Pepsi over transition payments made by Celsius to the Company’s terminated distributors was contractually restricted and due back to Pepsi. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has recorded a refund liability of $ 34.8 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses representing cash refunds due back to Pepsi and recognized the difference of $ 193.0 million as part of deferred revenues. The deferred revenues will be recognized by Celsius ratably over the twenty-year agreement term. The Company recognized $ 4.2 million of total deferred revenues in the consolidated statement of separations in the year ended December 31, 2022. The $ 282.5 million excess fair value over issuance proceeds of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock represents an implicit payment made to a customer. The Company concluded that this implicit payment meets the definition of an asset, and has been recorded as a Deferred Other Cost current and non-current, in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The Company will amortize the asset balance as contra-revenues ratably over a twenty-year period consistent with the term of the Distribution Agreement. The Company recognized contra-revenues of $ 5.9 million in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive (loss) income in the year ended December 31, 2022 related to the upfront payment included in Deferred Other Cost current and non-current. The Company will assess the Deferred Other Cost asset for impairment at each reporting period. For product sales under the Distribution Agreement, the Company will recognize revenues when control of the underlying goods are transferred to Pepsi based on the contractual terms of noncancellable purchase orders issued by Pepsi. License Agreement In January 2019, the Company entered into a license and repayment of investment agreement with Qifeng Food Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd (“Qifeng”). Under the agreement, Qifeng was granted the exclusive license rights to manufacture, market and commercialize Celsius branded products in China. The term of the agreement is 50 years, with annual royalty fees due from Qifeng after the end of each calendar year. The royalty fees are based on a percentage of Qifeng’s sales of Celsius branded products; however, the fees are fixed for the first five years of the agreement, totaling approximately $ 6.9 million, and then are subject to annual guaranteed minimums over the remaining term of the agreement. Under the agreement, the Company grants Qifeng exclusive license rights and provides ongoing support in product development, brand promotion and technical expertise. The ongoing support is integral to the exclusive license rights and, as such, both of these represent a combined, single performance obligation. The transaction price consists of the guaranteed minimums and the variable royalty fees, all of which are allocated to the single performance obligation. The Company recognizes revenue from the agreement over time because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits from the services. The Company uses the passage of time to measure progress towards satisfying its performance obligation because of its ongoing efforts in providing the exclusive license rights including providing continuous access, updates and support. Total revenue recognized under the agreement was approximately $ 2.0 million , $ 1.6 million , and $ 0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 which is reflected in the revenues from Asia. F- 17 Inventories consist of the following at: December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 Finished goods $ 119,229 $ 123,594 Raw Materials 62,491 70,201 Less: Inventory reserve ( 8,431 ) ( 2,573 ) Inventories $ 173,289 $ 191,222 Prepaid expenses and other current assets total approximately $ 11.3 million and $ 13.6 million , at December 31, 2022 and 2021 , respectively, and consist mainly of prepaid advances to co-packers related to inventory production, advertising, prepaid insurance, prepaid slotting fees, value added tax payments and deposits on purchases. Note receivable consists of the following at: December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 Note Receivable-current $ 2,979 $ 2,588 Note Receivable-non-current 3,574 7,117 Total Note Receivable $ 6,553 $ 9,705 Effective January 1, 2019, the Company restructured its China distribution efforts by entering into two separate economic agreements as it relates to the commercialization of its Celsius products (i.e., the license and repayment of investment agreement with Qifeng, as described above). See Note 4 for information regarding the license agreement with Qifeng. Under a separate economic agreement, Qifeng will repay the marketing investments made by Celsius into the China market through 2018, over the same five-year period as the license agreement. The repayment, which was formalized via a note receivable from Qifeng (the “Note”), will need to be serviced even if the licensing agreement is cancelled or terminated. The Note is denominated in Chinese-Yuan. The Note accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to the weighted average of 5 % of the outstanding principal up to $ 5 million and 2 % of the outstanding principal above $ 5 million. On June 12, 2020, it was agreed to fix the interest rate at 3.21 % which reflected the weighted average interest rate for the 5-year period of the Note. Scheduled principal payments plus accrued interest for the Note are due annually on March 31 of each year starting in 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, interest income for the Note was approximately $ 0.2 million , $ 0.3 million , and $ 0.4 million respectively. The Company assesses the note receivable for impairment at each reporting period, by evaluating whether it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all the contractual principal and interest payments as scheduled in the Note, based on historical experience of Qifeng’s ability to pay, the current economic environment and other factors. If the Note is determined to be impaired, the impairment is measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flows under the Note, discounted at the Note’s effective interest rate. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Note was not deemed to be impaired. As of December 31, 2022, Qifeng is current on all amounts due under the Note and the license agreement. As evidence of solvency for the Note, a stock certificate in Celsius Holding's Inc. which amounts to 30.0 thousand of shares owned by an affiliate under common control of Qifeng is being held at a brokerage account. A letter of guarantee was executed with several restrictions regarding their shares. In particular, it was agreed that the stock would not be sold or transferred without the prior written consent from Celsius. There are other restrictions and agreements, which include that a statement of account will be provided to Celsius on a quarterly basis to confirm and validate the existence of the remaining shares. The shares serve as one component of management's consideration when evaluating impairment indicators. The Company’s leasing activities include an operating lease of its corporate office space from a related party (see Note 13) and other operating and finance leases of vehicles and office space for the Company’s European operations. At the inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. The Company’s assessment is based on: (1) whether the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (2) whether the Company obtains the right to substantially all the economic benefit from the use of the asset throughout the term, and (3) whether the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. The Company allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease and non-lease component based on the component’s relative stand-alone price to determine the lease payments. Lease and non-lease components are accounted for separately. Leases are classified as either finance leases or operating leases based on criteria in ASC Topic 842 Leases . The Company’s operating leases are generally comprised of real estate and vehicles, and the Company’s finance leases are generally comprised of vehicles. F- 18 At lease commencement, the Company records a lease liability equal to the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. A corresponding right-of-use asset (“ROU asset”) is recorded, measured based on the initial measurement of the lease liability. ROU assets also include any lease payments made and exclude lease incentives. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in general and administrative expenses. Included in lease expense are any variable lease payments incurred in the period that were not included in the initial lease liability. Lease expense for finance leases consists of the amortization of the ROU asset on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease term, and interest expense is calculated using the effective interest rate method. The future annual minimum lease payments required under the Company’s leases as of December 31, 2022 are as follows: Operating Finance Future minimum lease payments Leases Leases Total 2023 $ 698 $ 76 $ 774 2024 328 39 367 2025 7 67 74 2026 — 64 64 Total future minimum lease payments 1,033 246 1,279 Less: Amount representing interest ( 46 ) ( 14 ) ( 60 ) Present value of lease liabilities 987 232 1,219 Less: current portion ( 661 ) ( 70 ) ( 731 ) Long-term portion $ 326 $ 162 $ 488 Property and equipment consist of the following at: Estimated Useful Life in Years December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 Merchandising equipment - coolers 5 - 7 $ 9,885 $ 3,052 Office equipment 3 - 7 1,124 891 Vehicles 5 1,257 304 Less: accumulated depreciation ( 2,081 ) ( 1,067 ) Total $ 10,185 $ 3,180 Depreciation expense amounted to approximately $ 1.4 million , $ 0.6 million , and $ 0.1 million during years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 , respectively. At December 31, 2022, goodwill consists of approximately $ 13.7 million resulting from the excess of the consideration paid and the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired from the Func Food acquisition. Intangible assets consist of acquired customer relationships and brands from the Func Food acquisition.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS Transactions with PepsiCo, Inc. As further described in Note 14 Mezzanine Equity , on August 1, 2022, the Company issued 1,466,666 shares of non-voting Series A Convertible Preferred stock (“Series A”) to Pepsi. On an as-converted basis the Series A held by Pepsi accounts for approximately 8.5 % of the Company’s outstanding Common Stock, both on the date of issuance and as of December 31, 2022. Also, as discussed Note 14, the Securities Purchase Agreement entered into on August 1, 2022 (the ""Purchase Agreement”) granted Pepsi the right to designate a nominee for election to the Company’s nine-member board of directors, so long as Pepsi meets certain ownership requirements with respect to the Company’s stock. During the year ended December 31, 2022, a Pepsi executive was nominated by Pepsi and elected to the Company’s board of directors. Based on Pepsi’s contractual representation rights for a seat on the Company’s Board of Directors, the Company has concluded that Pepsi represents a related party to the Company. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, the following transactions were recognized in the Company’s financial statements: F- 20 See Notes 1. Organization and Description of Business, 2. Basis of Presentation Significant Accounting Policies, 11. Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses, and 14. Mezzanine Equity for more information. Related Party Leases The Company’s office is rented from a company affiliated with CD Financial, LLC which is controlled by one of our major stockholders. The lease extends until December 2024 with a monthly rent of $ 37.6 thousand . 14. MEZZANINE EQUITY Series A Convertible Preferred Stock As of December 31, 2022 , Company has designated and authorized 1,466,666 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock with a par value of $ 0.001 per share and a stated value of $ 375 per share. The stated value per share may be increased from time-to-time in the event dividends on the Series A are paid-in-kind (“PIK dividends”) pursuant to the Series A Certification of Designation (the “Series A Certificate”). On August 1, 2022, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company issued 1,466,666 shares of Series A, representing 100 % of the authorized Series A shares, to Pepsi for stated cash consideration aggregating $ 550 million, excluding issuance costs. The Series A was issued concurrently with the execution of Distribution Agreement and the Transition Agreement. The Company determined that the aggregate fair value of the Series A on the issuance date was $ 832.5 million, or approximately $ 568 per share. Accordingly, the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock was recorded at that amount, net of issuance costs of $ 8.0 million, in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and statement of changes in stockholders’ equity and mezzanine equity. Mezzanine Classification The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is redeemable in the event of a change in control as defined in the Series A Certificate. S99-3A(2) of the SEC's Accounting Series Release No. 268 (""ASR 268"") requires preferred securities that are redeemable for cash or other assets to be classified outside of permanent equity if they are redeemable (i) at a fixed or determinable price on a fixed or determinable date, (ii) at the option of the holder, or (iii) upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within the control of the issuer. Preferred securities that are mandatorily redeemable are required to be classified by the issuer as liabilities whereas under ASR 268 guidance an issuer should classify a preferred security whose redemption is contingent on an event not entirely in control of the issuer as mezzanine equity. The Series A is not mandatorily redeemable, however, a change in control is not solely in control of the Company, accordingly, the Company determined that mezzanine treatment is appropriate for the Series A and has presented it as such in our consolidated balance sheets and statement of changes in stockholders’ equity and mezzanine equity, as of and for the year ending December 31, 2022. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Pepsi, together with its affiliates, has certain rights and is also subject to various restrictions with respect to the Company’s outstanding common shares on an as-converted basis through purchases of the Company’s Common Stock in the open market and the accumulation of PIK dividends. Additionally, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Pepsi has the right to designate one nominee for election to Company’s board of directors, for so long as Pepsi (together with its affiliates) beneficially owns at least 3,666,665 shares of the Company’s outstanding Common Stock on an as-converted basis. In August of 2022, the Company expanded the number of seats from eight to nine in connection with the election of a Pepsi representative to the Company’s board of directors. Liquidation Preference The Series A ranks, with respect to distribution rights and rights on liquidation, winding-up and dissolution, (i) senior and in priority of payment to the Company’s Common Stock, (ii) on parity with any class or series of capital stock of the Company expressly designated as ranking on parity with the Series A, and (iii) junior to any class or series of capital stock of the Company expressly designated as ranking senior to the Series A. The aggregate liquidation preference of the Series A is $ 550.0 million on December 31, 2022. Voting The Series A confers no voting rights, except as otherwise required by applicable law, and with respect to matters that adversely change the powers, preferences, privileges, rights or restrictions given to the Series A or provided for its benefit, or would result in securities that would be senior to or pari passu with the Series A. As described above, Pepsi does have a contractual right to representation on the Company’s Board of Directors, subject to certain share holdings thresholds. Dividends The Series A entitles the holder to cumulative dividends, which are payable quarterly in arrears either in cash, in-kind, or a combination thereof, at the Company’s election. Regular Series A Dividends accrue on each share Series A at the rate of 5.00 % per annum, subject to adjustment as set forth in the Series A Certificate. In addition to such quarterly Regular Series A Dividends, shares of Series A also entitle the holder participate in any dividends paid on the Company’s Common Stock on an as-converted basis. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company declared and paid $ 11.5 million in Regular Series A Dividends, which amounted to $ 7.86 per share of Series A. There are no cumulative undeclared dividends on the Series A at December 31, 2022. In addition, there were no dividends issued to common stockholders as of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. F- 21 Redemption Pursuant to certain conditions set forth in the Series A Certificate, Series A may be redeemed at a price per share of Series A equal to the sum of (i) the stated value of such share of Series A as of the applicable Redemption Date, plus (ii) without duplication, all accrued and unpaid dividends previously added to the stated value of such share of Series A, and all accrued and unpaid dividends per share of Series A through such Redemption Date (the “Redemption Price”). Company’s Optional Redemption At any time from and after the earlier of (i) August 1, 2029, if the ten-day volume weighted average price of the Company’s Common Stock ( the “Ten-Day VWAP”) does not exceed the conversion price on the date immediately prior to the date the Company delivers a redemption notice to the holders, and (ii) the cancellation of the Distribution Agreement by the Company, if the Ten-Day VWAP does not exceed the Conversion Price on the date immediately prior to the date the Company delivers a redemption notice to the holders, the Company shall have the right to redeem all (and not less than all) of the then-outstanding shares of Series A, at the Redemption Price. In the event of a Company optional redemption, the Company shall affect such redemption by paying the entire Redemption Price on or before the date that is thirty days after the delivery of the Company’s redemption notice and by redeeming all the shares of Series A on such date. Change in Control Redemption In the event of (i) a sale or transfer, directly or indirectly, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company in any transaction or series of related transactions (other than sales in the ordinary course of business); or (ii) any merger, consolidation or reorganization of the Company with or into any other entity or entities as a result of which the holders of the Company’s outstanding capital stock (on a fully-diluted basis) immediately prior to the merger, consolidation or reorganization no longer represent at least a majority of the voting power of the surviving or resulting Company or other entity; or (iii) any sale or series of sales, directly or indirectly, beneficially or of record, of shares of the Company’s capital stock by the holders thereof which results in any Person or group of Affiliated Persons owning capital stock holding more than 50 % of the voting power of the Company (a “Change in Control”) the Company (or its successor) shall redeem all (and not less than all) of the then-issued and outstanding shares of Series A. Upon such redemption, the Company will pay or deliver, as applicable, to each holder in respect of each share of Series A held by such holder, an amount equal to the greater of (A) cash in an amount equal to the Redemption Price and (B) the amount of cash and/or other assets (including securities) such holder would have received had each share of Series A held by such holder as of the close of business on the business day immediately prior to the effective date of such transaction resulting in a Change of Control, converted into a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the then-applicable Conversion Ratio and participated in such transaction resulting in such Change of Control as a holder of shares of Common Stock (such greater amount, the “Change of Control Redemption Price”). If, in connection with a transaction resulting in a Change of Control, the Company or its successor shall not have sufficient funds legally available under the Nevada law governing distributions to stockholders to redeem all outstanding shares of Series A, then the Company shall (A) redeem, pro rata among the holders, a number of shares of Series A equal to the number of shares of Series A that can be redeemed with the maximum amount legally available for the redemption of such shares of Series A under the Nevada law governing distributions to stockholders, and (B) redeem all remaining shares of Series A not redeemed because of the foregoing limitations at the applicable Change of Control Redemption Price as soon as practicable after the Company (or its successor) is able to make such redemption out of assets legally available for the purchase of such share of Series A. The inability of the Company (or its successor) to make a redemption payment for any reason shall not relieve the Company (or its successor) from its obligation to affect any required redemption when, as and if permitted by applicable law. Holder Right to Request Redemption On each of August 1, 2029, August 1, 2032, and the August 1, 2035, the majority holders shall have the right, upon no less than six months prior written notice to the Company, to request that the Company redeem all (and not less than all) of the then-outstanding shares of Series A, at the Redemption Price. In the event of a holder optional redemption, the Redemption Price shall be payable, and the shares of Series A redeemed by the Company, in three equal installments, commencing on August 1, 2029, August 1, 2032, or August 1, 2035, as applicable, and in each case on the fifteenth- and thirtieth-month anniversary thereafter (each a ""Redemption Date”). On each Redemption Date for a holder optional redemption, the Company shall redeem, on a pro rata basis in accordance with the number of shares of Series A owned by each holder, that number of outstanding shares of Series A determined by dividing (i) the total number of shares of Series A outstanding immediately prior to such Redemption Date by (ii) the number of remaining Redemption Dates (including the Redemption Date to which such calculation applies). If, on any Redemption Date, Nevada law governing distributions to stockholders or the terms of any indebtedness of the Company to banks and other financial institutions engaged in the business of lending money prevent the Company from redeeming all share of Series A to be redeemed, the Company shall ratably redeem the maximum number of shares that it may redeem consistent with such law, and shall redeem the remaining shares as soon as it may lawfully do so under such law. If any shares of Series A scheduled for redemption on a Redemption Date are not redeemed for any reason on such Redemption Date, (x) from such Redemption Date until the fifteen-month anniversary of such Redemption Date, the dividend rate with respect to such unredeemed share of Series A shall automatically increase to 8 % per annum, (y) from such fifteenth-month anniversary of such Redemption Date until the thirtieth-month anniversary of such Redemption Date, the dividend rate with respect to such unredeemed share of Series A shall automatically increase to 10 % per annum and (z) from and after such thirtieth-month anniversary of such Redemption Date, the dividend rate with respect to any such unredeemed share of Series A shall automatically increase to 12 % per annum, in each case until such share is duly redeemed or converted. Conversion The shares of Series A may be converted into shares of the Company’s Common Stock pursuant to the Series A Certificate either at the option of the Company or subject to an automatic conversion as discussed below. The Series A was issued with a conversion price of $ 75 which is potentially subject to adjustment pursuant to the Series A Certificate. The Conversion Ratio is calculated as the quotient of (a) the sum of (x) the stated value of such share of F- 22 Series A as of the applicable conversion date, plus (y) of all accrued and unpaid dividends previously added to the stated value of such share of Series A, and without duplication, all accrued and unpaid dividends per share of Series A through the applicable conversion date; divided by (b) the conversion Price as of the conversion date. As of December 31, 2022 , the conversion ratio of the Series A into common was 1 to 5 . At December 31, 2022 , 7,333,330 shares of the Company’s Common Stock are issuable upon conversion of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. The calculations of earnings per share for all periods presented herein during which the Series A was outstanding do not treat conversion of the Series A as if it had occurred, as the effect of conversion would be anti-dilutive. Company Optional Conversion At any time from and after August 1, 2029, provided the Ten-Day VWAP immediately prior to the date the Company delivers a conversion notice to the holders of Series A exceeds the Conversion Price, the Company may elect to convert all, but not less than all, of the outstanding shares of Series A into shares of the Company’s Common Stock. Automatic Conversion The Series A will convert automatically into shares of the Company’s Common Stock upon the occurrence of any of the following, each, an “Automatic Conversion Event”: As of December 31, 2022, the Series A is not probable of becoming redeemable as the most likely method of settlement is through conversion which is likely to occur before the holder right to request redemption becomes exercisable. Other Accounting Matters The Company has adopted Accounting Standards Update 2020-06 (“ASU 2020-06”), effective January 1, 2022. The provisions of ASU 2020-06 prohibit the recognition of a beneficial conversion feature (“BCF”) on preferred shares issued after the adoption of the ASU. The Company adopted ASU 2020-06d for the Preferred Series A for the year ended December 31, 2022. FASB ASC 815 generally requires an analysis of embedded terms and features that have characteristics of derivatives to be evaluated for bifurcation and separate accounting in instances where their economic risks and characteristics are not clearly and closely related to the risks of the host contract. We performed an evaluation and determined the Series A and the host instrument is more akin to equity. The Company identified certain embedded redemption and conversion features which it evaluated for bifurcation and determined no bifurcation of these embedded or conversion features was required. 15. STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY Issuance of common stock pursuant to incentive stock plan exercises During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company issued an aggregate of approximately 1.5 million shares of its common stock pursuant to the exercise of stock options granted under the 2015 Plan. The Company received aggregate proceeds of $ 3.7 million for approximately 1.0 million options exercised for cash, with the balance of the options having been exercised on a ""cashless” basis. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company issued an aggregate of approximately 1.5 million shares of its common stock pursuant to the exercise of stock options granted under the 2015 Plan and 2006 Incentive Plan (collectively, the ""Stock Incentive Plans""). The Company received aggregate proceeds of $ 3.7 million for approximately 1.0 million options exercised for cash, with the balance of the grants having been exercised on a “cashless” basis. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company issued an aggregate of approximately 1.9 million shares of its common stock pursuant to the exercise of stock options granted under the Company’s Stock Incentive Plans. The Company received aggregate proceeds of $ 4.1 million for approximately 1.3 million options exercised for cash, with the balance of the options having been exercised on a ""cashless” basis. June 2021 Public Offering On June 9, 2021, the Company and certain selling stockholders (the ""Selling Stockholders”) entered into an underwriting agreement (the ""Underwriting Agreement”) with UBS Securities LLC and Jefferies LLC, as representatives (the ""Representatives”) of the several underwriters (the ""Underwriters”), relating to the sale of 6,518,267 shares of common stock, par value $ 0.001 per share, of the Company at a public offering price of $ 62.50 per share less underwriting discounts and commissions in a registered public offering (the ""Offering”). The Company and certain Selling Stockholders also granted the Underwriters an option, exercisable for 30 days, to purchase up to an additional 977,740 shares of its common stock. The Underwriters partially exercised their option to purchase 873,141 shares of the Company’s common stock on June 11, 2021; 1, 133,953 of which were sold by the Company and 739,188 of F- 23 which were sold by certain of the Selling Stockholders. The Offering closed on June 14, 2021. The Company issued and sold 1,133,953 shares of common stock, and the Selling Stockholders sold 6,257,455 shares, in the aggregate, of common stock in the Offering. The Offering generated net proceeds for the Company of $ 67,769,386 and net proceeds for the Selling Stockholders of $ 375,447,300 . The Company intends to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the Selling Stockholders. 16. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally, ASC 820 requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized below: Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. Level 3: Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the use of the reporting entity’s own assumptions. The Company engaged a third-party valuation provider to assist in determining the fair value of the 1,466,666 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock issued on August 1, 2022. The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is classified in mezzanine equity, see Note 14, Mezzanine Equity, and the valuation of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock represents a non-recurring fair value measurement. We used a Monte Carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock on August 1, 2022. The Monte Carlo simulation utilized multiple input variables to determine the value of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock including a volatility rate of 45 %, risk free interest rate of 2.69 %, 5.0 % dividend rate, the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the issuance date of $ 98.87 , a debt discount rate of 12.5 % and a discount for lack of marketability attributed to the registration period of the underlying stock. The selected historical volatility was based on Celsius and a certain peer group. The risk-free interest rate was based on the US STRIPS Rate with a corresponding term as of issuance date. The 5.0 % dividend rate is consistent with the provisions of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and with the Company’s past payments made in cash. The debt discount rate was based on estimated credit analysis and corresponding market yields as of the issuance date. The Company applied a nominal discount for lack of marketability with respect to the assumed registration period of the underlying shares. The Company used the relief from royalty method model to determine the fair value of the Brand Name during the year ended December 31, 2022. The fundamental concept underlying this method is that in lieu of ownership, the acquirer can obtain comparable rights to use the subject asset via a license from a hypothetical third-party owner. The Relief from Royalty method utilized multiple input variables to determine the value of the Brand Name including forecasted sales, discount rate, and royalty rates. The selected royalty rate was based on comparable brands. The debt discount rate was based on an expected debt and equity rate of return as of September 30, 2022. The following is a tabular presentation of the non-recurring fair value measurement along with the level within the fair value hierarchy at December 31, 2022: December 31, 2022 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Mezzanine equity: Series A convertible preferred shares $ — $ 824,488 $ — Indefinite-lived intangible assets: Brands — — 446 Total $ — $ 824,488 $ 446 Other than those noted in previous notes, the Company did not have any other non-recurring assets or liabilities measured at fair value at December 31, 2022 and 2021 . 17. INCOME TAXES The domestic and foreign components of the Company's income before provision for income taxes are as follows: 2022 2021 2020 Domestic $ ( 151,551 ) $ ( 4,176 ) $ 8,111 Foreign ( 1,113 ) 117 529 Income (loss) before provision for income taxes $ ( 152,664 ) $ ( 4,059 ) $ 8,640 The provision (benefit) for income taxes consists of the following: Current: 2022 2021 2020 Domestic $ 10,498 $ — $ — State 2,601 1,523 — Foreign — ( 38 ) 116 $ 13,099 $ 1,485 $ 116 F- 24 Deferred 2022 2021 2020 Domestic $ 18,558 $ ( 7,142 ) $ — State and local 4,034 ( 1,878 ) — Foreign ( 1,073 ) ( 461 ) — 21,519 $ ( 9,481 ) $ — Income tax expense (benefit) 34,618 ( 7,996 ) 116 The reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory rate to the Company's effective rate on income before provision (benefit) for income taxes is as follows: 2022 2021 2020 U.S. Statutory federal rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 % State taxes, net of federal benefit ( 3.9 )% ( 12.5 )% 4.4 % Tax effect of Pepsi valuation premium ( 38.9 )% Permanent differences, including stock-based compensation — — 6.7 % Stock based compensation ( 0.9 )% 50.5 % — Change in valuation allowance 0.4 % 219.8 % ( 29.8 )% Change in deferred balances — ( 80.6 )% — Other ( 0.4 )% ( 0.9 )% — Effective tax rate ( 22.7 )% 197.2 % 2.3 % The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act introduced a provision to tax global intangible low-taxed income (""GILTI"") of foreign subsidiaries and a measure to tax certain intercompany payments under the base erosion anti-abuse tax ""BEAT"" regime. For the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, the Company did not generate intercompany transactions that met the BEAT threshold but does have to include GILTI relating to the Company's foreign subsidiaries. The Company elected to account for GILTI as a current period cost. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts for income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following: December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Net operating loss carryforwards $ 4,774 $ 6,685 Charitable contributions 17 17 Fixed assets ( 1,158 ) ( 627 ) Pepsi valuation premium ( 70,637 ) Right of use liability 154 134 Right of use asset ( 146 ) ( 122 ) Distributor termination fees 46,859 — Uncertain tax position — 132 Stock-based compensation 5,236 6,190 Inventory allowance 5,423 800 Intangibles ( 2,516 ) ( 3,317 ) Total deferred tax (liabilities) assets ( 11,994 ) 9,892 Valuation allowance ( 3,424 ) ( 4,019 ) Net deferred tax (liabilities) assets ( 15,418 ) 5,873 At December 31, 2022, the Company has approximately $ 2.3 million of Federal net operating loss carryforwards and $ 8.7 million of state net operating loss carryforwards, which will begin to expire in 2027. The Federal and State NOLs are subject to limitation under Section 382 due to a December 2008 ownership change of greater than 50 % over a three-year testing period. The ownership change resulted in approximately $ 4.5 million of NOLs that will not be realized. The $ 4.5 million has been removed from the available NOL carryforward and US NOL deferred tax asset. The Company had foreign NOL carryforwards of approximately $ 21.9 million , some of which will begin to expire in 2023. The Company considers the earnings of its foreign entities to be permanently reinvested outside the United States based on estimates that future cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs. Accordingly, deferred taxes have not been recorded for the undistributed earnings of the Company's foreign subsidiaries. All other outside basis differences not related to earnings were impractical to account for at this period of time and are currently considered as being permanent in duration. As required by the authoritative guidance on accounting for income taxes, the Company evaluates the realizability of deferred tax assets on a jurisdictional basis at each reporting date. Accounting for income taxes requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred taxes will not be realized. In circumstances where there is sufficient negative evidence indicating that the deferred tax assets are not F- 25 more likely than not realizable, the Company establishes a valuation allowance. Through the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company maintained a full valuation allowance on its worldwide net deferred tax assets. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company concluded that it is more likely than not that its US deferred tax assets would be realized. This conclusion was based on the US profitability and NOL utilization in 2021 and 2020 as well as future forecasts of US profitability. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company released its US valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of approximately $ 6.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company reported a release of non-U.S. valuation of $ 0.5 million. The Company continues to maintain a valuation allowance on its foreign net operating losses as it is not more likely than not that the losses in those specific jurisdictions will be realized. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: 2022 2021 Gross unrecognized tax benefit, beginning of period $ 1,080 $ 82 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year — — Additions based on tax positions related to the prior years — 998 Reductions due to lapse in statute of limitations and settlements ( 378 ) — Gross unrecognized tax benefit, end of period $ 702 $ 1,080 The Company recognizes only those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold and establishes tax reserves for uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold. To the extent these unrecognized tax benefits are ultimately recognized, approximately $ 0.7 million will impact the Company's effective tax rate in future periods. Interest and penalties associated with income tax matters are included in the provision for income taxes. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had uncertain tax positions of approximately $ 0.8 million , inclusive of $ 0.1 million of interest and penalties. The Company files U.S., state, and foreign income tax returns in jurisdictions with various statutes of limitations. Below is a summary of the filing jurisdictions and open tax years: Open Years U.S. Federal 2019 - 2021 U.S State and local 2018 - 2021 Non-U.S. 2016 - 2021 18. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION The Company adopted the 2006 Incentive Stock Plan on January 18, 2007. This plan was intended to provide incentives to attract and retain highly competent persons at all levels as employees of the Company, as well as independent contractors providing consulting or advisory services to the Company, by providing them opportunities to acquire the Company’s common stock. While the plan terminated 10 years after the adoption date, issued awards have their own schedule of terminations. As such, the Company is no longer granting awards under this plan and there are no unvested awards as of December 31, 2022. The Company adopted the 2015 Plan on April 30, 2015. The 2015 Plan is intended to provide incentives which will attract and retain highly competent persons at all levels as employees of the Company, as well as independent contractors providing consulting or advisory services to the Company, by providing them opportunities to acquire the Company’s common stock or to receive monetary payments based on the value of such shares pursuant to awards issued. The 2015 Plan permits the grant of options and shares for up to 5 million shares. In addition, there is a provision in the 2015 Plan for an annual increase to the maximum number of shares authorized under the 2015 Plan, which increase shall be added on the first day of the calendar year beginning January 1, 2016, equal to 15% of the number of shares outstanding as of such date (Note 15). Provisions have been made to permit the grant of options and other share-based awards for up to 5.0 million shares. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Company recognized non-cash compensation expense of approximately $ 20.7 million , $ 36.5 million , and $ 6.3 million respectively, (included in General and administrative expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations). Stock Options The Company used straight-line amortization of compensation expense over the two to three-year requisite service or vesting period of the grant. The maximum contractual term of the Company's stock options is 10 years. The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur. There are options to purchase approximately 1.9 million shares that have vested as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Under the 2015 Plan, the Company has issued stock options to purchase approximately 2.3 million shares at an average price of $ 9.66 with a fair value of $ 213.9 million . No options were issued during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Upon exercise, shares of new common stock are issued by the Company. The Company determines the fair value of restricted stock-based awards based on the market price on the date of grant. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of its stock option awards and warrant issuances and recognizes forfeitures as they occur. This model uses an exercise price, dividend yields, risk-free interest rate, and expected annual volatility, as inputs. The calculation of the fair value of the awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model is affected by the Company’s stock price on the date of grant as well as assumptions regarding the following: F- 26 Years ended December 31, 2022 (1) 2021 2020 Expected volatility NA 69.2 - 81.1 % 69.2 - 81.1 % Expected term NA 4.5 - 5.0 Years 4.8 - 5.0 Years Risk-free interest rate NA 0.3 % - 1.4 % 0.2 % - 1.4 % Forfeiture Rate NA 0.0 % 0.0 % (1) No stock options were issued during 2022. The expected volatility was determined with reference to the historical volatility of the Company’s stock. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination within the valuation model. The expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury rate in effect at the time of grant. A summary of the status of the Company’s outstanding stock options as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and changes during the periods ended on that date is as follows: Weighted Average Aggregate Weighted Shares Exercise Grant Date Fair Intrinsic Value Average Remaining (000’s) Price Value (000’s) Term (Yrs) Options At December 31, 2020 5,198 $ 4.23 $ 240,866 6.89 Granted 305 42.37 $ 30.32 Exercised ( 1,460 ) 3.85 80.58 84,371 Forfeiture and cancelled ( 443 ) 5.01 At December 31, 2021 3,600 $ 7.47 $ 241,515 6.37 Granted — — Exercised ( 1,273 ) $ 3.67 $ 80.70 $ 102,283 Forfeiture and cancelled ( 61 ) 5.46 At December 31, 2022 2,266 $ 9.66 $ 213,914 5.43 Exercisable at December 31, 2022 1,928 $ 6.41 $ 188,261 5.05 The following table summarizes information about employee stock options outstanding at December 31, 2022: Outstanding Options Vested Options Number Number Outstanding Weighted Weighted Exercisable Weighted Weighted at Average Average at Average Average December 31, Remaining Exercise December 31, Exercise Remaining Range of Exercise Price 2022 (000’s) Life Price 2022 (000’s) Price Life $0.34 - $1.05 30 1.44 $ 0.58 30 $ 0.58 1.44 $1.97 - $2.95 5 3.01 1.97 5 1.97 3.01 $3.23 - $4.85 1,465 5.38 3.81 1,412 3.80 5.34 $5.59 - $8.38 389 3.51 5.70 331 5.72 2.88 $14.53 - $21.79 61 7.58 14.53 40 14.53 7.58 $21.80 - $32.70 16 7.83 21.80 10 21.80 7.83 $42.64 - $63.96 300 8.01 42.67 100 42.67 8.01 Outstanding options 2,266 5.43 $ 9.66 1,928 $ 6.41 5.05 As of December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately $ 3.4 million of unrecognized pre-tax non-cash compensation expense related to options to purchase shares, which the Company expects to recognize, based on a weighted-average period of 1.0 year. Restricted Stock Awards Restricted stock awards are awards of common stock that are subject to restrictions on transfer and to a risk of forfeiture if the holder leaves the Company before the restrictions lapse. The holders of a restricted stock award are generally entitled after the release to transact and obtain the same rights as rights of a stockholder of the Company, including the right to vote the shares. The holders of unvested restricted stock awards do not have the same rights as stockholders including but not limited to any dividends which may be declared by the Company, and do not have the right to vote. The value of restricted stock awards that vest over time is established by the market price on the date of its grant and generally vests over a period of 3 years. A summary of the Company’s restricted stock activity for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is presented in the following table: F- 27 For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Weighted Weighted Average Average Grant Date Grant Date Shares Fair Value Shares Fair Value Unvested at beginning of period 0.3 $ 14.72 66.2 $ 28.11 Transfers to restricted stock units — — ( 45.9 ) 34.02 Granted — — - — Vested — — ( 18.9 ) 14.79 Forfeited and cancelled ( 0.3 ) 14.72 ( 1.1 ) 14.72 Unvested at end of period — $ — 0.3 $ 14.72 There were no shares granted, vested or outstanding during and as of the year ended December 31, 2022. Restricted Stock Units Restricted stock units are awards that give the holder the right to receive one share of common stock for each restricted stock unit upon meeting service-based vesting conditions (typically annual vesting in three equal annual installments, with a requirement that the holder remains in the continuous employment of the Company). The holders of unvested units do not have the same rights as stockholders including but not limited to any dividends which may be declared by the Company, and do not have the right to vote. The value of restricted stock units that vest over time is established by the market price on the date of its grant. A summary of the Company’s restricted stock unit activity for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is presented in the following table: For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Weighted Weighted Average Average Grant Date Grant Date Shares (000's) Fair Value Shares (000's) Fair Value Unvested at beginning of period 566 $ 52.66 — $ — Transfers to restricted stock awards — — 46 34.02 Granted 248 74.14 574 54.40 Vested ( 205 ) 54.17 ( 19 ) 64.58 Forfeited and cancelled ( 70 ) 61.99 ( 35 ) 50.46 Unvested at end of period 539 $ 60.73 566 $ 52.66 The total fair value of shares vested during the year ended December 31, 2022, was approximately $ 11.6 million . Unrecognized compensation expense related to outstanding restricted stock units to employees and directors as of December 31, 2022 was approximately $ 20.3 million and is expected to be expensed over the next 2.0 years. Performance-based Stock Awards The Company issues stock-based awards to third-party consultants for providing marketing, sales, and general business development services related to Celsius products, as well as to certain employees as discussed below. The stock-based awards are in the form of restricted stock units with performance vesting conditions (“performance stock units” or “PSUs”). The holders of unvested PSUs do not have the same rights as stockholders including but not limited to any dividends which may be declared by the Company, and do not have the right to vote. Some of the PSU performance vesting conditions are linked to the consultants obtaining specified incremental earnings for the Company in a given year over the performance vesting period, typically five years and some of the awards are linked to employees of the Company and have specific performance-based metrics to be met in year one and year two of the issuance as discussed below. The fair value of PSUs is based on the market price of the underlying stock on the grant date. The Company recognizes compensation cost for performance stock awards issued to non-employees in the same manner and periods as though cash had been paid for services received. In the third quarter of 2022, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved the issuance of PSUs to certain employees which represented restricted stock units with performance-based vesting. The aggregate grant date fair value of $ 7.5 million included an immediate vesting of 20 % of the shares as well as specific performance-based metrics to be met in year one and year two of the issuance. The Company believes the performance-based metrics are probable of being achieved and will recognize expense each tranche of the awards separately according to ASC 718. A summary of the Company’s PSU activity for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 is presented in the following table: F- 28 For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Weighted Weighted Average Average Grant Date Grant Date Shares (000's) Fair Value Shares (000's) Fair Value Unvested at beginning of period 15 $ 64.65 — $ — Granted 76 98.28 15 64.65 Vested ( 15 ) 98.28 — — Forfeited and cancelled — — — — Unvested at end of period 76 $ 91.48 15 $ 64.65 Unrecognized compensation expense related to outstanding PSUs issued to employees and non-employee consultants as of December 31, 2022, was approximately $ 4.3 million and is expected to be expensed over the next 1.6 years. Modifications There were certain Board of Directors members and employees whose service was terminated during 2021. In connection with their terminations, the vesting conditions of the previously granted awards were modified to accelerate the vesting of specified un-vested awards pursuant to Board resolutions or severance agreements. Pursuant ASC 718, these were modifications which required re-valuation of un-vested awards to modification date fair value with recognition of compensation expense over the remaining service period. The Company modified awards resulting in approximately $ 19.3 million in incremental compensation cost during the year ended December 31, 2021. 19 . COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Legal In November of 2020, McGovern Capital, Inc. and Kevin McGovern (collectively “McGovern”) filed a claim in arbitration related to its Representative Agreement with the Company as amended by the first amendment dated August 6, 2016. Pursuant to the Representative Agreement, McGovern is entitled to receive a fee of three percent ( 3 %) of “Net Revenues” received by the Company from sales of the Company’s products in the People’s Republic of China for a period of four years from Initial Commercial Sale (which was September 1, 2017). “Net Revenues” are defined in the Representative Agreement as “the Company’s revenues net of actual discounts applied, credits and returns.” Effective January 1, 2019, the Company restructured its China operations from a distribution arrangement with Qifeng Food Technology (Beijing) Co. Ltd. (“Qifeng”), to a license and royalty arrangement and a loan, pursuant to which Qifeng will market and distribute the Company’s products in China, and the Company will receive an annual royalty payment. The Company intended to pay McGovern its percentage of the annual royalty payment, but McGovern had objected, claiming that McGovern is entitled to be paid commissions on the entire royalty payment and the amount of the loan to Qifeng. During the year ended December 31, 2022, a confidential settlement agreement was signed for an amount included in the consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income for year ended December 31, 2022 that is not material to the financial results of the Company. In March of 2019, Daniel Prescod filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company in the Superior Court for the State of California, County of Los Angeles, filed on March 19, 2019, (the “Prescod Litigation”). Daniel Prescod asserts that the Company’s use of citric acid in its products while simultaneously claiming “no preservatives” violates California Consumer Legal Remedies Act, California Business and Professions Code Section 17200, et seq., and California Business and Professions Code Section 17500, et seq., because citric acid acts as a preservative. The Company does not use citric acid as a preservative in its products, but rather as a flavoring, and therefore it believes that its “no preservatives” claim is fair and not deceptive. A motion to certify the case as a class action was filed and on August 2, 2021, that motion was granted. No fact discovery was conducted on the merits. On October 12, 2022, the Company and Mr. Prescod notified the courts that an agreement in principle to settle had been reached to resolve the case for an aggregate amount of $ 7.8 million. The Company and Mr. Prescod submitted the settlement agreement to the court, which entered its preliminary approval on November 23, 2022 and set a final Fairness Hearing for March 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2022, $ 7.8 million was accrued and included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets. On November 23, 2021, a case related to the Prescod Litigation, Amit Heli and Joseph Nina v. Celsius Holdings, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Case No. 1:21-cv-09892. The Company answered the complaint on February 11, 2022. Like the Prescod Litigation, the plaintiffs in this case allege that the Company’s use of citric acid in its products while simultaneously claiming “no preservatives” constitutes false advertising and unfair or deceptive trade practices. Unlike the Prescod Litigation, in this case the violations alleged are of New York’s General Business Law. As with the Prescod Litigation, the Company does not use citric acid as a preservative in its products, but rather as a flavoring, and therefore it believes that its “no preservatives” claim is fair and not deceptive. No discovery has been conducted and this matter is still in its initial stages. On October 12, 2022, the Company and Mr. Prescod notified the courts that an agreement in principle to settle had been reached to resolve the Prescod and Heli case for an aggregate amount of $ 7.8 million. The Company and Mr. Prescod submitted the settlement agreement to the court, which entered its preliminary approval on November 23, 2022 and set a final Fairness Hearing for March 31, 2023 for judicial approval and await final judgment and entry in the coming weeks. As of December 31, 2022, $ 7.8 million was accrued and included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets. On January 8, 2021, the Company received a letter from the SEC Division of Enforcement seeking the production of documents in connection with a non-public fact-finding inquiry by the SEC to determine whether violations of the federal securities laws have occurred. Subsequent to January 8, 2021, the Company received subpoenas for production of documents in connection with the matter. The investigation and requests from the SEC do not represent that the SEC has concluded that the Company or anyone else has violated the federal securities laws. The Company has cooperated and will continue to cooperate with the SEC staff in its investigation and requests. At this time, however, the Company cannot predict the length, scope, or results of the investigation or the impact, if any, of the investigation on our results of operations. F- 29 On March 16, 2022, Christian McCallion filed a class action lawsuit against the Company in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. Plaintiff McCallion asserts that because of the Company's delay in filing its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, there was a decline in the market value of the Company’s securities and as a result, class members suffered significant losses and damages. On June 6, 2022 Judge Middlebrooks appointed a lead class plaintiff and the Company filed its Motion to Dismiss on August 5, 2022. As the Company has previously disclosed in its periodic reports filed with the SEC, prior to filing an application for an automatic fifteen (15) day extension of the original filing date, the Company experienced staffing limitations, unanticipated delays and identified material errors in previous filings. The Company does not believe it has committed any federal securities violations or made false and/or misleading statements and/or material omissions as alleged in the complaint. The Company intends to contest the claims vigorously on the merits. On January 11, 2023, Doreen R. Lampert filed a derivative stockholder complaint against certain of the Company’s directors and a former officer and, nominally, against the Company, in the United Stated District Court of the District of Nevada. Plaintiff Lampert asserts that the same allegations giving rise to the McCallion class action lawsuit also support claims for breach of fiduciary duty against the directors and former officer, among other claims. The deadline to respond to the complaint will be March 21, 2023. The Company does not believe its directors or former officer have breached any fiduciary duties or are otherwise liable under the theories plead in the complaint and the Company intends to contest the claims. On May 4, 2021, Plaintiffs Strong Arm Productions USA, Inc., Tramar Dillard p/k/a Flo Rida, and D3M Licensing Group, LLC filed a lawsuit against the Company in the Circuit Court of the 17th Judicial Circuit in and for Broward County, Florida. Plaintiffs asserted that the Company breached two endorsement and licensing agreements that were entered into between Plaintiffs and the Company in 2014 and 2016. Plaintiffs alleged the Company had reached certain revenue and sales benchmarks set forth in the 2014 agreement that entitled them to receive 750,000 shares of the Company's stock. In addition, Plaintiffs claimed they were entitled to receive unspecified royalties under the 2016 agreement. A jury trial commenced on this matter on January 10, 2023. On January 18, 2023, the jury rendered a verdict against the Company for $ 82.6 million in compensatory damages. On February 2, 2023, the Company filed post-trial motions seeking (i) judgment in favor of the Company dismissing the case notwithstanding the verdict based on the plain language of the contracts at issue; (ii) in the alternative, granting a new trial due to the numerous errors at trial; or (iii) in the alternative, reducing the award of damages to $ 2.1 million, which reflects the Company’s stock price on the date that the jury found the relevant revenue and sales benchmarks at issue were met. The judgment will accrue post-judgement interest at 5.52 percent per year as of February 13, 2023 We believe that the jury verdict is not supported by the facts of the case or applicable law, is the result of significant trial error, and there are strong grounds for appeal. We will seek to overturn the verdict in post-trial motions before the trial court and the Company filed a notice of appeal to the Fourth District Court of Appeal for the State of Florida on February 21, 2023. The appeal is suspended pending disposition of the pending post-trial motions. We intend to vigorously challenge the judgment through all appropriate post-trial motions and appeal processes. As a result, we believe that the likelihood that the amount of the judgment will be affirmed is not probable. We have taken into consideration the events that have occurred after the reporting period and before the financial statements were issued. We currently estimate a range of possible outcomes between $ 2.1 million and $ 82.6 million, and we have accrued a liability as of December 31, 2022 at the lower end of the range, which is the amount we believe is the most likely estimate for a probable loss on this matter. This amount is reflected in Accounts payable and accrued expenses, and General and administrative expenses in our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. The ultimate loss to the Company of the litigation matter could be materially different from the amount the Company has accrued. The Company cannot predict or estimate the duration or ultimate outcome of this matter. In addition to the foregoing, from time to time, we may become party to litigation or other legal proceedings that we consider to be a part of the ordinary course of our business. Commitments The Company has entered into distribution agreements with liquidated damages in case the Company cancels the distribution agreements without cause. Cause has been defined in various ways. If management makes the decision to terminate an agreement without cause, an estimate of expected damages is accrued, and an expense is recorded within operating expenses during the period in which termination was initiated. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we have contingent commitment to third parties of $ 30.7 million . Our contingent commitments are primarily related to third party suppliers and have arisen through the normal course of business. The contingent commitments may have various terms, and none are individually significant. Additionally, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by the business and economic uncertainty resulting from the pandemic and public health crises related to the COVID-19 outbreak, which is affecting the macro-economic environment. F- 30 20. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS The Company evaluates subsequent events and transactions that occur after the balance sheet date up to the date the consolidated financial statements are issued. Except for the matters discussed in Note 19, there were no other subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements. F- 31",0001341766,CELH

Business Overview Celsius is a fast-growing company in the functional energy drink and liquid supplement categories in the United States and internationally. We engage in the development, processing, marketing, sale, and distribution of functional drinks and liquid supplements to a broad range of consumers. We believe that we provide differentiated products that offer clinically proven and innovative formulas meant to change the lives of our consumers for the better. We also believe that our brand is attractive to a broad range of customers including fitness enthusiasts. Our core offerings include pre- and post-workout functional energy drinks, as well as protein bars. Our flagship functional energy drink and liquid supplement brands are backed by science, being clinically proven to deliver health benefits by six self-funded studies published in various journals including the Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition, the Journal of the American College of Nutrition, and the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research. These studies have concluded that a single serving of CELSIUS ® burns 100-140 calories (by increasing a consumer’s resting metabolism an average of 12%, while providing sustained energy for up to three hours. Our flagship asset, CELSIUS ® , is a fitness supplement drink which accelerates metabolism and burns calories and body fat while providing energy. This product line comes in two versions, a ready-to-drink supplement format and an on-the-go powder form. We also offer a CELSIUS HEAT and a BRANCH CHAIN AMINO ACIDS line, catered to both pre- and post-workout consumer needs. Our products are currently offered in major retail channels in the US including conventional grocery, natural, convenience, fitness, mass market, vitamin specialty and e-commerce. An integral part of our value proposition is our focus on the functional energy drink and liquid supplement category, ensuring our products have clear and proven benefits. This is why we invest in research and development from the start and utilize our proprietary MetaPlus ® formulation in our portfolio, a blend of ginger root, guarana seed extract, chromium, vitamins, and green tea extract. Potential Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Company’s Business The current COVID-19 pandemic has presented and continues to present a substantial public health and economic challenge around the world and is affecting our employees, communities and business operations, as well as the global economy and financial markets. The human and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the measures taken or that may be taken in the future by governments, businesses (including the Company and our suppliers, bottlers/distributors, co-packers and other service providers) and the public at large to limit the COVID-19 pandemic, have and will directly and indirectly impact our business and results of operations, including, without limitation, the following: 1 Any of the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including those described above, alone or in combination with others, may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and/or financial condition. Any of these negative impacts, alone or in combination with others, could exacerbate many of the risk factors discussed herein, any of which could materially affect our business, reputation, operating results and/or financial condition. Corporate Information We were incorporated in the State of Nevada in April 2005. Our principal executive offices are located at 2424 North Federal Highway, Suite 208, Boca Raton, Florida 33431, and our telephone number is (561) 276-2239. Our website is www.celsiusholdingsinc.com . Information contained on, or that can be accessed through, our website is not incorporated by reference into this Report. Our Products CELSIUS ® calorie-burning functional energy drinks were first introduced to the marketplace in 2005. According to multiple clinical studies we funded, a single serving (12 ounce can) of CELSIUS ® burns 100 to 140 calories by increasing a consumer’s metabolism an average of 12% for up to a three-hour period. In addition, these studies have indicated that drinking a single serving of CELSIUS ® prior to exercising may improve cardiovascular health and fitness and enhance the loss of fat and gain of muscle from exercise. We seek to combine nutritional science with mainstream beverages by using our proprietary thermogenic (calorie-burning) MetaPlus ® formulation, while fostering the goal of healthier everyday refreshment by being as natural as possible without the artificial preservatives often found in many energy drinks or sodas. CELSIUS ® has no chemical preservatives, aspartame or high fructose corn syrup and is very low in sodium. CELSIUS ® uses good-for-you ingredients and supplements such as green tea (EGCG), ginger, calcium, chromium, B vitamins and vitamin C. CELSIUS ® is sweetened with sucralose, a sugar-derived sweetener that is found in Splenda ® , which makes our functional energy drinks low-calorie and suitable for consumers whose sugar intake is restricted. Each 12 ounce can of CELSIUS ® contains 200 milligrams of caffeine which is comparable to one 12-ounce cup of coffee from the leading coffeehouse. We currently have five functional energy drink lines: 2 CELSIUS ® ready-to drink products are packaged in a distinctive 12 ounce sleek can that uses vivid colors in abstract patterns to create a strong on-shelf impact. The cans are sold in various packaging units. We have recently redesigned our packaging to provide a cleaner, crisper and more modern look. In addition to being sugar free, our original ready-to -drink products line is non-GMO, kosher and vegan certified and soy and gluten free. As a result of completion of the acquisition of Func Food in October 2019, we acquired the beverages, protein bars, supplements and superfoods marketed and distributed in Finland, Sweden, and Norway. These products are distributed under the FAST, FitFarm and CocoVi brands and which are owned by Func Food. FAST products is a market leader in Finland and has begun distribution into the Swedish market and in the US. FitFarm and CocoVi are well-established brands of superfoods and other supplements in the Nordic countries. Clinical Studies It is our belief that clinical studies substantiating product claims will become more important as more and more functional energy drinks and other beverages are marketed with health claims. CELSIUS ® was one of the first functional energy drinks to be launched along with a clinical study. CELSIUS ® is also one of very few functional energy drinks that has clinical research on the actual product itself. Some functional energy drink and supplement companies that do mention studies backing their claims are referencing independent studies conducted on one or more of the ingredients in the product. We believe that it is important and will become more important to have studies on the actual product. We have funded seven U.S. based clinical studies for CELSIUS ® . Each was conducted by a research organization and each studied the total CELSIUS ® formula. The first study was conducted by the Ohio Research Group of Exercise Science & Sports Nutrition. The remaining studies were conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of the University of Oklahoma. We funded all of the studies and provided CELSIUS ® functional energy drinks for the studies. However, none of our directors, executive officers or principal stockholders is in any way affiliated with either of the two research organizations which conducted the studies. The first study was conducted in 2005 by the Ohio Research Group of Exercise Science & Sports Nutrition www.ohioresearchgroup.com. The Ohio Research Group of Exercise Science & Sports Nutrition is a multidisciplinary clinical research team dedicated to exploring the relationship between exercise, nutrition, dietary supplements and health. This placebo-controlled, double-blind cross-over study compared the effects of CELSIUS ® and the placebo on metabolic rate. Twenty-two participants were randomly assigned to ingest a 12 ounce serving of CELSIUS ® and on a separate day a serving of twelve ounces of Diet Coke ® . All subjects completed both trials using a randomized, counterbalanced design. Randomized means that subjects were selected for each group randomly to ensure that the different treatments were statistically equivalent. Counterbalancing means that individuals in one group drank the placebo on the first day and drank CELSIUS ® on the second day. The other group did the opposite. Counterbalancing is a design method that is used to control “order effects.” In other words, this was done to make sure that the order that subjects were served does not impact the results and analysis. Metabolic rate (via indirect calorimetry, measurements taken from breaths into and out of calorimeter) and substrate oxidation (via respiratory exchange ratios) were measured at baseline (pre-ingestion) and for ten minutes at the end of each hour for three hours post-ingestion. The results showed an average increase of metabolism of twelve percent over the three-hour period, compared to a statistically insignificant change for the control group. Metabolic rate, or metabolism, is the rate at which the body expends energy. This is also referred to as the “caloric burn rate.” Indirect calorimetry calculates heat that living organisms produce from their production of carbon dioxide. It is called “indirect” because the caloric burn rate is calculated from a measurement of oxygen uptake. Direct calorimetry would involve the subject being placed inside the calorimeter for the measurement to determine the heat being produced. Respiratory Exchange Ratio is the ratio oxygen taken in a breath compared to the carbon dioxide breathed out in one breath or exchange. Measuring this ratio can be used for estimating which substrate (fuel such as carbohydrate or fat) is being metabolized or ‘oxidized’ to supply the body with energy. The second study was conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2007. This blinded, placebo-controlled study was conducted on a total of 60 men and women of normal weight. An equal number of participants were separated into two groups to compare one serving (a single 12 ounce can) of CELSIUS ® to a placebo of the same amount. According to the study, those subjects consuming CELSIUS ® burned significantly more calories versus those consuming the placebo, over a three-hour period. The study confirmed that over the three-hour period, subjects consuming a single serving of CELSIUS ® burned 65% more calories than those consuming the placebo drink and burned an average of more than 100 to 140 calories compared to the placebo. These results were statistically significant. The third study, conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2007, extended our second study with the same group of 60 individuals and protocol for 28 days and showed the same statistical significance of increased calorie burn (minimal attenuation). While the University of Oklahoma study did extend for 28 days, more testing would be needed for long term analysis of the CELSIUS ® calorie-burning effects. Also, although these studies were on relatively small numbers of subjects, they have statistically significant results. Additional studies on a larger number and wider range of body compositions can be considered to further the analysis. Our fourth study, conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2009, combined CELSIUS ® use with exercise. This ten-week placebo-controlled, randomized and blinded study was conducted on a total of 37 subjects. Participants were randomly assigned into one of two groups: Group 1 consumed one serving of CELSIUS ® per day, and Group 2 consumed one serving of an identically flavored and labeled placebo 3 beverage. Both groups participated in ten weeks of combined aerobic and weight training, following the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines of training for previously sedentary adults. The results showed that consuming a single serving of CELSIUS ® prior to exercising may enhance the positive adaptations of exercise on body composition, cardio-respiratory fitness and endurance performance. According to the preliminary findings, subjects consuming a single serving of CELSIUS ® lost significantly more fat mass and gained significantly more muscle mass than those subjects consuming the placebo — a 93.75% greater loss in fat and 50% greater gain in muscle mass, respectively. The study also confirmed that subjects consuming CELSIUS ® significantly improved measures of cardio-respiratory fitness and the ability to delay the onset of fatigue when exercising to exhaustion. Our fifth study was conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2009. This ten-week placebo-controlled, randomized and blinded study was conducted on a total of 27 previously sedentary overweight and obese female subjects. Participants were randomly assigned into groups that consumed identically tasting treatment drinks with exercise or without exercise. All participants consumed one drink, either placebo or CELSIUS ® , per day for 10 weeks. The exercise groups participated in ten weeks of combined aerobic and weight training, following the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines of training for previously sedentary adults. No changes were made to their diet. The results showed that consuming a single serving of CELSIUS ® prior to exercising may improve cardiovascular health and fitness and enhance the positive adaptations of exercise on body composition. According to the preliminary findings, subjects consuming a single serving of CELSIUS ® lost significantly more fat mass and gained significantly more muscle mass when compared to exercise alone — a 46% greater loss in fat, 27% greater gain in muscle mass, respectively. The study also confirmed that subjects consuming CELSIUS ® significantly improved measures of cardio-respiratory fitness — 35% greater endurance performance with significant improvements to lipid profiles — total cholesterol decreases of 5 to 13% and bad LDL cholesterol 12 to 18%. Exercise alone had no effect on blood lipid levels. Our sixth study was conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2009. This ten-week placebo-controlled, randomized and blinded study was conducted on a total of 37 previously sedentary male subjects. Participants were randomly assigned into groups that consumed identically tasting treatment drinks with exercise or without exercise. All participants consumed one drink, either placebo or CELSIUS ® , per day for 10 weeks. The exercise groups participated in ten weeks of combined aerobic and weight training, following the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines of training for previously sedentary adults. No changes were made to their diet. The results showed that consuming a single serving of CELSIUS ® prior to exercising may improve cardiovascular health and fitness and enhance the positive adaptations of exercise on body composition. Significantly greater decreases in fat mass and percentage body fat and increases in VO 2 were observed in the subjects that consumed CELSIUS ® before exercise versus those that consumed the placebo before exercise. Mood was not affected. Clinical markers for hepatic, renal, cardiovascular and immune function, as determined by pre-and post-blood work revealed no adverse effects. Our seventh study was conducted by Miami Research Institute in 2010 and demonstrated the efficacy and safety of the powders and the shots. This study allows the Company to make the same structure/function claims as its ready to drink products. Manufacture and Supply of Our Products Our functional energy drinks and supplements are produced by established third party beverage co-packers. A co-packer is a manufacturing plant that provides the service of filling bottles or cans for the brand owner. We believe one benefit of using co-packers is that we do not have to invest in the production facility and can focus our resources on brand development, sales and marketing. It also allows us produce in multiple locations strategically placed throughout the country. We purchase most of the ingredients and all packaging materials. The co-pack facility assembles our products and charges us a fee by the case. The shelf life of CELSIUS ® products is specified as 15 to 18 months. Substantially all of the raw materials used in the preparation, bottling and packaging of our products are purchased by us or by our co-packers in accordance with our specifications. Generally, we obtain the ingredients used in our products from domestic suppliers and some ingredients have several reliable suppliers. The ingredients in CELSIUS ® include green tea (EGCG), ginger (from the root), caffeine, B vitamins, vitamin C, taurine, guarana, chromium, calcium, glucuronolactone, sucralose, natural flavors and natural colorings. CELSIUS ® is labeled with a supplements facts panel. We have no major supply contracts with any of our suppliers. We single-source all our ingredients for purchasing efficiency; however, we have identified a second source for our critical ingredients and there are many suppliers of flavors, colorings and sucralose. In case of a supply restriction or interruption from any of the flavor and coloring suppliers, we would have to test and qualify other suppliers that may disrupt our production schedules. Packaging materials, except for our distinctive sleek aluminum cans, are available from multiple sources in the United States; however, due to efficiencies we utilize single source vendor relationships. While the beverage industry has experienced some shortages of cans as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been able to secure adequate supply and have not experienced significant adverse effects from such shortages. We believe that our co-packing arrangements and supply sources are adequate for our present needs. Func Food similarly has its FAST and other products manufactured by independent third parties in the Nordic countries. Distribution Domestic In the United States and elsewhere in North America, CELSIUS ® is sold across many retail segments. They include supermarkets, convenience stores, drug stores, nutritional stores, and mass merchants. We also sell to health clubs, spas, gyms, the military, and e-commerce websites. We distribute our products domestically through a hybrid of direct-store delivery (DSD) distributors and as well as sales direct to retailers (DTR). We are continuing to emphasize the expansion of our DSD distribution network as we believe it has been a key element in opening additional domestic markets and retail segments and increasing sales. 4 Our products are sold online through e-commerce platforms such as Amazon. As a result of the shift to online purchasing by consumers, including additional growth arising from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of the shutdown of various retail outlets, particularly gyms and health clubs in the fitness channel, e-commerce sales have accounted for a growing percentage of our domestic revenue. International We distribute our products in various foreign regions through regional and country-specific distribution partners. In October 2019, we acquired Func Food, our Nordic distribution partner, who markets both our products as well as other products under its own brands. CELSIUS ® intends to use Func Food as a platform to expand product distribution elsewhere in Europe. We market our products in the Asian market, which is one of the most dynamic and fastest-growing, through local distributors in Hong Kong and a license agreement with our partner in China, Qifeng Food Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd. (“ Qifeng ”). While we initially began both local production and preliminary distribution of the CELSIUS ® brand in 2018 through our partnership in Qifeng, effective January 1, 2019, we restructured our China distribution efforts by entering into two separate agreements as it relates to the commercialization of our CELSIUS ® products (i.e., license agreement) and a repayment of investment agreement with Qifeng. Under the license agreement, Qifeng was granted the exclusive license rights to manufacture, market and commercialize CELSIUS ® brand products in China. Qifeng will pay a minimum royalty fee of approximately $7.0 million for the five years of the term of the agreement, transitioning to a volume-based royalty fee, thereafter. Under a separate economic agreement, Qifeng Food will repay the marketing investments made by CELSIUS ® into the China market through 2018, over the same five-year period. The repayment, which was formalized via a note receivable from Qifeng, will need to be serviced even if the licensing agreement is cancelled or terminated. Customer Concentration For the year ended December 31, 2021, Costco and Amazon accounted for approximately 12.7% and 10.1% of our revenue, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2020, those customers accounted for approximately 2.9% and 15.1% of our revenues, respectively. Additionally, Amazon and Publix accounted for approximately 22.7% and 10.3% of our total accounts receivable as of December 31, 2021 and approximately11.3% and 6.0% of our accounts receivable. as of December 31, 2020. Seasonality of Sales As is typical in the functional energy drink and supplement industries, sales of our products are seasonal, with the highest sales volumes generally occurring in the second and third fiscal quarters, which correspond to the warmer months of the year in our major markets. Competition We believe that our CELSIUS ® brand products are one of the few calorie-burning functional energy drink and supplement lines whose effectiveness is supported by clinical studies, which gives us a unique position in the functional energy drink and supplement markets. However, our products do compete broadly with not only functional energy drinks and supplements, but all categories of liquid refreshments. The functional energy drink, supplement and liquid refreshment markets are highly competitive, and include international, national, regional and local producers and distributors, most of whom have greater financial, management and other resources than us. Our direct competitors in the functional energy drink and supplement markets include, but are not limited to The Coca-Cola Company, Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, PepsiCo, Inc., Nestlé, Waters North America, Inc., Hansen Natural Corp., Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Monster Energy, and Red Bull. Proprietary Rights We have registered the CELSIUS ® and MetaPlus ® trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, as well as a number of additional trademarks. We have and will continue to take appropriate measures, such as entering into confidentiality agreements with our contract packers and ingredient suppliers, to maintain the secrecy and proprietary nature of our MetaPlus ® formulation and product formulas. We maintain our MetaPlus ® formulation and product formulas as trade secrets. We believe that trade secrecy is a preferable method of protection for our formulas as patenting them might require their disclosure. Other than a company that is our outsourced production manager, no single member of the raw material supply chain or our co-packers has access to the complete formula. We consider our trademarks and trade secrets to be of considerable value and importance to our business. No successful challenges to our registered trademarks have arisen and we have no reason to believe that any such challenges will arise in the future. As a result of the acquisition of Func Food in October 2019, we have acquired additional brands and tradenames. Government Regulation The production, distribution and sale of our products in the United States is subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act , the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 , the Occupational Safety and Health Act , various environmental statutes and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products. California law requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a component listed by California as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects. The law exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products because the law recognizes no generally applicable quantitative thresholds below which a warning is not required. Consequently, even trace amounts of listed components can expose affected products to the prospect of warning labels. Products containing listed substances that occur naturally in the product or that are contributed to the product solely by a municipal water supply are generally exempt from the warning requirement. While none of our products are required to display warnings under this law, we cannot predict whether an 5 important component of any of our products might be added to the California list in the future. We also are unable to predict whether or to what extent a warning under this law would have an impact on costs or sales of our products. Measures have been enacted in various localities and states that require that a deposit be charged for certain non-refillable beverage containers. The precise requirements imposed by these measures vary. Other deposit, recycling or product stewardship proposals have been introduced in certain states and localities and in Congress, and we anticipate that similar legislation or regulations may be proposed in the future at the local, state and federal levels, both in the United States and elsewhere. Our facilities in the United States are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Compliance with these provisions has not had, and we do not expect such compliance to have, any material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations. The marketing and sale of our products internationally is similarly subject to compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations in those foreign countries where our products are sold. Employees As of the date of this Report, the Company employs 225 people, including its executive officers. Information about our Executive Officers The following is a description of the business experience and background of Edwin Negron-Carballo, our Chief Financial Officer, who is our only executive officer who is not a member of our board of directors. Edwin Negron-Carballo , 60, became our Chief Financial Officer in July 2018. He is well versed in US GAAP and IFRS as a Certified Public Accountant and has significant experience in mergers and acquisitions. Mr. Negron-Carballo served as the Chief Financial Officer of Concurrent Manufacturing Solutions, LLC from October 2012 to December 2017. Mr. Negron-Carballo’s prior experience also includes working for major companies such as KPMG, Sodexo, S.A., Tyco Healthcare-Latin America, Energizer Battery and Frito-Lay. Item 1A. Risk Factors In addition to the other information contained in this Report, including in “ Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ” and the consolidated financial statement and notes, you should carefully consider the following risks. The risks and uncertainties discussed below and elsewhere in this Report may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently see as immaterial, may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects . Summary of Principal Risk Factors The following is a summary of the principal risks that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. You should read this summary together with the more detailed description of each risk set forth below: ● The COVID-19 pandemic, and newly emerging variants of COVID-19, have had, and we expect will continue to have, certain impacts on our business and operations, and such impacts may have a material adverse or other effect on our business and results of operations. ● We rely on third party co-packers to manufacture our products. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our co-packers and/or their ability to manufacture our products becomes constrained or unavailable to us, our business could suffer. ● We rely on distributors to distribute our products in the Direct Store Delivery sales channel and in international markets. If we are unable to secure such distributors and/or we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing distributors, our business could suffer. ● Our customers are material to our success. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing customers, our business could suffer. ● Increases in costs or shortages of raw materials, increases in co-packing costs and challenges in our distribution efforts could adversely impact our business. ● We are subject to significant competition in the functional energy drink and supplement industries. ● Our inability to innovate successfully and to provide new cutting-edge products could adversely affect our business and financial results. ● Changes in consumer product and shopping preferences may reduce demand for some of our products. ● We derive virtually all of our revenues from functional energy drinks and supplements, and competitive pressure in the functional energy drink and supplement category could adversely affect our business and operating results. ● We compete in an industry that is brand-conscious, so brand name recognition and acceptance of our products are critical to our success and significant marketing and advertising could be needed to achieve and sustain brand recognition. ● Product safety and quality concerns, or other negative publicity (whether or not warranted) could damage our brand image and corporate reputation and may cause our business to suffer. 6 Risk Factors Relating to Our Business Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic The current COVID-19 pandemic has presented and continues to present a substantial public health and economic challenge around the world and is affecting our employees, communities and business operations, as well as the global economy and financial markets. The human and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the measures taken or that may be taken in the future by governments, businesses (including the Company and our suppliers, bottlers/distributors, co-packers and other service providers) and the public at large to limit the COVID-19 pandemic, have and will directly and indirectly impact our business and results of operations, including, without limitation, the following: 7 Any of the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including those described above, alone or in combination with others, may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and/or financial condition. Any of these negative impacts, alone or in combination with others, could exacerbate many of the risk factors discussed herein, any of which could materially affect our business, reputation, operating results and/or financial condition. Consolidation of retailers, wholesalers and distributors in the industry may result in downward pressure on sales prices. Consolidation can cause significant downward pricing pressure and can impose additional costs on us. If we are unable to successfully manage the potential impact of these commercial changes, our financial results may be materially and adversely affected. We rely on third party co-packers to manufacture our products. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our co-packers and/or their ability to manufacture our products becomes constrained or unavailable to us, our business could suffer. We do not directly manufacture our products, but instead outsource such manufacturing to established third party co-packers. These third-party co-packers may not be able to fulfill our demand as it arises, could begin to charge rates that make using their services cost inefficient or may simply not be able to or willing to provide their services to us on a timely basis or at all. In the event of any disruption or delay, whether caused by a rift in our relationship or the inability of our co-packers to manufacture our products as required, we would need to secure the services of alternative co-packers. We may be unable to procure alternative packing facilities at commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time period and any such transition could be costly. In such case, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. We rely on distributors to distribute our products in the DSD sales channel and in international markets. If we are unable to secure such distributors and/or we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing distributors, our business could suffer. We distribute CELSIUS ® in the DSD sales channel by entering into agreements with direct-to-store delivery distributors having established sales, marketing and distribution organizations. We similarly are seeking to expand our international distribution, particularly in the Far East and elsewhere in Asia by entering into agreements with large established distributors who service those markets. Many of our distributors are affiliated with and manufacture and/or distribute other beverage products. In many cases, such products compete directly with our products. The marketing efforts of our distributors are important for our success. If CELSIUS ® proves to be less attractive to our distributors and/or if we fail to attract distributors, and/or our distributors do not market and promote our products with greater focus in preference to the products of our competitors, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Our customers are material to our success. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing customers, our business could suffer. Unilateral decisions could be taken by our distributors, grocery chains, convenience chains, drug stores, nutrition stores, mass merchants, club warehouses and other customers to discontinue carrying all or any of our products that they are carrying at any time, which could cause our business to suffer. Increases in cost or shortages of raw materials or increases in costs of co-packing could harm our business . The principal raw materials used by us are flavors and ingredient blends as well as aluminum cans, the prices of which are subject to fluctuations. We are uncertain whether the prices of any of the above or any other raw materials or ingredients we utilize will rise in the future and whether we will be able to pass any of such increases on to our customers. We do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials. In addition, some of these raw materials, such as our distinctive sleek 12 ounce can, are available from a single or a limited number of suppliers. As alternative sources of supply may not be available, any interruption in the supply of such raw materials might materially harm us. While the functional energy drink and supplement industries have experienced some shortages of cans as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Celsius has been able to secure adequate supply, though potentially at higher cost. To address the industry-wide shortage of aluminum cans, we have imported cans manufactured abroad which affected our margins in 2021 and will continue to affect our margins in 2022. We believe the increased prices, combined with a requirement to prepay for raw materials, will negatively impact our margins. We are unable to accurately predict how these cost trends might evolve prospectively. Such industry-wide shortages of raw materials, including aluminum cans, could from time to time in the future be encountered, which could interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our products and negatively impact our financial performance. Our failure to accurately estimate demand for our products could adversely affect our business and financial results. We may not correctly estimate demand for our existing products and/or new products. Our ability to estimate demand for our products is imprecise, particularly with regard to new products, and may be less precise during periods of rapid growth, including in new markets. If we materially underestimate demand for our products or are unable to secure sufficient ingredients, flavors, sleek aluminum cans and other raw materials for our supplements or experience difficulties with our co-packing arrangements, including production shortages or quality issues, we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis. Moreover, industry-wide shortages of certain ingredients have occurred and could occur, from time to time in the future, resulting in production fluctuations and/or product shortages. We generally do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage this risk. Such shortages could interfere with and/or delay production of certain of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. 8 If we do not accurately anticipate the future demand for a particular product or the time it will take to obtain new inventory, our inventory levels may be inadequate and our results of operations may be negatively impacted. If we fail to meet our shipping schedules, we could damage our relationships with distributors and/or retailers, increase our distribution costs and/or cause sales opportunities to be delayed or lost. In order to be able to deliver our products on a timely basis, we need to maintain adequate inventory levels of the desired products. If the inventory of our products held by our distributors and/or retailers is too high, they will not place orders for additional products, which could unfavorably impact our future sales and adversely affect our operating results. Changes in the retail landscape or the loss of key retail or foodservice customers could adversely affect our financial results. Our industry is being affected by the trend toward consolidation in and blurring of the lines between retail channels, particularly in Europe and the United States. Larger retailers may seek lower prices from us, may demand increased marketing or promotional expenditures, and may be more likely to use their distribution networks to introduce and develop private-label brands, any of which could negatively affect our profitability. In addition, discounters and value stores are growing at a rapid pace. Our industry is also being affected by the rapid growth in sales through e-commerce retailers, e-commerce websites, mobile commerce applications and subscription services, which may result in a shift away from physical retail operations to digital channels. As we build our e-commerce capabilities, we may not be able to develop and maintain successful relationships with existing and new e-commerce retailers without experiencing a deterioration of our relationships with key customers operating physical retail channels. If we are unable to successfully adapt to the rapidly changing retail landscape, including the rapid growth in digital commerce, our share of sales, volume growth and overall financial results could be negatively affected. In addition, our success depends in part on our ability to maintain good relationships with key retail customers. The loss of one or more of our key retail customers could have an adverse effect on our financial performance. Significant additional labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products may inhibit sales of affected products. Various jurisdictions may seek to adopt significant additional product labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products as a result of what they contain or allegations that they cause adverse health effects. If these types of requirements become applicable to one or more of our products under current or future environmental or health laws or regulations, they may inhibit sales of such products. For example, under one such law in California, known as Proposition 65, if the state has determined that a substance causes cancer or harms human reproduction, a warning must be provided for any product sold in the state that exposes consumers to that substance, unless the exposure falls under an established safe harbor level or another exemption is applicable. If we were required to add Proposition 65 warnings on the labels of one or more of our supplement products produced for sale in California, the resulting consumer reaction to the warnings and possible adverse publicity could negatively affect our sales both in California and in other markets. Our continued expansion outside of the United States exposes us to uncertain conditions and other risks in international markets. We have continued expanding our sales of our products internationally into a variety of new markets and are currently seeking to expand our international distribution, particularly in East Asia and elsewhere in Asia by entering into agreements with large established distributors who service those markets. As our growth strategy includes further expanding our international business, if we are unable to continue to expand distribution of our products outside the United States, our growth rate could be adversely affected. Although we intend to sell through established distributors in international markets, we have limited or no operating experience in many of such markets and it may be costly to promote our brands in international markets. We face and will continue to face substantial risks associated with foreign distribution and sale of our products, including: economic and/or political instability in various international markets; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; restrictions on or costs relating to the repatriation of foreign profits to the United States, including possible taxes and/or withholding obligations on any repatriations; and tariffs and/or trade restrictions. These risks could have a significant impact on our ability to distribute and sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, distribution and sale of products outside of the United States are subject to risks relating to appropriate compliance with legal and regulatory requirements in local jurisdictions, potentially higher product damage rates if our products are shipped long distances, potentially higher incidence of fraud and/or corruption, credit risk of distributors and potentially adverse tax consequences. Numerous U.S. and International laws including export and import controls affect our ability to compete in international markets. U.S. export control laws and economic and trade sanctions prohibit the provision of certain products and services to U.S. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments and persons. Even though we take precautions to prevent our products from being shipped or provided to embargoed countries and U.S. sanctions targets, they could be shipped, or provided by our distributors, to those countries and targets despite such precautions. The provision of goods in violation of U.S. export controls and/or sanctions could have negative consequences for our business, including government investigations, penalties and reputational harm. We must also comply with U.S. import laws. U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “ FCPA ”) also impact our international activities. We are subject to the FCPA and other laws that prohibit improper payments and offers to foreign officials and political parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Selling products into international markets, including through distributors, creates the risk of unauthorized payments or offers, for which we may be held responsible. Violations of the FCPA or other applicable anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, or other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Changes in export and import regulations, economic sanctions and related laws, shifts in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, changes in the countries, governments or persons targeted by such regulations and the imposition of tariffs may create delays in the introduction and sale of our products in international markets, result in decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations or in some cases, prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries, governments or persons. Actions taken with respect to tariffs or trade relations between the United States and other countries, the products subject to such actions, and actions taken by other countries in retaliation may also have an adverse impact on us. The failure to comply with applicable current or future U.S. import, export control, sanctions 9 and anti-corruption laws, including U.S. Customs regulations, could expose us and our employees to substantial civil or criminal penalties, fines and in extreme cases, incarceration. In addition, if our distributors fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re-export licenses or authorizations, or otherwise act in accordance with applicable laws, we may be adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties. Global or regional catastrophic events could impact our operations and affect our ability to grow our business. Because of our increasingly global presence, our business could be affected by unstable political conditions, civil unrest, protests and demonstrations, large-scale terrorist acts, especially those directed against the United States or other major industrialized countries where our products are distributed, the outbreak or escalation of armed hostilities, major natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, wildfires, tornados, earthquakes or floods, or widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases (such as the COVID-19 pandemic). Such catastrophic events could impact our operations and our supply chain, including the production and/or distribution of our products. Materials and/or personnel may need to mobilize to other locations. Our headquarters and a large part of our operations are located in Florida, a state at greater risk of hurricanes. Some of the raw materials we use, including certain sizes of cans, are available from limited suppliers, and a regional catastrophic event impacting such suppliers could adversely impact our operations. In addition, such events could disrupt global or regional economic activity, which could affect consumer purchasing power and consumers’ ability to purchase our products, thereby reducing demand for our products. If our operations are disrupted or we are unable to grow our business as a result of these factors, our growth rate could decline and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Climate change and natural disasters may affect our business. There is concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures due to increased carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could cause significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. Changing weather patterns could result in decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions, and/or outbreaks of diseases or other health issues, which may limit availability and/or increase the cost of certain ingredients used in our products and could impact the food security of communities around the world. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain and/or impact demand for our products. Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as hurricanes, wildfires, earthquakes or floods, and outbreaks of diseases (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or other health issues may affect our operations and the operation of our supply chain, impact the operations of our distributors and unfavorably impact our consumers’ ability to purchase our products. In addition, public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy, transportation and raw material costs, and may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment. Changes in applicable laws, regulations, standards or practices related to greenhouse gas emissions, packaging and water scarcity, as well as initiatives by advocacy groups in favor of certain climate change-related laws, regulations, standards or practices, may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures and other financial obligations, which could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Sales of our products may also be influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate. Our third-party co-packers use a number of key ingredients in the manufacture of our liquid supplement products and powder packets that are derived from agricultural commodities. Increased demand for food products and decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions of the world as a result of changing weather patterns and other factors may limit the availability or increase the cost of such agricultural commodities and could impact the food security of communities around the world. Weather conditions may influence consumer demand for certain of our supplements, which could have an effect on our operations, either positively or negatively. We depend upon our trademarks and proprietary rights, and any failure to protect our intellectual property rights or any claims that we are infringing upon the rights of others may adversely affect our competitive position. Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to protect our current and future brands and products and to defend our intellectual property rights. We cannot be sure that trademarks will be issued with respect to any future trademark applications or that our competitors will not challenge, invalidate or circumvent any existing or future trademarks issued to, or licensed by, us. Our products are manufactured using our proprietary blends of ingredients. These blends are created by third-party suppliers to our specifications and then supplied to our co-packers. Although all of the third parties in our supply and manufacture chain execute confidentiality agreements, there can be no assurance that our trade secrets, including our proprietary ingredient blends will not become known to competitors. We believe that our competitors, many of whom are more established and have greater financial and personnel resources than we do, may be able to replicate or reverse engineer our processes, brands, flavors, or our products in a manner that could circumvent our protective safeguards. Therefore, we cannot give you any assurance that our confidential business information will remain proprietary. Any such loss of confidentiality could diminish or eliminate any competitive advantage provided by our proprietary information. We must continually maintain, protect and/or upgrade our information technology systems, including protecting us from internal and external cybersecurity threats. Information technology enables us to operate efficiently, interface with customers, maintain financial accuracy and efficiency and accurately produce our financial statements. If we do not appropriately allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, and/or the loss of and/or damage to intellectual property through security breaches, including internal and external cybersecurity threats. Cybersecurity attacks are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software (malware, ransomware and viruses), phishing and social engineering, attempts to gain unauthorized access to networks, computer systems and data, malicious or negligent actions of employees (including misuse of information they are entitled to access) and other forms of electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in business systems, an inability to process customer orders and/or lost customer orders, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. 10 We rely on relationships with third parties, including suppliers, distributors, co-packers, contractors, cloud data storage and other information technology service providers and other external business partners, for certain functions or for services in support of our operations. These third-party service providers and partners, with whom we may share data, are subject to similar risks as we are relating to cybersecurity, privacy violations, business interruption, and systems, as well as employee failures. While we have procedures in place for selecting and managing our relationships with third-party service providers and other business partners, we do not have control over their business operations or governance and compliance systems, practices and procedures, which increases our financial, legal, reputational and operational risk. These third parties may experience cybersecurity incidents that may involve data we share with them or rely on them to provide to us, and the need to coordinate with such third-parties, including with respect to timely notification and access to personnel and information concerning an incident, may complicate our efforts to resolve any issues that arise. We believe that we have adopted appropriate measures including ongoing cybersecurity risk assessments to mitigate potential risks to our technology and our operations from these information technology-related disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to operational interruption, damage to our brand image and private data exposure. Moreover, if our data management systems do not effectively collect, store, process and report relevant data for the operation of our business (whether due to equipment malfunction or constraints, software deficiencies, cybersecurity attack and/or human error), our ability to effectively plan, forecast and execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations will be impaired, perhaps materially. Any such impairment could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the timeliness with which we report our internal and external operating results. If we fail to comply with data privacy and personal data protection laws, we could be subject to adverse publicity, government enforcement actions and/or private litigation, which may negatively impact our business and operating results. We receive, process, transmit and store information relating to certain identified or identifiable individuals (“ personal data ”), including current and former employees, in the ordinary course of business. As a result, we are subject to various U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations relating to personal data. These laws are subject to change, and new personal data legislation may be enacted in other jurisdictions at any time. In the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation (the “ GDPR ”) became effective in May 2018 for all member states. The GDPR includes operational requirements for companies receiving or processing personal data of residents of the European Union different from those that were previously in place and also includes significant penalties for noncompliance. Additionally, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “ CCPA ”), which was enacted in June 2018 and came into effect on January 1, 2020, provides a new private right of action and statutory damages for certain data breaches and imposes operational requirements on companies that process personal data of California residents, including making new disclosures to consumers about data collection, processing and sharing practices and allowing consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties. Changes introduced by the GDPR and the CCPA, as well as other changes to existing personal data protection laws and the introduction of such laws in other jurisdictions, subject the Company to, among other things, additional costs and expenses and may require costly changes to our business practices and security systems, policies, procedures and practices. There can be no assurances that our security controls over personal data, training of personnel on data privacy and data security, vendor management processes, and the policies, procedures and practices we implement will prevent the improper processing or breaches of personal data. Data breaches or improper processing, or breaches of personal data in violation of the GDPR, the CCPA and/or of other personal data protection or privacy laws and regulations, could harm our reputation, cause loss of consumer confidence, subject us to government enforcement actions (including fines), or result in private litigation against us, which may result in potential loss of revenue, increased costs, liability for monetary damages or fines and/or criminal prosecution, thereby negatively impacting our business and operating results. If we fail to manage future growth effectively, our business could be materially adversely affected. We have experienced rapid growth, and anticipate such growth may continue. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we grew from 154 to 225 employees, and expect to continue expanding our hiring and marketing efforts with no assurance that our business or revenue will continue to grow. This growth may place significant demands on management and our operational infrastructure. As we continue to grow, we must manage such growth effectively by successfully integrating, developing and motivating a large number of new employees, while maintaining the beneficial aspects of our company culture. If we do not manage the growth of our business and operations effectively, the quality of our products and efficiency of our operations could suffer and we may not be able to execute on our business plan, which could harm our brand, results of operations and overall business. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that we will achieve our planned growth, or even if we are able to grow as planned, that we will continue to sustain such growth or performance. We may incur material losses as a result of product recall and product liability . We may be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury, illness or death. We also may be required to recall some of our products if they become contaminated or are damaged or mislabeled. A significant product liability judgment against us, or a widespread product recall, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The amount of the insurance we carry is limited, and that insurance is subject to certain exclusions and may or may not be adequate. We rely on our management team and other key personnel. We depend on the skills, experience, relationships, and continued services of key personnel, including our experienced management team. In addition, our ability to achieve our operating goals also depends on our ability to recruit, train, and retain qualified individuals. We compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel, and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract and retain additional talented personnel. Any such loss or failure could adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results. In particular, our continued success will depend in part, on our ability to retain the talents and dedication of key employees. If key employees finalize their employment, become ill as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, or if an insufficient number of employees is retained to maintain effective operations, our business may be adversely affected, and our management team may be distracted. Furthermore, we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any of 11 our key employees who leave or be able to offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms, all of which could adversely affect our procurement and distribution processes, sales and marketing activities, financial processes & condition and results of operations. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) has not passed on the efficacy of our products or the accuracy of any claim we make related to our products. Although six independent clinical studies have been conducted relating to the calorie-burning and related effects of our products, the results of these studies have not been submitted to or reviewed by the FDA. Further, the FDA has not passed on the efficacy of any of our products nor has it reviewed or passed on any claims we make related to our products, including the claim that our products aid consumers in burning calories or enhancing their metabolism. The Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) regulates advertising and may review the truthfulness of and substantiation for any claim we make related to our products. Our advertising activities are subject to regulation by the FTC under the Federal Trade Commission Act. In recent years, the FTC and state attorneys general have initiated numerous investigations of dietary and nutritional supplement companies and products. Any actions or investigations initiated against the Company by governmental authorities or private litigants could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The shifting regulatory environment through the various jurisdictions in which are products are sold necessitates building and maintaining robust systems to achieve and maintain compliance in multiple jurisdictions and increases the possibility that we may violate one or more of the legal requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any applicable laws or regulations, we may be subject to, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, injunctions, or product withdrawals, recalls or seizures, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, our financial condition and results of operations. Risk Factors Relating to Our Industry We are subject to significant competition in the functional energy drink and supplement industries. The functional energy drink and supplement industries are highly competitive. The principal areas of competition are pricing, packaging, distribution channel penetration, development of new products and flavors and marketing campaigns. Our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of manufacturers, most of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution resources and name recognition than we do. Important factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include the taste and flavor of our products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective development of new, unique cutting-edge products, attractive and different packaging, branded product advertising and pricing. Our products compete with all liquid refreshments and with products of much larger and substantially better financed competitors, including the products of numerous nationally and internationally known producers, such as The Coca Cola Company, Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, PepsiCo, Inc., Nestlé, Waters North America, Inc., Hansen Natural Corp., Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Monster Energy and Red Bull. We also compete with companies that are smaller or primarily local in operation. Our products also compete with private label brands such as those carried by supermarket chains, convenience store chains, drug store chains, mass merchants and club warehouses. New competitors continue to emerge, some of which target specific markets of ours as well as the health and wellness space. This may require additional marketing expenditures on our part to remain competitive. The rapid growth in sales through e-commerce retailers, e-commerce websites, mobile commerce applications and subscription services, and closures of physical retail operations, particularly during, and potentially following, the COVID-19 pandemic, may result in a shift away from physical retail operations to digital channels and a reduction in impulse purchases. Further, the ability of consumers to compare prices on a real-time basis using digital technology puts additional pressure on us to maintain competitive prices. Sales in gas chains may also be affected by improvements in fuel efficiency and increased consumer preferences for electric or alternative fuel-powered vehicles, which may result in fewer trips by consumers to gas stations and a corresponding reduction in purchases by consumers in convenience gas retailers. We have been growing our e-commerce sales by using Amazon and leveraging our retail partners e-commerce platforms, rather than building our own internal platform. However, if we are unable to successfully adapt to the rapidly changing retail landscape, our share of sales, volume growth and overall financial results could be negatively affected. Due to competition in the functional energy drink and supplement industries, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter difficulties in maintaining our current revenues, market share or position in the functional energy drink and supplement industries. If our revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Our inability to innovate successfully and to provide new cutting-edge products could adversely affect our business and financial results. Our ability to compete in the highly competitive functional energy drink and supplement industries and to achieve our business growth objectives depends, in part, on our ability to develop new flavors, products and packaging. The success of our innovation, in turn, depends on our ability to identify consumer trends and cater to consumer preferences. If we are not successful in our innovation activities, our business, financial condition and results of operation could be adversely affected. Changes in consumer product and shopping preferences may reduce demand for some of our products. The functional energy drink and supplement categories are subject to changing consumer preferences and shifts in consumer preferences may adversely affect us. There is increasing awareness of and concern for health, wellness and nutrition considerations, including concerns regarding caloric intake associated with sugar-sweetened drinks and the perceived undesirability of artificial ingredients. Our products do not contain the artificial preservatives often found in many 12 energy drinks and sodas. CELSIUS ® has no artificial preservatives, aspartame or high fructose corn syrup and is very low in sodium. The main CELSIUS ® line of products are sweetened with sucralose, a sugar-derived sweetener that is found in Splenda ® , which makes our liquid supplements low-calorie. However, consumer preferences may shift away from the trend towards healthier options that we have observed, and as such, there can be no assurance that our current products and product lines will maintain their current levels of demand. There are also changes in demand for different packages, sizes and configurations. This may reduce demand for our functional energy drinks and liquid supplements, which could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our results of operations. Consumers are seeking greater variety in their functional energy drinks and supplements. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our continued ability to develop and introduce different and innovative drinks and supplements that appeal to consumers. In order to retain and expand our market share, we must continue to develop and introduce different and innovative supplements and be competitive in the areas of efficacy, taste, quality and price, although there can be no assurance of our ability to do so. There is no assurance that consumers will continue to purchase our products in the future. Product lifecycles for some functional energy drink and supplement brands, products and/or packages may be limited to a few years before consumers’ preferences change. The functional energy drink and supplements we currently market are in varying stages of their product lifecycles, and there can be no assurance that such products will become or remain profitable for us. We may be unable to achieve volume growth through product and packaging initiatives. We may also be unable to penetrate new markets. Additionally, as shopping patterns are being affected by the digital evolution, with consumers embracing shopping by way of mobile device applications, e-commerce retailers and e-commerce websites or platforms, we may be unable to address or anticipate changes in consumer shopping preferences or engage with our consumers on their preferred platforms. If our revenues decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We derive virtually all of our revenues from functional energy drinks and supplements, and competitive pressure in the functional energy drink and supplement category could adversely affect our business and operating results. Our focus is in the functional energy drink and supplement categories, and our business is vulnerable to adverse changes impacting the fitness supplement category and business, which could adversely impact our business and the trading price of our common stock. Virtually all of our sales are derived from our functional energy drink and supplements, including our CELSIUS ® Originals, CELSIUS HEAT, CELSIUS BCCA+ENERGY, CELSIUS ® On-the-Go and CELSIUS ® product lines. Any decrease in the sales of our functional energy drinks and supplements could significantly adversely affect our future revenues and net income. Historically, we have experienced substantial competition from new entrants in the functional energy drink and supplement categories. The increasing number of competitive products and limited amount of shelf space, including in coolers, in retail stores may adversely impact our ability to gain or maintain our share of sales in the marketplace. In addition, certain actions of our competitors, including unsubstantiated and/or misleading claims, false advertising claims and tortious interference in our business, as well as competitors selling misbranded products, could impact our sales. Competitive pressures in the functional energy drink and supplement categories could impact our revenues, cause price erosion and/or lower market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We compete in an industry that is brand-conscious, so brand name recognition and acceptance of our products are critical to our success and significant marketing and advertising could be needed to achieve and sustain brand recognition. Our business is substantially dependent upon awareness and market acceptance of our products and brands by our targeted consumers. Our business depends on acceptance by our independent distributors of our brand as one that has the potential to provide incremental sales growth rather than reduce distributors’ existing beverage sales. The development of brand awareness and market acceptance is likely to require significant marketing and advertising expenditures. There can be no assurance that CELSIUS ® will achieve and maintain satisfactory levels of acceptance by independent distributors and retail consumers. Any failure of the CELSIUS ® brand to maintain or increase acceptance or market penetration would likely have a material adverse effect on business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to successfully manage new product launches, our business and financial results could be adversely affected. Due to the highly competitive nature of the global functional energy drink and supplement sectors, we expect and intend to continue to introduce new products and evolve existing products to better match consumer demand. The success of new and evolved products depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful development and consumer acceptance. Such endeavors may also involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, greater than expected liabilities and expenses, inadequate return on capital, exposure to additional regulations and reliance on the performance of third parties. Our sales are affected by seasonality. As is typical in the functional energy drink and supplement industries, our sales are seasonal. Our highest sales volumes generally occur in the second and third quarters, which correspond to the warmer months of the year in our major markets. Consumer demand for our products is also affected by weather conditions. Cool, wet spring or summer weather could result in decreased sales of our products and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Our business is subject to many regulations and noncompliance is costly . The production, marketing and sale of our functional energy drinks and supplements are subject to the rules and regulations of various federal, state and local health agencies. The marketing and sale of our products internationally is similarly subject to compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations in those foreign countries where our products are sold. If a regulatory authority finds that a current or future product or production run is not in compliance with any of these regulations, we may be fined, or production may be stopped, thus adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, any adverse publicity associated with any noncompliance may damage our reputation and our ability to successfully market our products. Furthermore, the rules and regulations are subject to change from time to time and while we closely monitor developments in this area, we have no way of anticipating whether changes 13 in these rules and regulations will impact our business adversely. Additional or revised regulatory requirements, whether labeling, environmental, tax or otherwise, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Product safety and quality concerns, or other negative publicity (whether or not warranted) could damage our brand image and corporate reputation and may cause our business to suffer. Our success depends in large part on our ability to maintain consumer confidence in the safety and quality of all of our products. We have rigorous product safety and quality standards, which we expect our operations as well as our suppliers to meet. However, despite our strong commitment to product safety and quality, we or our suppliers may not always meet these standards, particularly as we expand our product offerings through innovation or acquisitions into product categories that are beyond our traditional range of functional energy drinks and supplements. If we or our suppliers fail to comply with applicable product safety and quality standards, or if our supplement products taken to the market are or become contaminated or adulterated by any means, we may be required to conduct costly product recalls and may become subject to product liability claims and negative publicity, which could cause our business to suffer. Our success also depends on our ability to build and maintain the brand image for our existing products, new products and brand extensions and maintain our corporate reputation. There can be no assurance that our advertising, marketing and promotional programs and our commitment to product safety and quality, human rights and environmental sustainability will have the desired impact on our products’ brand image and on consumer preferences and demand. Claims regarding product safety, quality and/or ingredient content issues, efficacy or lack thereof (real or imagined), our culture and our workforce, our environmental impact and the sustainability of our operations, or allegations of product contamination, even if false or unfounded, could tarnish the image of our brands and may cause consumers to choose other products. Consumer demand for our products could diminish significantly if we, our employees, distributors, suppliers or business partners fail to preserve the quality of our products, act or are perceived to act in an unethical, illegal, discriminatory, unequal or socially irresponsible manner, including with respect to the sourcing, content or sale of our products, service and treatment of our customers, or the use of customer data. For example, Celsius’ former managing director of Asia, since leaving the Company, has been charged in connection with 1Malaysia Development Bhd.-related matters. Furthermore, our brand image or perceived product quality could be adversely affected by litigation, unfavorable reports in the media (internet or elsewhere), studies in general and regulatory or other governmental inquiries (in each case whether involving our products or those of our competitors) and proposed or new legislation affecting our industry. For example, we are currently in arbitration proceedings with McGovern Capital, Inc. and Kevin McGovern about a fee dispute emerging from a representative agreement among the parties and Celsius Holdings in connection with sales of our products in the People’s Republic of China for four years starting from September 1, 2017. Negative postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company or any one of our brands, even if inaccurate or malicious, could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the Company. Business incidents, whether isolated or recurring and whether originating from us, our distributors, suppliers or business partners, that erode consumer trust can significantly reduce brand value or potentially trigger boycotts of our products and can have a negative impact on consumer demand for our products as well as our reputation and financial results. The impact of such incidents may be exacerbated if they receive considerable publicity, including rapidly through social or digital media (including for malicious reasons) or result in litigation. In addition, from time to time, there are public policy endeavors that are either directly related to our products and packaging or to our business. These public policy debates can occasionally be the subject of backlash from advocacy groups that have a differing point of view and could result in adverse media and consumer reaction, including product boycotts. Similarly, our sponsorship relationships could subject us to negative publicity as a result of actual or alleged misconduct by individuals or entities associated with organizations we sponsor or support. Likewise, campaigns by activists connecting us, or our supply chain, with human and workplace rights, environmental or animal rights issues could adversely impact our corporate image and reputation. Allegations, even if untrue, that we are not respecting the human rights found in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights; actual or perceived failure by our suppliers or other business partners to comply with applicable labor and workplace rights laws, including child labor laws, or their actual or perceived abuse or misuse of migrant workers; adverse publicity surrounding obesity and health concerns related to our products, our environmental impact and the sustainability of our operations, labor relations, our culture and our workforce or the like could negatively affect our Company’s overall reputation and brand image, which in turn could have a negative impact on our products’ acceptance by consumers. Litigation regarding our products could expose us to significant liabilities and reduce demand for our products. We have been and are a party, from time to time, to various litigation claims and legal proceedings, including, but not limited to, intellectual property, false advertising, product liability, breach of contract claims and others. Other lawsuits have been filed against us claiming that certain statements made in our advertisements and/or on the labels of our products were false and/or misleading or otherwise not in compliance with food standards under local law. Putative class action lawsuits have also been filed against us, alleging that certain claims in our marketing promotional amount to false advertising. We do not believe any statements made by us in our promotional materials or set forth on our product labels are false or misleading or noncompliant with local law, and we have been defending, and will continue to vigorously defend such lawsuits. Any of the foregoing matters or other litigation, the threat thereof, or unfavorable media attention arising from pending or threatened litigation could consume significant financial and managerial resources and result in diminished operational efficiency of the Company, significant monetary awards against us, an injunction barring the sale of any of our products and injury to our reputation. Our failure to successfully defend or settle any litigation or legal proceedings could result in liabilities that, to the extent not covered by our insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, revenue and profitability, and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline. Risk Factors Relating to our Status as a Reporting Public Company We are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act that require us to incur audit fees and legal fees in connection with the preparation of such reports. These additional costs could reduce or eliminate our ability to earn a profit. We are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and as a result, we are now required to file periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “ SEC ”) pursuant to the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. In order to comply with these requirements, our independent registered public accounting firm has to review our financial statements on a quarterly basis and audit our financial statements on 14 an annual basis. Moreover, our legal counsel has to review and assist in the preparation of such reports. The costs charged by these professionals for such services cannot be accurately predicted at this time because factors such as the number and type of transactions that we engage in and the complexity of our reports cannot be determined at this time and will have a major effect on the amount of time to be spent by our auditors and attorneys. However, the incurrence of such costs will obviously be an expense to our operations and thus have a negative effect on our ability to meet our overhead requirements and earn a profit. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our common stock, if a market ever develops, could drop significantly. Our periodic filings as required under the Exchange Act may be subject to review and comment by the SEC, which may result in changes to our public disclosure. Our periodic filings with the SEC in compliance with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, may be subject to review and comment by the SEC. Should the SEC conduct such review and comment, we may be required to revise such periodic filings, including but not limited to the financial statements contained therein. If we do not maintain an effective internal control environment as well as adequate control procedures over our financial reporting, investor confidence may be adversely affected thereby affecting the value of our stock price We are required to maintain proper internal control over our financial reporting and adequate controls related to our disclosures. As defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. If we fail to maintain adequate controls, our business, the results of operations, financial condition and/or the value of our stock may be adversely impacted. The Company has identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting that, if not remediated, could result in additional material misstatements in its consolidated financial statements. As described in Part II, Item 9A — Controls and Procedures , management has identified material weaknesses in the Company's internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The Company is in the process of developing and implementing a remediation plan to address the material weaknesses. If the Company’s remediation efforts are insufficient or if additional material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, the Company's consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and it could be required to revise or restate its financial results, which could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, restrict its ability to access the capital markets, require it to expend significant resources to correct the material weakness, subject it to fines, penalties or judgments, harm its reputation or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence. We face investigation from the SEC, the timeline for which and the results of which are currently unknown. On January 8, 2021, we received a letter from the SEC Division of Enforcement seeking the production of documents in connection with a non-public fact-finding inquiry by the SEC to determine whether violations of the federal securities laws have occurred. On August 20, 2021, the SEC issued a subpoena for production of documents in connection with the matter. Neither the January 8, 2021 SEC letter nor the August 20, 2021 subpoena means that the SEC has concluded that the Company or anyone else has violated the federal securities laws. We have cooperated and will continue to cooperate with the SEC staff in its investigation. At this time, however, we cannot predict the length, scope, or results of the investigation or the impact, if any, of the investigation on our results of operations. We may also be subject to further or other examinations, investigations, proceedings and orders by the SEC or other regulators. Any such further or other actions could be expensive and damaging to our business, results of operations and financial condition. Risk Factors Related to our Common Stock We cannot guarantee the continued existence of an active established public trading market for our common stock. Our common stock currently is listed for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Trading in stock quoted on the Nasdaq Capital Market may often experience wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance. Market prices for our common stock may also be influenced by a number of other factors, including: 15 Our board of directors has the authority, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with terms that may not be beneficial to common stockholders and with the ability to affect adversely stockholder voting power and perpetuate their control over us. Our Articles of Incorporation allows our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without any vote or further action by our stockholders. Our board of directors has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock. As a result, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation, the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock and the right to the redemption of the shares, together with a premium, prior to the redemption of our common stock. Our principal stockholders can exert significant influence on the Company’s corporate affairs. Our principal stockholder owns approximately 25% of our issued and outstanding common stock. Accordingly, they will be able to effectively control the election of directors, as well as all other matters requiring stockholder approval. The interests of our principal stockholders may differ from the interests of other stockholders with respect to the issuance of shares, business transactions with or sales to other companies, selection of other directors and other business decisions. We do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future . We have never paid cash dividends on our common stock. We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock at any time in the foreseeable future. The future payment of dividends directly depends upon our future earnings, capital requirements, financial requirements and other factors that our board of directors will consider. Since we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock, return on your investment, if any, will depend solely on an increase, if any, in the market value of our common stock. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. Not applicable. Item 2. Properties. We do not own any real property. We lease our principal executive offices located at 2424 N Federal Highway, Boca Raton, Florida 33431.

The Company has no warehouses or other facilities as we store our product at third party contract warehouse facilities. We also have leased premises in Europe which have an aggregate monthly cost of approximately $11,600. These leases have different periods and extend until August 2023. Item 3. Legal Proceedings. In addition to other matters previously reported in our periodic filings under the Exchange Act, from time to time, we may become party to litigation or other legal proceedings that we consider to be a part of the ordinary course of our business.

You should read the following discussion in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the corresponding notes, the unaudited financial statements and the corresponding notes included elsewhere in this information statement. This Item 7 contains forward-looking statements. The matters discussed in these forward-looking statements are subject to risk, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those made, projected or implied in the forward-looking statements. Please refer to “ Item 1A. Risk Factors ” for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. Results of Operations Year ended December 31, 2021 compared to year ended December 31, 2020 Revenue For the year ended December 31, 2021, revenue was approximately $314.3 million, an increase of $183.5 million or 140% from $130.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Approximately 97% of this growth was as a result of increased revenues from North America where 2021 revenues were $273.0 million, an increase of $177.5 million or 186% from 2020. The balance of the increase was largely attributable to a 13% growth in European revenues to $38.1 million in 2021 from $33.7 million in 2020. Asian revenues (which primarily consist of royalty revenues from our China licensee) for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $2.5 million, an increase of $1.4 million from $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Other international markets generated $0.6 million in revenues during the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase of approximately 48.5% from $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The total increase in revenue from 2020 to 2021 was largely attributable to increases in sales volume, as opposed to increases in product pricing. The primary factors behind the increase in North American sales volume were related to continued strong triple-digit growth in traditional distribution channels, combined with an increase in and optimization of our products’ presence in world class retailers. Additionally, the continued expansion of DSD network resulted in significant growth of our distributor revenues when compared to the prior year period. Furthermore, our fitness and vending channels also reflected triple digit growth of incremental revenue when compared to the prior year period, during which many fitness facilities were closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, e-commerce results also contributed to the increase in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021. Furthermore, the favorable currency fluctuations accounted for approximately 29 % o f the increase in European revenue in the 2021 period, when compared to the 2020 period. The following table sets forth the amount of revenues by category and changes therein for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020: Year Ending December 31, Revenue Source 2021 2020 Total Revenue $ 314,271,559 $ 130,725,777 North American Revenue $ 273,004,795 $ 95,480,310 European Revenue $ 38,097,016 $ 33,727,441 Asian Revenue $ 2,538,099 $ 1,092,703 Other Revenue $ 631,649 $ 425,323 Gross profit For the year ended December 31, 2021, gross profit increased by approximately $67.2 million or 110% to $128.2 million, from $61.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Gross profit margins decreased to 40.8% for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 46.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in gross profit dollars is related to increases in sales volumes, while the decrease in gross profit margins from the 2020 period to the 2021 period is mainly related to increases in raw material costs (primarily aluminum cans), ocean freight costs, distribution costs, repackaging costs and processing costs. These incremental costs are directly related to added complexities in the supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in gross profit dollars of approximately $67.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2020 to the year ended December 31, 2021, includes approximately $85.0 million related to volume increases, as well as a favorable currency impact of $1.3 million, which was offset in part by unfavorable increases in costs of approximately $18.3 million. Sales and marketing expenses Sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were approximately $74.7 million, an increase of approximately $39.9 million or 114% from approximately $34.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was largely a result of incremental marketing investment activities of approximately $22.5 m illion from the 2020 period. Additionally, employee costs increased by approximately $5.6 m illion from the year ago period as we continued to invest in this area in order to have the proper infrastructure to support our growth and incurred additional travel and business expenses now that we are able to resume in-person marketing events and selling activities. Similarly, we experienced increases in other sales expense in the amount of approximately $1.3 million mainly related to trade-marketing activities to support our continued expansion of our DSD network. Lastly, storage and distribution as well as broker costs accounted for the remainder of the increase in this area in the amount of $10.4 mill ion when compared to the prior year period, mainly related to the increase in business volume. 19 General and administrative expenses General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 were approximately $57.5 million, an increase of $39.3 million or 216% from $18.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This increase was primarily attributable to stock option expense which amounted t o $36.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, an increase from $6.3 million in the prior year period. This increase in stock option expense when compared to the prior year, was mainly attributable the revaluation of certain share-based payment awards that were modified during 2021. Management deems it very important to motivate employees by providing them ownership in the business in order to promote over performance which translates into the continued success of our business based on key performance attributes. Additionally, employee costs for the year ended December 31, 2021 reflect an increase o f $3.1 million or 68.9%, a s investments in this area were also required to properly support our higher business volume and the commercial and operational areas of the business, as well as travel expenses are now being incurred. Administrative expenses amounted to $11.0 million or an increase of $5.4 million or 96.4%, when compared to the prior year period. This variance is mainly related to an increase in bad debt reserve of $1.5 millio n and increases in audit costs, legal expenses, insurance costs and office rent account for the majority of the remaining fluctuation of $3.9 million. Depreciation and amortization had an increase of approximately $0.2 million when compared to the prior year due to investments in operational equipment (e.g., coolers). All other administrative expenses which were mainly composed of research, development and quality control testing, increased by approximately $0.5 million from the 2020 p eriod. Other Income/(expense) Total net other income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $31,069 which reflects a decrease of $697,957 when compared to net total other income of $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The variance of $0.7 million is mainly related to a decrease in foreign currency exchange fluctuation of $1.6 million, and a decrease in interest income of $39,000 related to the note receivable from our China licensee, which are offset by the reductions of bo nd amortization and net interest expense, as well as other all other non-operational charges which provided a total net increase of $0.9 million. Income tax benefit/(expense) An income tax benefit of approximately $8.0 million was obtained during the 2021 year, mainly related to the release of our US valuation allowance and windfall benefits on stock-based compensation awards. In 2020 our Sweden subsidiary incurred approximately $116,000 of income tax expense due to the inability to fully utilize the NOLs generated from prior periods. Net Income/Loss Net income for the year ended December 31, 2021, was $3.9 million or $0.05 per share based on a weighted average of 73,781,130 shares outstanding and dilutive earnings per share of $0.05 based on a fully-dilutive weighted average of 77,688,501 shares outstanding, which includes the dilutive impact of outstanding stock options to purchase 3,907,371 shares. In comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2020 the Company had net income of $8.5 million or $0.12 per share based on a weighted average of 70,195,085 shares outstanding, and a dilutive earnings per share of $0.11 based on a weighted average of 74,443,601 shares outstanding. Liquidity and Capital Resources General As of December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, we had cash of approximately $16.3 million and $43.2 million, respectively, and working capital of approximately $169.2 million and $66.8 million, respectively. In addition to cash flow from operations, our primary sources of working capital have been private placements and public offerings of our securities, including an underwritten public offering of 1,133,953 shares at an offering price of $62.50 per share completed on June 14, 2021 and a private placement of 1,437,909 shares at a price of $15.30 completed on August 25, 2020. Our current operating plan for the next twelve (12) months reflects sufficient financial resources, notwithstanding the potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Cash flows (used in) provided by operating activities Cash flows used in operating activities totaled $96.6 million in 2021, which compares to $3.4 million net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020. The use of cash was primarily driven by higher inventory levels in order to properly service the demand for our products and to mitigate the current inefficiencies of the supply chain. Additionally, the significant increase in business volume or revenue resulted in an increase in our accounts receivable based on the credit terms offered to our clients. Pre-payments or deposits to procure inventory reflected a reduction and therefore were a source of cash. We also leveraged the use of our accounts payable to partially offset the increase in working capital by efficiently utilizing the terms offered by our vendors as it relates to the commitments and disbursements for the goods and services that are needed for our operations. Cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities Cash flows used in investing activities totaled $1.3 million in 2021, which compares to cash provided by investing activities of $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The change in the cash used in investing activities when compared to the 2020 period was primarily due to the investment of approximately $3.1 m illion mainly pertaining to operational equipment which was partially offset by note receivable payments from our China licensee of approximately $1.9 million. Cash flows (used in) provided by financing activities 20 Cash flows provided by financing activities totaled $71.4 million for 2021, representing a $55.8 million increase from $15.6 million in 2020. The increase of cash provided by financing activities is mainly related to the net proceeds of $67.8 million from our June 2021 public offering and proceeds from stock option exercises of $3.7 million, which was offset in part by payments of approximately $94,000 pertaining to financial leases. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we are required to make judgments and estimates that significantly affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. Our estimates are based on historical experience, current trends and various other assumptions we believe to be relevant under the circumstances. We review the underlying factors used in our estimates regularly, including reviewing the significant accounting policies impacting the estimates, to ensure compliance with U.S. GAAP. However, due to the uncertainty inherent in our estimates, actual results may be materially different. We have identified the accounting estimates below as critical to understanding and evaluating the financial results reported in our consolidated financial statements. For a complete description of our significant accounting policies, see Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , Note 2, ""Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"". Valuation Allowances for Deferred Tax Assets Deferred tax assets arise when we recognize expenses in our financial statements that will be allowed as income tax deductions in future periods. Deferred tax assets also include unused tax net operating losses that we are allowed to carry forward to future years. Accounting rules permit us to carry deferred tax assets on the balance sheet at full value as long as it is “more likely than not” that the deductions, losses or credits will be used in the future. A valuation allowance must be recorded against a deferred tax asset if this test cannot be met. Our determination of valuation allowances is based upon a number of assumptions, judgments and estimates, including forecasted earnings, future taxable income and the relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Concluding that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is significant negative evidence that is objective and verifiable, such as cumulative losses in recent years. We have deferred tax assets related to foreign net operating losses, primarily in China, Hong Kong, Sweden, Finland and Norway, against which we have recorded valuation allowances as it is currently not more likely than not that the foreign net operating losses will be realized in the future. We have deferred tax assets related to US Federal and state net operating losses on which we retained a full valuation allowance through September 30, 2021. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we concluded that it is more likely than not that the US deferred tax assets would be realized. This conclusion was based on US profitability and NOL utilization in 2021 and 2020 as well as future forecasts of US profitability. This positive evidence supported the release of the Federal and State valuation allowance. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company reported a release of its US valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of approximately $6.0 milli on Goodwill and Intangible Assets Valuation We evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or when an interim triggering event occurs that would indicate impairment may have taken place. We evaluate our other definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when evidence exists that certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Judgments and assumptions are required in such impairment evaluations. Our annual impairment test of indefinite-lived intangible assets was performed as of October 1, the first day of our last fiscal quarter. Our annual impairment test of indefinite-lived intangible assets was performed as of October 1, the first day of the last fiscal quarter. Our annual impairment evaluation of goodwill involves both qualitative and quantitative aspects, including comparing our single reporting unit's fair value to its respective carrying value. Some of the qualitative aspects evaluated included macro-economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors regarding our raw materials and operations and overall financial performance of our business. If the fair value exceeds carrying value, then we conclude that no goodwill impairment has occurred. If the reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, we would recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess up to the total amount of goodwill. We use the income approach to determine the fair value of our definite-lived customer relationships intangible asset. Our projections used in the income approach to determine the fair value of our definite-lived customer relationships intangible asset include assumptions for growth rates of sales, costs, and profits, which are based on various long-range financial and operational plans. Additionally, discount rates used in the definite-lived intangible analysis are based on a weighted-average cost of capital, driven by the prevailing interest rates in the geographies where the company operates, as well as credit ratings, financing abilities and opportunities, among other factors. Discount rates may differ slightly to adjust for country or market specific risk, among other factors. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill and intangible assets being impaired in future periods. Additionally, disruptions to our business such as prolonged recessionary periods or unexpected significant declines in operating results could result in impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets in future periods. Changes in the factors used in our fair value estimates, including the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, cost inflation or other margin erosion, and discount rates used, could have a significant impact on the fair values of the reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible assets. 21 Item 7. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. While the Company is a newly designated “ large accelerated ” filer as of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, it is not required to satisfy the larger reporting company disclosure requirements until the first quarter after the fiscal year in which this determination is made. As such, the Company may continue to apply the scaled disclosure requirements described in Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K, which permits a “ smaller reporting company ” to omit Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure Not applicable. 22 Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. Disclosure controls and procedures Background Subsequent to filing the Company’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended June 30, 2021, and September 30, 2021, the Company determined that the calculation of expense of share based compensation related to grants of stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) issued to former employees and retired directors was materially understated during the three-and six-month periods ended June 30, 2021 and three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2021 (the “Affected Periods”), based on the application of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. During the Affected Periods, the stock options and RSUs were modified and the expense should have been calculated and recognized using the fair market value of the awards as of the date of modification and recognized over the remaining service period. In order to properly account for the modifications, the Company has withdrawn reliance on previously reported unaudited consolidated financial statements for the three- and six- months ended June 30, 2021 and three- and nine-months ended September 30, 2021 and has restated the unaudited consolidated financial statements for those periods in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed on March 1, 2022 and ""Unaudited Supplementary Information"" included in ""Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Report. The conclusions that management reached in its evaluations of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, are described below in detail. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms adopted by the SEC, including to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial and accounting officer), or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our President and Chief Executive Officer as well as our Chief Financial Officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based on that evaluation, our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report because of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described below. Notwithstanding the conclusion by our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer that our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2021 were not effective, and notwithstanding the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below, management believes that the consolidated financial statements and related financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as of the dates presented, and for the periods ended on such dates, in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and financial officers and effected by the Company’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013) (the “ COSO Framework ”). A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 23 As of December 31, 2021, management has identified the following material weaknesses in internal controls: As a result of the material weaknesses described above, the Company’s management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2021, our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective. Remediation Plan As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, management is re-assessing the design of controls and modifying processes designed to improve our internal control over financial reporting and remediate the control deficiencies that led to the material weaknesses, including but not limited to, (a) enhancing monitoring and oversight controls in the application of U.S. GAAP guidance pertaining to modifications of share-based payments, (b) hiring additional accounting and IT personnel with appropriate technical skillsets, (c) improving consistency in change management supported by standard operating procedures to govern the authorization, testing and approval of changes to information technology systems supporting all of the Company’s internal control processes, (d) enhancing design and implementation of our control environment, including the expansion of formal accounting and IT policies and procedures and financial reporting controls, and (e) implementing appropriate timely review and oversight responsibilities within the accounting and financial reporting functions. Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting Except for the determination by management of the material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting described above, there have been no other changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2021, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Celsius Holdings, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weaknesses described below on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, Celsius Holdings, Inc. (the Company) has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on the COSO criteria. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weaknesses have been identified and included in management’s assessment. Management has identified material weaknesses related to a) the Company’s failure to design effective controls related to the Company’s evaluation of modifications to share-based payment arrangements; b) ineffectively designed and operating information technology general controls (ITGCs) throughout a substantial portion of the year ended December 31, 2021, which resulted in ineffective business process controls (automated and IT-dependent manual controls); and c) the Company’s failure to fully implement components of the COSO framework, including elements of the control environment, information and communication, control activities and monitoring activities components, relating to: (i) providing sufficient and timely management oversight and ownership over the internal control evaluation process; (ii) hiring and training sufficient personnel to timely support the Company’s internal control objectives; (iii) performing timely monitoring and oversight to ascertain whether the components of internal control are present and functioning effectively. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2021 consolidated financial statements of the Company. The material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2021 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated March 16, 2022, which expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion ﻿ The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. ﻿ We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. ﻿ Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. ﻿ Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting ﻿ A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. ﻿ Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2021. Boca Raton, Florida March 16, 2022 F- 2 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm ﻿ The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Celsius Holdings, Inc. ﻿ Opinion on the Financial Statements ﻿ We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Celsius Holdings, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. ﻿ We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March 16, 2022 expressed an adverse opinion thereon. ﻿ Basis for Opinion ﻿ These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. ﻿ We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. F- 3 Valuation of indefinite-lived intangible assets Description of the Matter At December 31, 2021, the Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the acquired brands from the 2019 Func Foods Acquisition were $3.2M. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, intangibles with indefinite lives are tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if the Company believes indicators of impairment exist. The Company measured the fair value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets using a relief from royalty method. Auditing the Company's annual impairment test related to these indefinite-lived intangible assets was complex due to the estimation uncertainty in determining their fair values. The significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of these intangible assets included forecasted sales, discount rates and royalty rates. These significant assumptions are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions, which can vary significantly and depend on market forces and events outside of the Company’s control. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit To test the estimated fair value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the valuation methodology used, the significant assumptions discussed above, and the underlying data used by the Company. Such data includes historical sales, future business plans, as well as data from comparable companies. We compared the significant assumptions to current industry or economic trends, the Company’s business model, and other relevant factors. We involved our valuation specialists to assist in our procedures to test the discount rate, which included comparison of the selected discount rate to the weighted average cost of capital of the Company and other comparable companies and the risk associated with the projected cash flows, and the royalty rate, which included comparing management’s selected royalty rate to royalty rates for similar intangible assets in the Company’s industry. In addition, we assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates by comparing them to actual operating results and performed sensitivity analyses of the significant assumptions described above to evaluate the impact on the fair value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2021. Boca Raton, Florida March 16, 2022 F- 4 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Celsius Holdings, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Celsius Holdings, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2020, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Collectability of Note Receivable Description of the Matter Effective January 1, 2019, the Company entered into a separate economic agreement for the repayment of its marketing investment in China with Qifeng. Under the repayment agreement, Qifeng agreed to refund the Company over a five-year period. The repayment was formalized via a Note Receivable (“Note”) from Qifeng. The initial outstanding principal under the Note was approximately $12.2 million and was denominated in the Chinese Renminbi (CNY). Installment payments under the Note are due on March 31 each year and the first installment payment on the Note was due March 31, 2020. This payment was delayed and paid in September 2020 due to the COVID 19 pandemic. The next installment payment due March 31, 2021 will be paid via a release of 62,000 shares of Celsius common stock owned by Qifeng. This release will provide sufficient funds to pay the full amount that is due under the second installment payment. Under a separate guarantee agreement the Company will maintain control over 275,079 Celsius common shares which serves as collateral for the payment on the remaining amounts that will become due over the next three-years. We determined based on the fact pattern noted above the long term collectability of the remaining Note balance was as a critical audit matter. The Note is collateralized by the Company’s shares, however we noted that there is volatility relating to the value of the collateral which is based on the share price of the Company’s stock. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following: 1. Obtaining and testing for reasonableness of management’s analysis to support the collectability of the remaining Note balance. 2. Obtained, a confirmation from Qifeng of the remaining balance due under the Note as of December 31, 2020 as well as confirming their intent and ability to pay the next installment keeping them current with the agreement. 3. Reviewed a signed guarantee letter from Qifeng over the Company shares that are being used as collateral associated with the remainder of the Note. 4. Obtained the Qifeng account F- 5 statement from the Company’s transfer agent verifying the number of shares owned by Qifeng. The value of the collateral shares at December 31, 2020 was in excess of the total note receivable balance as of December 31, 2020. Based on the procedures performed and evidence obtained we concluded that no allowance for collectability was required related to the Note as of December 31, 2020. /s/ Assurance Dimensions We have served as the Company’s auditor from 2017 to 2021 Margate, Florida March 10, 2021 F- 6 Celsius Holdings, Inc.

(the “ Company ” or “ Celsius Holdings ”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on April 26, 2005. On January 24, 2007, the Company entered into a merger agreement and plan of reorganization with Elite FX, Inc., a Florida corporation. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Elite FX, Inc. was merged into the Company’s subsidiary, Celsius, Inc. and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company on January 26, 2007. In addition, on March 28, 2007 the Company established Celsius Netshipments, Inc. a Florida corporation as a subsidiary of the Company. On February 7, 2018, the Company established Celsius Asia Holdings Limited a Hong Kong corporation as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. On February 7, 2018 Celsius China Holdings Limited a Hong Kong corporation became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Celsius Asia Holdings Limited and on May 9, 2018, Celsius Asia Holdings Limited established Celsius (Beijing) Beverage Limited, a China corporation as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Celsius Asia Holdings Limited. On October 25, 2019 , the Company acquired 100 % of Func Food Group, Oyj (“ Func Food ”). The Acquisition was structured as a purchase of all of Func Food’s equity shares and a restructuring of Func Food’s pre-existing debt. Func Food was the Nordic distributor for the Company since 2015. Func Food is a marketer and distributor of nutritional supplements, health food products, and beverages. The Company is engaged in the development, marketing, sale and distribution of “ functional ” calorie-burning functional energy drinks and liquid supplements under the Celsius® brand name. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”) and the rules and regulations of the SEC. Consolidation Policy — The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Celsius Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Significant Estimates — The preparation of consolidated financial statements and accompanying disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions that the Company may undertake in the future, actual results may differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts, allowance for inventory obsolescence, the useful lives of property, fixtures and equipment, impairment of intangible assets & goodwill, valuation of stock-based compensation, and deferred tax asset valuation allowance. Segment Reporting — Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise that engage in business activities, have discrete financial information, and whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker (CODM) to make decisions about allocating resources and to assess performance. Even though we have operations in several geographies, we operate as a single enterprise. Our operations and strategies are centrally designed and executed given that our geographical components are very similar. Our CODM, the CEO, reviews operating results primarily from a consolidated perspective, and makes decisions and allocates resources based on that review. The reason our CODM focuses on consolidated results in making decisions and allocating resources is because of the significant economic interdependencies between our geographical operations and the Company’s U.S. entity. Concentrations of Risk — Substantially all of the Company’s revenue derives from the sale of Celsius ® functional energy drinks and liquid supplements. The Company uses single supplier relationships for its raw materials purchases and filling capacity, which potentially subjects the Company to a concentration of business risk. If a supplier had operational problems or ceased making product available to the Company, operations could be adversely affected. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with high-quality financial institutions. At times, balances in the Company’s cash accounts may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had approximately $ 16.3 million and $ 43.2 million , respectively, in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had the following 10 percent or greater concentrations of revenue with its customers. Specifically, there are two customers that have accounted for approximately 12.7 % and 10.1 % of our revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2021. Those two customers accounted for approximately 2.9 % and 15.1 % of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 . The below table reflects this customer’s evolution as a percentage of our total revenue. 2021 2020 Amazon 10.1 % 15.1 % Costco 12.7 % 2.9 % All other 77.2 % 82.0 % Total 100.0 % 100.0 % At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had the following 10 percent or greater concentrations of accounts receivable with its customers: F- 11 2021 2020 Amazon 22.7 % 11.3 % Publix 10.3 % 6.0 % All other 67.0 % 82.7 % Total 100.0 % 100.0 % Cash Equivalents — The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. At December 31, 2021 and 2020 , the Company did not have any investments with original maturities of three months or less. Accounts Receivable — Accounts receivable are reported at net realizable value. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors pertaining to the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends, and other information. Delinquent accounts are written-off when it is determined that the amounts are uncollectible. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, there was an allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately $ 0.8 million a nd $ 0.5 million, respectively. Inventories — Inventories include only the purchase cost and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the FIFO method. Inventories consist of raw materials and finished products. The Company establishes an inventory reserve to reduce the value of the inventory during the period in which such materials and products are no longer usable or marketable. Specifically, the Company reviews inventory utilization during the past twelve months and also customer orders for subsequent months. If there has been no utilization during the last 12 months and there are no orders in-place in future months which will require the use of inventory item, then inventory item will be included as part of the reserve during the period being evaluated. Management will then specifically evaluate whether these items may be utilized within a reasonable time frame (e.g., 3 to 6 months). At December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company recorded an allowance of approximately $ 2.6 million a nd $ 1.6 million respectively. The changes in the allowance are included in cost of revenue. Property and Equipment — Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation of property and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset generally ranging from three to seven years . Impairment of Long-Lived Assets — In accordance with ASC Topic 360, “Property, Plant, and Equipment” the Company reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is determined regarding a long-lived asset if its carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The carrying amount is not recoverable when it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from use of the asset over its remaining useful life and final disposition. The Company did not record any impairments during the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Long-lived Asset Geographic Data The following table sets forth long-lived asset information which includes property and equipment and lease right of use assets and excludes goodwill and intangibles, where individual countries represent a material portion of the total: December 31, December 31, 2021 2020 United States $ 3,043,105 $ 694,697 Sweden 1,050,476 431,959 Finland 300,581 450,878 Long-lived assets related to foreign operations 1,351,057 882,837 Total long-lived assets-net $ 4,394,162 $ 1,577,534 Goodwill — The Company records goodwill when the consideration paid for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, including related tax effects. Goodwill is not amortized; instead, goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if the Company believes indicators of impairment exist. The Company first assesses qualitative factors such as macro-economic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors as well as other relevant events, to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the Company determines that the fair value is less than the carrying value, the Company will recognize an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying value over its fair value. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we changed the date of our annual impairment test for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets from December 31st to October 1st. This voluntary change was made to better align the timing of the assessment with the Company’s planning and forecasting process and to give the Company, which is a newly designated large accelerated SEC filer as of December 31, 2021, additional time to complete the annual assessment in advance of year-end reporting. We believe this change in accounting principle measurement date is preferable under the circumstances. This change in assessment date was applied prospectively and did not delay, accelerate, or avoid a potential impairment charge. As of October 1, 2021, there were no indicators of impairment. Intangible assets – Intangible assets are comprised of customer relationships and brands acquired in a business combination. The Company amortizes intangible assets with a definitive life over their respective useful lives. Assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if the Company believes indicators of impairment exist. We utilize both qualitative and quantitative aspects to evaluate the impairment of our intangible assets. The Company measured the fair value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets using a relief from royalty method. The fair value was estimated by projections to determine the present value of future cash flows that the asset is expected to generate over its lifetime. Our projections used in the valuation included assumptions regarding future growth rates of sales, which are based on various long-range financial and operational plans, the royalty F- 12 rate, and the discount rate. Discount rates used in the indefinite-lived intangible analysis are based on a weighted-average cost of capital, driven by the prevailing interest rates in the geographies where the company operates, as well as credit ratings, financing abilities and opportunities, among other factors. Discount rates may differ slightly to adjust for country or market specific risk, among other factors. We believe our evaluations are consistent with those a market participant would utilize. Revenue Recognition — The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers.” The Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied. Product sales occur once control or title is transferred based on the commercial terms. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods. Product sales are recorded net of variable consideration, such as provisions for returns, discounts and allowances. Such provisions are calculated using historical averages and adjusted for any expected changes due to current business conditions. Consideration given to customers for cooperative advertising is recognized as a reduction of revenue except to the extent that there is a distinct good or service, in which case the expense is classified as selling or marketing expense. Provisions for customer volume rebates are based on achieving a certain level of purchases and other performance criteria that are established on a situation basis. These rebates are estimated based on the expected amount to be provided to the customers and are recognized as a reduction of revenue. The amount of consideration the Company receives and revenue the Company recognizes varies with changes in customer incentives the Company offers to its customers and their customers. Additionally, for any agreements which are 1 year or less, the practical expedient under ASC 340-40-25-4 is applied to expense costs when incurred if the amortization period of the contract asset would have otherwise been recognized in one year or less. Sales taxes and other similar taxes are excluded from revenue. Customer Advances — From time to time the Company requires deposits in advance of delivery of products and/or production runs. Such amounts are initially recorded as customer advances liability within other current liabilities. The Company recognizes such revenue as it is earned in accordance with revenue recognition policies. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020 , the Company did no t have any customer advances. Advertising Costs — Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. The Company uses mainly radio, local sampling events, sponsorships, endorsements, and digital advertising. The Company incurred advertising expenses of approximatel y $ 36.7 million and $ 14.2 million, during years ending December 31, 2021 and 2020 , respectively. Research and Development — Research and development costs are charged to general and administrative expenses as incurred and consist primarily of consulting fees, raw material usage and test productions of functional energy drinks and liquid supplements. The Company incurred expenses o f approximately $ 1.0 million and $ 0.5 million during years ending December 31, 2021 and 2020 , respectively. Foreign Currency Gain/Losses — Foreign subsidiaries’ functional currency is the local currency of operations and the net assets of foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates. The foreign subsidiaries perform re-measurements of their assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies on a periodic basis and the gain or losses from these adjustments are included in the Statement of Operations as foreign exchange gains or losses. For the year ended December 31, 2021 exchange losses have amounted to approximately $ 0.3 million while during the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized foreign currency gains of approximately $ 1.4 million mainly related to fluctuations in exchange rates. Translation gain and losses that arise from the translation of net assets, as well as exchange gains and losses on intercompany balances of long-term investment nature, are included in other comprehensive income. The Company incurred foreign currency translation net gain during the year ended December 31, 2021 of approximately $ 0.8 million and a gain of approximately $ 0.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. Our operations in different countries required that we transact in the following currencies: Chinese-Yuan Norwegian-Krone Swedish-Krona Finland-Euro Fair Value of Financial Instruments — The carrying value of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate fair value due to their relative short-term maturity and market interest rates. Fair Value Measurements - ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally, ASC 820 requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized below: Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. Level 3: Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the use of the reporting entity’s own assumptions. Other than these noted previously, the Company did not have any other assets or liabilities measured at fair value at December 31, 2021 and 2020 . Income Taxes — The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the provisions of ASC 740-10, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” which requires, among other things, an asset and liability approach to calculating deferred income taxes. The asset and liability approach require the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets for which management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred asset will not be realized. The Company follows the provisions of the ASC 740 -10 related to, Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Positions. When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. In accordance with the guidance F- 13 of ASC 740-10, the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. The Company has adopted ASC 740-10-25 Definition of Settlement, which provides guidance on how an entity should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits and provides that a tax position can be effectively settled upon the completion of an examination by a taxing authority without being legally extinguished. For tax positions considered effectively settled, an entity would recognize the full amount of tax benefit, even if the tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained based solely on the basis of its technical merits and the statute of limitations remains open. The Company’s tax returns for tax years in 2018 through 2020 remain subject to potential examination by the taxing authorities. Earnings per Share — Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income available to stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share are computed using the weighted average number of common and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding during the period. Please refer to the below table for additional details: For the years ended December 31, 2021 2020 Net income $ 3,937,273 $ 8,523,849 Income per share: Basic $ 0.05 $ 0.12 Diluted $ 0.05 $ 0.11 Weighted average shares outstanding: Basic 73,781,130 70,195,085 Effect of dilutive share based awards 3,907,371 4,248,516 Diluted 77,688,501 74,443,601 Share-Based Payments —The Company follows the provisions of ASC Topic 718 “Compensation — Stock Compensation” and related interpretations. As such, compensation cost is measured on the date of grant at the fair value of the share-based payments. Such compensation amounts, if any, are amortized over the respective vesting periods of the grants. On April 30, 2015, the Company adopted the 2015 Stock Incentive Plan. This plan is intended to provide incentives which will attract and retain highly competent persons at all levels as employees of the Company, as well as independent contractors providing consulting or advisory services to the Company, by providing them opportunities to acquire the Company’s common stock. The 2015 Plan permits the grant of options and shares for up to 5,000,000 shares.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements The Company adopts all applicable, new accounting pronouncements as of the specified effective dates. In September 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326) (“ASU 2016-13”), which requires the immediate recognition of management’s estimates of current and expected credit losses. In November 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-19, which makes certain improvements to Topic 326. In April and May 2019, the FASB issued ASUs 2019-04 and 2019-05, respectively, which adds codification improvements and transition relief for Topic 326. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10, which delays the effective date of Topic 326 for Smaller Reporting Companies to interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. We have elected the relief provided. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-11, which makes improvements to certain areas of Topic 326. In February 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-02, which adds an SEC paragraph, pursuant to the issuance of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 119, to Topic 326. Topic 326 is effective for the Company for fiscal years and interim reporting periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2022. F- 14 All new accounting pronouncements issued but not yet effective are not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position except for the previously disclosed above, there have been no new accounting pronouncements not yet effective that have significance to our consolidated financial statements. Liquidity — These financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will be able to continue as a going concern. At December 31, 2021, the Company had an accumulated deficit of approximately $ 51.5 million which includes a net income available to common stockholders of approximately $ 3.9 million for year ended December 31, 2021. During the year ending December 31, 2021 the Company’s net cash used in operating activities totaled approximately $ 96.6 million . As of December 31, 2020, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $ 55.4 million which includes a net income available to common stockholders of $ 8.5 million for year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ending December 31, 2020 the Company’s net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately $ 3.4 million . If our sales volumes do not meet our projections, expenses exceed our expectations, our plans change, we may be unable to generate enough cash flow from operations to cover our working capital requirements. In such case, we may be required to adjust our business plan, by reducing marketing, lower our working capital requirements and reduce other expenses or seek additional financing. Furthermore, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in the global macro-economic environment related to the pandemic and public health crises related to the COVID-19 outbreak. Correction of Immaterial Errors — The company performed immaterial corrections to the previously reported consolidated financial statements related to the Func Foods acquisition in 2019. During the third quarter of 2021, goodwill increased by $ 3.7 million and deferred tax liabilities increased by $ 3.5 million attributable to tax implications of acquired intangible assets that had not been recorded in the purchase accounting treatment acquisition. The impact on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2021, resulted in a $ 0.2 million deferred tax benefit. Correction of previously issued financial statements — Subsequent to filing the Company’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended June 30, 2021, and September 30, 2021, the Company determined that the calculation of expense of share based compensation related to grants of stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) issued to former employees and retired directors was materially understated during the three-and six-month periods ended June 30, 2021 and three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2021 (the “Affected Periods”), based on the application of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. During the Affected Periods, the stock options and RSUs were modified and the expense should have been calculated and recognized using the fair market value of the awards as of the date of modification and recognized over the remaining service period. In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (""SAB"") No. 99, Materiality, and SAB No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements, the Company evaluated the misstatements and based on an analysis of quantitative and qualitative factors determined that the impact of the misstatement to its interim reporting periods ending June 30, 2021, and September 30, 2021, was material. Accordingly, the Company has restated its interim consolidated financial statements for the three- and six-months ended June 30, 2021, and three- and nine- months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, and included that restated financial information within this annual report. See unaudited Selected Quarterly Financial Results for restatements to the Company's previously reported unaudited interim consolidated financial statements that were impacted by this misstatement. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers.” The Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied. Product sales occur once control is transferred, , based on the commercial terms. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods. Product sales are recorded net of variable consideration, such as provisions for returns, discounts and allowances. Such provisions are calculated using historical averages and adjusted for any expected changes due to current business conditions. Consideration given to customers for cooperative advertising is recognized as a reduction of revenue except to the extent that there is a distinct good or service, in which case the expense is classified as selling or marketing expense. Provisions for customer volume rebates are based on achieving a certain level of purchases and other performance criteria that are established on a situation basis. These rebates are estimated based on the expected amount to be provided to the customers and are recognized as a reduction of revenue. The amount of consideration the Company receives and revenue the Company recognizes varies with changes in customer incentives the Company offers to its customers and their customers. Additionally, for any agreements which are 1 year or less, the practical expedient under ASC 340-40-25-4 is applied to expense costs when incurred if the amortization period of the contract asset would have otherwise been recognized in one year or less. Information about the Company’s net sales by geographical location for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 is as follows: For the years ended December 31, December 31, 2021 2020 North America $ 273,004,795 $ 95,480,310 Europe 38,097,016 33,727,441 Asia 2,538,099 1,092,703 Other 631,649 425,323 Net sales $ 314,271,559 $ 130,725,777 All of the Company’s North America revenue is derived from the United States, which is the Company’s country of domicile. Of the Company’s total foreign revenues of approximately $ 41.3 million and $ 35.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 , respectively, Sweden represented the largest foreign portion of total consolidated revenue of approximately $ 26.9 million and $ 23.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. F- 15 License Agreement In January 2019, the Company entered into a license and repayment of investment agreement with Qifeng Food Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd (“Qifeng”). Under the agreement, Qifeng was granted the exclusive license rights to manufacture, market and commercialize Celsius branded products in China. The term of the agreement is 50 years, with annual royalty fees due from Qifeng after the end of each calendar year. The royalty fees are based on a percentage of Qifeng’s sales of Celsius branded products; however, the fees are fixed for the first five years of the agreement, totaling approximately $ 6.9 million, and then are subject to annual guaranteed minimums over the remaining term of the agreement. Under the agreement, the Company grants Qifeng exclusive license rights and provides ongoing support in product development, brand promotion and technical expertise. The ongoing support is integral to the exclusive license rights and, as such, both of these represent a combined, single performance obligation. The transaction price consists of the guaranteed minimums and the variable royalty fees, all of which are allocated to the single performance obligation. The Company recognizes revenue from the agreement over time because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits from the services. The Company uses the passage of time to measure progress towards satisfying its performance obligation because of its ongoing efforts in providing the exclusive license rights including providing continuous access, updates and support. Total revenue recognized under the agreement was approximate ly $ 1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and approximately $ 0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which is reflected in the revenues from Asia. Inventories consist of the following at: December 31, December 31, 2021 2020 Finished goods $ 123,594,177 $ 15,334,386 Raw Materials 70,200,702 4,682,291 Less: Inventory reserve ( 2,573,028 ) ( 1,613,055 ) Inventories $ 191,221,851 $ 18,403,622 Prepaid expenses and other current assets total approximately $ 13.6 million and $ 14.6 million , at December 31, 2021 and 2020 , respectively, and consist mainly of prepaid advances to co-packers related to inventory production, advertising, prepaid insurance, prepaid slotting fees, value added tax payments and deposits on purchases. Note receivable consists of the following at: December 31, December 31, 2021 2020 Note Receivable-current $ 2,587,905 $ 1,885,887 Note Receivable-non-current 7,116,738 9,429,437 Total Note Receivable $ 9,704,643 $ 11,315,324 Effective January 1, 2019, we restructured our China distribution efforts by entering into two separate economic agreements as it relates to the commercialization of our Celsius products (i.e., license agreement) and a repayment of investment agreement with Qifeng. Under the license agreement, Qifeng was granted the exclusive license rights to manufacture, market and commercialize Celsius® brand products in China. Qifeng will pay a minimum royalty fee of approximately $ 6.9 million for the five years of the term of the agreement, transitioning to a volume-based royalty fee, thereafter. Under a separate economic agreement, Qifeng Food will repay the marketing investments made by Celsius into the China market through 2018, over the same five-year period. The repayment, which was formalized via a Note Receivable from Qifeng, will need to be serviced even if the licensing agreement is cancelled or terminated. The note receivable is denominated in Chinese-Yuan. Scheduled principal payments plus accrued interest are due annually on March 31 of each year starting in 2020. The note receivable is recorded at amortized cost and accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to the weighted average of 5% of the outstanding principal up to $5 million and 2% of the outstanding principal above $5 million. On June 12, 2020, it was agreed to fix the interest rate at 3.21 % which reflected the weighted average interest rate for the 5-year period of the Note. For the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, interest income was approximately $ 0.3 million and $ 0.4 million , respectively. The Company assesses the note receivable for impairment at each reporting period, by evaluating whether it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all the contractual principal and interest payments as scheduled in the Note agreement, based on historical experience of Qifeng’s ability to pay, the current economic environment and other factors. If the Note is determined to be impaired, the impairment is measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flows under the Note, discounted at the Note’s effective interest rate. At December 31, 2021, the Note was not deemed to be impaired. As of December 31, 2021, Qifeng is current on all amounts due under the Note and the license agreement. As collateral for the Note, a stock certificate in Celsius Holdings, Inc., which amounts to 122,830 of shares owned by an affiliate under common control with Qifeng is being held at a brokerage account. These shares were originally issued on April 20, 2015 via a private transaction which involved Risejoy Services F- 16 Limited an affiliate under the common control of Qifeng, our Chinese licensee. Payment in-full was received timely pertaining to the amounts due on March 31, 2021. Furthermore, a letter of guarantee was executed with several restrictions regarding these shares. In particular, it was agreed that the stock would not be sold or transferred without the prior written consent from Celsius Holdings, Inc. There are other restrictions and agreements, which include that a Statement of Account will be provided to Celsius on a Quarterly basis to confirm and validate the existence of the shares. These shares serve only as collateral and is a component of management’s consideration when evaluating impairment indicators. The Company’s leasing activities include an operating lease of its corporate office space from a related party (see Note 12) and several other operating and finance leases of vehicles and office space for the Company’s European operations. At the inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. The Company’s assessment is based on: (1) whether the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (2) whether the Company obtains the right to substantially all the economic benefit from the use of the asset throughout the term, and (3) whether the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. The Company allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease and non-lease component based on the component’s relative stand-alone price to determine the lease payments. Lease and non-lease components are accounted for separately. Leases are classified as either finance leases or operating leases based on criteria in ASC Topic 842, “Leases”. The Company’s operating leases are generally comprised of real estate and vehicles, and the Company’s finance leases are generally comprised of vehicles. At lease commencement, the Company records a lease liability equal to the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. A corresponding right-of-use asset (“ROU asset”) is recorded, measured based on the initial measurement of the lease liability. ROU assets also include any lease payments made and exclude lease incentives. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for operating leases, consisting of lease payments, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Included in lease expense are any variable lease payments incurred in the period that were not included in the initial lease liability. Lease expense for finance leases consists of the amortization of the ROU asset on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease term, and interest expense is calculated using the effective interest rate method. The following is a summary of lease cost recognized in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income: Year ended Year ended December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Operating Finance Operating Finance Leases Leases Leases Leases Lease cost in general and administrative expenses: Operating lease expense $ 476,815 $ — $ 384,503 $ — Amortization of finance lease ROU assets — 124,971 — 328,505 Total lease cost in general and administrative expenses 476,815 124,971 384,503 328,505 Lease cost in other expense: Interest on finance lease liabilities — 7,504 — 16,004 Total lease cost in other expense — 7,504 — 16,004 Total lease cost $ 476,815 $ 132,475 $ 384,503 $ 344,509 The following is a summary of the impact of the Company’s leases on the consolidated statements of cash flows: Years ended December 31, 2021 2020 Leasing activity in cash flows from operating activities: Payments under operating leases ( 470,544 ) ( 389,831 ) Interest payments on finance lease liabilities ( 7,431 ) ( 16,004 ) Total leasing activity in cash flows from operating activities ( 477,975 ) ( 405,835 ) Leasing activity in cash flows from financing activities: Principal payments on finance lease liabilities ( 94,102 ) ( 280,208 ) Total leasing activity in cash flows from financing activities: ( 94,102 ) ( 280,208 ) The weighted-average remaining lease terms and weighted-average discount rates for operating and finance leases at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 were as follows: F- 17 December 31, December 31, 2021 2020 Weighted average remaining lease term (years) - operating leases 2.3 2.6 Weighted average remaining lease term (years) - finance leases 0.7 1.1 Weighted average discount rate - operating leases 5.78 % 6.52 % Weighted average discount rate - finance leases 3.01 % 3.95 % The future annual minimum lease payments required under the Company’s leases as of December 31, 2021 are as follows: Operating Finance Future minimum lease payments Leases Leases Total 2022 $ 561,648 $ 160,239 $ 721,887 2023 513,462 45,955 559,417 2024 162,538 — 162,538 2025 5,212 — 5,212 Total future minimum lease payments 1,242,860 206,194 1,449,054 Less: Amount representing interest ( 73,161 ) ( 3,740 ) ( 76,901 ) Present value of lease liabilities 1,169,699 202,454 1,372,153 Less: current portion ( 511,764 ) ( 157,046 ) ( 668,810 ) Long-term portion $ 657,935 $ 45,408 $ 703,343 Property and equipment consist of the following at: December 31, December 31, 2021 2020 Merchandising equipment - coolers $ 3,051,938 $ 394,418 Office equipment 890,695 630,759 Vehicles 304,210 78,124 Less: accumulated depreciation ( 1,066,785 ) ( 523,924 ) Total $ 3,180,058 $ 579,377 Depreciation expense amounted to approximately $ 0.5 million and $ 0.1 million during years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 , respectively.

Intangible assets consist of acquired customer relationships and brands from the Func Food Acquisition.

For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company did not generate intercompany transactions that met the BEAT threshold but does have to include GILTI relating to the Company's foreign subsidiaries. The Company elected to account for GILTI as a current period cost. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts for income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following: F- 20 December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Net operating loss carryforwards $ 6,685,036 $ 12,051,503 Charitable Contributions 17,339 — Fixed Assets ( 627,075 ) ( 50,411 ) Right of Use Liability 134,102 — Right of Use Asset ( 121,895 ) — FIN48 130,298 — Stock-based compensation 6,190,115 389,816 Inventory allowance 800,443 548,118 Intangibles ( 3,316,817 ) — Total deferred tax assets 9,891,546 12,939,026 Valuation allowance ( 4,018,699 ) ( 12,939,026 ) Net Deferred Tax Assets 5,872,847 — At December 31, 2021, the Company has approximately $ 9.6 million of Federal net operating loss carryforwards and $ 14.9 million of state net operating loss carryforwards, which will begin to expire in 2031. The Federal and State NOLs are subject to limitation under Section 382 due to a December 2008 ownership change of greater than 50 % over a three-year testing period. The ownership change resulted in approximately $ 4.5 million of NOLs that will not be utilized prior to expiration. The $ 4.5 million has been removed from the available NOL carryforward and US NOL deferred tax asset. The Company had foreign NOL carryforwards of approximately $ 22.4 million , some of which will begin to expire in 2023. At December 31, 2021, undistributed earnings, as well as outside basis differences, of our foreign subsidiaries was determined to be immaterial and such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. Accordingly, no taxes have been provided thereon. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practicable due to the complexities associated with this hypothetical calculation. As required by the authoritative guidance on accounting for income taxes. the Company evaluates the realizability of deferred tax assets on a jurisdictional basis at each reporting date. Accounting for income taxes requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred taxes will not be realized. In circumstances where there is sufficient negative evidence indicating that the deferred tax assets are not more likely than not realizable, the Company establishes a valuation allowance. Through the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company has maintained a full valuation allowance on its worldwide net deferred tax assets. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company concluded that it is more likely than not that its US deferred tax assets would be realized. This conclusion was based on the US profitability and NOL utilization in 2021 and 2020 as well as future forecasts of US profitability. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company released its US valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of approximately $ 6.0 million. The Company continues to maintain a valuation allowance on its foreign net operating losses as it is not more likely than not that the losses in those specific jurisdictions will be realized. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: 2021 2020 Gross unrecognized tax benefit, beginning of period $ 81,500 $ — Additions based on tax positions related to the current year — 81,500 Additions based on tax positions related to the prior years 998,691 — Reductions due to lapse in statute of limitations and settlements — — Gross unrecognized tax benefit, end of period $ 1,080,191 $ 81,500 The Company recognizes only those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold and establishes tax reserves for uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold. To the extent these unrecognized tax benefits are ultimately recognized, approximately $ 1.1 million will impact the Company's effective tax rate in future periods. Unrecognized tax benefits are likely to decrease by approximately $ 0.8 million , inclusive of interest and penalties, within the next twelve months as a result of the Company's intention to remediate certain income tax positions via voluntary disclosure. Interest and penalties associated with income tax matters are included in the provision for income taxes. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had uncertain tax positions of approximately $ 1.3 million , inclusive of $ 0.2 million of inte rest and penalties. The Company files U.S., state, and foreign income tax returns in jurisdictions with various statutes of limitations. Below is a summary of the filing jurisdictions and open tax years: Open Years U.S. Federal 2018 - 2020 U.S State and local 2017 - 2020 Non-U.S. 2015 - 2020 15. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION F- 21 The Company adopted an Incentive Stock Plan on January 18, 2007. This plan is intended to provide incentives which will attract and retain highly competent persons at all levels as employees of the Company, as well as independent contractors providing consulting or advisory services to the Company, by providing them opportunities to acquire the Company’s common stock. While the plan terminates 10 years after the adoption date, issued options have their own schedule of termination. During 2013, the majority of the stockholders approved to increase the total available shares in the plan from 2.5 million to 3.5 million shares of common stock. During May 2014, the majority of the stockholders approved to increase the total available shares in the plan from 3.5 million to 4.25 million shares of common stock, during February 2015, the majority of the stockholders approved to increase the total available shares in the plan from 4.25 million to 4.6 million shares of common stock and during April 2015, the majority of the stockholders approved to increase the total available shares in the plan from 4.6 million to 5.1 million shares of common stock. Upon exercise, shares of new common stock are issued by the Company. The Company adopted the 2015 Stock Incentive Plan on April 30, 2015. This plan is intended to provide incentives which will attract and retain highly competent persons at all levels as employees of the Company, as well as independent contractors providing consulting or advisory services to the Company, by providing them opportunities to acquire the Company’s common stock or to receive monetary payments based on the value of such shares pursuant to Awards issued. The 2015 Plan permits the grant of options and shares for up to 5,000,000 shares. In addition, there is a provision for an annual increase of 15% of the shares pertaining to the 2015 plan that are outstanding as of the last day of the prior year. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 4.3 million shares are available. Under the 2015 Stock Incentive Plan, the Company has issued options to purchase approximately 3.6 million shares at an average price of $ 7.56 with a fair value of $ 241.5 million. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company issued options to purchase 304,750 and 620,535 shares, respectively. Upon exercise, shares of new common stock are issued by the Company. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized an expense of approximately $ 36.5 million and $ 6.3 million, respectively, of non-cash compensation expense (included in General and Administrative expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations) determined by application of a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following inputs: exercise price, dividend yields, risk-free interest rate, and expected annual volatility. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately $ 7.7 million of unrecognized pre-tax non-cash compensation expense related to options to purchase shares, which the Company expects to recognize, based on a weighted-average period of 1.9 years. The Company used straight-line amortization of compensation expense over the two to three-year requisite service or vesting period of the grant. The maximum contractual term of the Company's stock options is 10 years. The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur. There are options to purchase approximately 2.31 million shares that have vested as of December 31, 2021. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of its stock option awards and warrant issuances. The calculation of the fair value of the awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model is affected by the Company’s stock price on the date of grant as well as assumptions regarding the following: Year ended December 31, 2021 2020 Expected volatility 69.2 % - 81.1 % 69.2 - 81.1 % Expected term 4.5 - 5.0 Years 4.8 - 5.0 Years Risk-free interest rate 0.3 % - 1.4 % 0.2 % - 1.4 % Forfeiture Rate 0.0 % 0.0 % The expected volatility was determined with reference to the historical volatility of the Company’s stock. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination within the valuation model. The expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury rate in effect at the time of grant. A summary of the status of the Company’s outstanding stock options as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 and changes during the periods ending on that date is as follows: Weighted Average Aggregate Weighted Shares Exercise Grant Date Fair Intrinsic Value Average Remaining (000’s) Price Value (000’s) Term (Yrs) Options At December 31, 2019 6,528 $ 3.54 $ 8,978 6.58 Granted 575 7.14 $ 4.66 Exercised ( 1,806 ) 2.83 $ 20.27 31,480 Forfeiture and cancelled ( 99 ) 3.93 At December 31, 2020 5,198 $ 4.23 $ 240,866 6.89 Granted 305 $ 42.37 $ 30.32 Exercised ( 1,460 ) 3.85 $ 80.58 84,371 Forfeiture and cancelled ( 443 ) 5.01 At December 31, 2021 3,600 $ 7.47 $ 241,515 6.37 Exercisable at December 31, 2021 2,314 $ 4.06 $ 163,151 5.49 The following table summarizes information about employee stock options outstanding at December 31, 2021: F- 22 Outstanding Options Vested Options Number Number Outstanding Weighted Weighted Exercisable Weighted Weighted at Averaged Averaged at Averaged Averaged December 31, Remaining Exercise December 31, Exercise Remaining Range of Exercise Price 2021 (000’s) Life Price 2021 (000’s) Price Life $0.20 - $0.53 20 2.08 $ 0.34 20 $ 0.34 2.08 $0.65 - $1.80 100 3.15 $ 1.05 100 $ 1.05 3.15 $1.83 - $2.84 107 4.02 $ 1.97 107 $ 1.97 4.02 $3.20 - $6.20 2,993 6.27 $ 4.16 2,062 $ 4.21 5.68 $7.20-$60.00 380 8.93 $ 37.15 25 $ 15.93 8.63 Outstanding options 3,600 6.37 $ 7.47 2,314 $ 4.06 5.49 As of December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately $ 7.7 million of unrecognized pre-tax non-cash compensation expense related to options to purchase shares, which the Company expects to recognize, based on a weighted-average period of 1.9 years. Restricted Stock Awards Restricted stock awards are awards of common stock that are subject to restrictions on transfer and to a risk of forfeiture if the holder leaves the Company before the restrictions lapse. The holders of a restricted stock award are generally entitled after the release to transact and obtain the same rights as rights of a stockholder of the Company, including the right to vote the shares. The holders of unvested restricted stock awards do not have the same rights as stockholders including but not limited to any dividends which may be declared by the Company, and do not have the right to vote. The value of restricted stock awards that vest over time is established by the market price on the date of its grant and generally vests over a period of 3 years. A summary of the Company’s restricted stock activity for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 is presented in the following table: For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Weighted Weighted Average Average Grant Date Grant Date Shares Fair Value Shares Fair Value Unvested at beginning of period 66,229 $ 28.11 90,000 $ 3.23 Transfers to restricted stock units ( 45,871 ) 34.02 — — Granted — — 175,737 17.46 Vested ( 18,913 ) 14.79 ( 170,145 ) 8.08 Forfeited and cancelled 1,187 14.72 ( 29,363 ) 4.15 Unvested at end of period 258 $ 14.72 66,229 $ 28.11 The total fair value of shares vested during the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was approximately $ 1.3 million and $ 2.9 million , respectively. Unrecognized compensation expense related to outstanding restricted stock awards to employees and directors as of December 31, 2021 was approximately $ 1,096 and is expected to be expensed over the next 0.6 years. Unrecognized compensation expense related to outstanding restricted stock awards to employees and directors as of December 31, 2020 was $ 0.2 million. Restricted Stock Units Restricted stock units are awards that give the holder the right to receive one share of common stock for each restricted stock unit upon meeting service-based vesting conditions (typically annual vesting in three equal annual installments, with a requirement that the holder remains in the continuous employment of the Company). The holders of unvested units do not have the same rights as stockholders including but not limited to any dividends which may be declared by the Company, and do not have the right to vote. The value of restricted stock units that vest over time is established by the market price on the date of its grant. A summary of the Company’s restricted stock unit activity for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 is presented in the following table: For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Weighted Weighted Average Average Grant Date Grant Date Shares Fair Value Shares Fair Value Unvested at beginning of period — $ — — $ — Transfers to restricted stock awards 45,871 34.02 — — Granted 573,428 54.40 — — Vested ( 18,758 ) 64.58 — — Forfeited and cancelled ( 35,000 ) 50.46 — — Unvested at end of period 565,541 $ 52.66 $ — $ — F- 23 The total fair value of shares vested during the year ended December 31, 2021 was approximately $ 1.4 million . Unrecognized compensation expense related to outstanding restricted stock units to employees and directors as of December 31, 2021 was approximately $ 19.8 million and is expected to be expensed over the next 2.4 years. Stock-based Awards Issued to Non-employee Consultants The Company issues stock-based awards to third-party consultants for providing marketing, sales, and general business development services related to Celsius products. The stock-based awards are in the form of restricted stock units with performance vesting conditions (“performance stock units” or “PSUs”). The holders of unvested PSUs do not have the same rights as stockholders including but not limited to any dividends which may be declared by the Company, and do not have the right to vote. The PSU performance vesting conditions are linked to the consultants obtaining specified incremental earnings for the Company in a given year over the performance vesting period, typically five years. The fair value of PSUs is based on the market price of the underlying stock on the grant date. The Company recognizes compensation cost for performance stock awards issued to non-employees in the same manner and periods as though cash had been paid for services received. A summary of the Company’s PSU activity for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 is presented in the following table: For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Weighted Weighted Average Average Grant Date Grant Date Shares Fair Value Shares Fair Value Unvested at beginning of period — $ — — $ — Granted 15,468 64.65 — — Vested — — — — Forfeited and cancelled — — — — Unvested at end of period 15,468 $ 64.65 $ — $ — Unrecognized compensation expense related to outstanding PSUs issued to non-employee consultants as of December 31, 2021 was approximately $ 0.9 million and is expected to be expensed over the next 4.6 years. Modifications There were certain Board of Directors members and employees whose service was terminated during the year. In connection with their terminations, the vesting conditions of the previously granted awards were modified to accelerate the vesting of specified un-vested awards pursuant to Board resolutions or severance agreements. Pursuant ASC 718, these were Type III modifications requiring re-valuation of un-vested awards to modification date fair value with recognition of compensation expense over the remaining service period. The Company modified awards for nine grantees resulting in approximately $ 19.3 million in incremental compensation cost during the year ended December 31, 2021. See Note 2 and Unaudited Supplementary Information for the impact of these modifications on the previously reported unaudited 2021 quarterly consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the periods ending June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2021. 16 . COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES In November of 2020, McGovern Capital, Inc. and Kevin McGovern (collectively ""McGovern”) filed a claim in arbitration related to its Representative Agreement with Celsius Holdings, Inc. as amended by the first amendment dated August 6, 2016. Pursuant to the Representative Agreement, McGovern is entitled to receive a fee of three percent (3%) of ""Net Revenues” received by the Company from sales of the Company’s Products in the People’s Republic of China for a period of four years from Initial Commercial Sale (which was September 1, 2017). ""Net Revenues” are defined in the Representative Agreement as ""the Company’s revenues net of actual discounts applied, credits and returns.” Effective January 1, 2019, the Company restructured its China operations from a distribution arrangement with Qifeng Food Technology (Beijing) Co. Ltd. (""Qifeng”), to a license and royalty arrangement and a note, pursuant to which Qifeng will market and distribute the Company’s products in China, and Celsius will receive an annual royalty payment. The Company intends to pay McGovern its percentage of the annual royalty payment, but McGovern has objected claiming that McGovern is entitled to be paid commissions on the entire royalty payment and the amount of the loan to Qifeng. The Company intends to defend against McGovern’s claims vigorously and has filed a counterclaim related to McGovern’s failure to comply with the covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the Representative Agreement. At this stage in the matter, the Company has fully participated in the producing all documents as required by the discovery process and continues to defend itself vigorously. Based on the current status the Company is unable to predict the outcome at this time. In March of 2019, Daniel Prescod filed a putative class action lawsuit against the Company in the Superior Court for the State of California, County of Los Angeles, Case Number 19STCV09321, filed on March 19, 2019, (the ""Prescod Litigation”). Daniel Prescod asserts that the Company’s use of citric acid in its products while simultaneously claiming ""no preservatives” violates California Consumer Legal Remedies Act, California Business and Professions Code Section 17200, et seq., and California Business and Professions Code Section 17500, et seq., because citric acid acts as a preservative. The Company does not use citric acid as a preservative in its products, but rather as a flavoring, and therefore it believes that its ""no preservatives” claim is fair and not deceptive. A motion to certify the case as a class action was filed and on August 2, 2021, that motion was granted. However, the Company also has a motion for summary adjudication pending and that motion would be dispositive of plaintiff’s claims if granted. No fact discovery has been conducted on the merits and this matter is still in its initial stages. The Company intends to contest the claims vigorously on the merits. Since merits discovery is still in its initial stages, we are unable to predict the outcome at this time. On November 23, 2021, a case related to the Prescod Litigation, Amit Heli and Joseph Nina v. Celsius Holdings, was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Case No. 1:21-cv-09892. Like the Prescod Litigation, the plaintiffs in this case allege that the Company’s use of citric F- 24 acid in its products while simultaneously claiming “no preservatives” constitutes false advertising and unfair or deceptive trade practices. Unlike the Prescod Litigation, in this case the violations alleged are of New York’s General Business Law. Celsius answered the complaint on February 11, 2022. As with the Prescod Litigation, the Company does not use citric acid as a preservative in its products, but rather as a flavoring, and therefore it believes that its “no preservatives” claim is fair and not deceptive. No discovery has been conducted. and this matter is still in its initial stages. The Company intends to contest the claims vigorously on the merits. As a result, we are unable to predict the outcome at this time. On January 8, 2021, we received a letter from the SEC Division of Enforcement seeking the production of documents in connection with a non-public fact-finding inquiry by the SEC to determine whether violations of the federal securities laws have occurred. On August 20, 2021, the SEC issued a subpoena for production of documents in connection with the matter. Neither the January 8, 2021 SEC letter nor the August 20, 2021 subpoena means that the SEC has concluded that the Company or anyone else has violated the federal securities laws. We have cooperated and will continue to cooperate with the SEC staff in its investigation. At this time, however, we cannot predict the length, scope, or results of the investigation or the impact, if any, of the investigation on our results of operations. In addition to the foregoing, from time to time, we may become party to litigation or other legal proceedings that we consider to be a part of the ordinary course of our business. The Company has entered into distribution agreements with liquidated damages in case the Company cancels the distribution agreements without Cause. Cause has been defined in various ways. It is management’s belief that no such agreement has created any liability as of December 31, 2021. Additionally, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by the pandemic and public health crises related to the COVID-19 outbreak which is affecting the macro-economic environment. 17. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS None F- 25 Celsius Holdings, Inc. UNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION December 31, 2021 and 2020 Selected Quarterly Financial Results Subsequent to filing the Company’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended June 30, 2021, and September 30, 2021, the Company determined that certain amounts reported in the Company's previously issued unaudited consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) and consolidated balance sheets contained misstatements (see Note 2 for further details). In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 99, Materiality, management evaluated the materiality of the misstatements from a qualitative and quantitative perspective and concluded that the misstatements were material to the three- and six- months ended June 30, 2021 and the three- and nine- months ended September 30, 2021 interim consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, the Company has restated its interim consolidated financial statements for the three- and six- months ended June 30, 2021, and three- and nine- months ended September 30, 2021, respectively. The effects of the adjustments to the Company's previously reported unaudited 2021 quarterly consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) on a standalone quarter basis are as follows: As Reported Adjustments As Restated Second Quarter Third Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Second Quarter Third Quarter Revenue $ 65,073,323 $ 94,909,100 $ — $ — $ 65,073,323 $ 94,909,100 Gross Profit 28,249,369 37,693,372 — — 28,249,369 37,693,372 General and administrative expenses 1 9,119,532 11,140,030 3,180,353 12,116,438 12,299,885 23,256,468 Total operating expense 24,650,520 33,761,092 3,180,353 12,116,438 27,830,873 45,877,530 Income (loss) from operations 3,598,849 3,932,280 ( 3,180,353 ) ( 12,116,438 ) 418,496 ( 8,184,158 ) Net income (loss) before income taxes 3,960,344 3,579,610 ( 3,180,353 ) ( 12,116,438 ) 779,991 ( 8,536,828 ) Net income (loss) $ 3,960,344 $ 2,745,791 $ ( 3,180,353 ) $ ( 12,116,438 ) $ 779,991 $ ( 9,370,647 ) Net income (loss) per share Basic $ 0.05 $ 0.04 $ ( 0.04 ) $ ( 0.17 ) $ 0.01 $ ( 0.13 ) Diluted $ 0.05 $ 0.03 $ ( 0.04 ) $ ( 0.15 ) $ 0.01 $ ( 0.12 ) 1 In order to correct previously reported share-based compensation for three-months ended June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2021, the Company is recognizing additional share-based compensation expense of $ 3,180,353 and $ 12,116,438 , respectively.

EXPLANATORY NOTE The Company is filing this Form 10-K/A Amendment No. 1 to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 (in response to certain comments of the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “ SEC ”) with respect to our originally filed Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 (the “ 2019 Form 10-K ”). This Form 10-K/A amends the 2019 Form 10-K as follows: Except as described above, this Form 10-K/A does not amend, update, or change any other items or disclosures in the 2019 Form 10-K and does not purport to reflect any information or events subsequent to the filing thereof.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure Not applicable. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. Disclosure controls and procedures Our President and Chief Executive Officer as well as our Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of December 31, 2019, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms adopted by the SEC, including to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial and accounting officer), or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of December 31, 2019, our disclosure controls and procedures were in-effective in that (a) we maintain records that in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (b) our records provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and board of directors; and (c) our records provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. In the Company’s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, originally filed with the SEC on March 12, 2020, the following disclosures were not explicitly detailed: Additionally, the historical financial statements of Func Food that were provided in the Company’s Form 8-K/A filed on January 8, 2020 were not fully aligned with Rule 3-05/8-04 of Regulation S-X. This was due to the fact that (a) Func Food’s annual financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 contained a qualified audit opinion related to estimation of intangible assets and goodwill impairment and intercompany balances of the predecessor parent company, none of which has an impact on the accounting for the acquisition or its post-acquisition operations; and (b) we did not fully provide the required unaudited interim period historical financial statements. Specifically, the Form 8-K/A did not include the interim financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and statements of comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in stockholders’ equity for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 (balance sheet and income statement were included), primarily due to limited ability to obtain such information given that the predecessor Func Food entity was going through a debt restructuring as detailed in the Company’s Exchange Act filings. 1 While we believe there were mitigating circumstances around these areas, the Company nonetheless did not fully satisfy all of the disclosure requirements of the SEC. Accordingly, our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of December 31, 2019, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. Our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer do not expect that our disclosure controls or internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. Although our disclosure controls and procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented if there exists in an individual a desire to do so. There can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on the framework set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013). Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and financial officers and effected by the Company’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: Management has excluded the acquired business from management’s report on internal control over financial reporting. The SEC’s general guidance permits the exclusion of an assessment of the effectiveness of a registrant’s controls and procedures as they relate to its internal control over financial reporting for an acquired business during the first year following such acquisition if, among other circumstances and factors, there is not an adequate amount of time between the acquisition date and the date of assessment. On October 25, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Func Food Group, Oyj (“ Func Food ”) and did not have time to perform an adequate assessment of their internal control environment. In accordance with the SEC guidance, the scope of our evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, did not include an assessment of the internal controls over financial reporting of these acquired operations. Net Revenue generated from the acquired operations only represented 8.8% as of December 31, 2019 and total assets of the acquired business represented approximately 30% of the Company’s total assets as of December 31, 2019. 2 Although we were not able to execute a thorough assessment, we began to perform evaluations of internal controls, on an on-going basis, over financial reporting for these acquired operations as well as their processes and systems with the assistance of a reputable international accounting firm. As such, it was deemed that the acquired operations and financial reporting processes did not have a material impact to our internal controls over financial reporting. As such, we have concluded that controls were effective as of the time of the acquisition and continue to be effective based on the work that has been performed. Additionally, we conducted multiple training sessions with their finance and administrative personnel, as it relates to our internal control environment and policies which were implemented as part of the integration process. Moreover, from a financial reporting perspective we review their figures and conduct thorough analytical reviews of their results and also validate the consolidation of their figures at the European level. Based on the evaluation conducted under the above-referenced framework, our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of December 31, 2019, our internal control over financial reporting was effective. While we did determine that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, as discussed in the preceding section, this did not impact the conclusion that our internal control over financial reporting was effective. Disclosure controls and procedures are those which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. While there is substantial overlap between a company’s disclosure controls and procedures and its internal control over financial reporting, some elements of disclosure controls and procedures are beyond the scope of internal control over financial reporting. We believe the factors which led to the conclusion that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective were of such an isolated nature and impact, that they are beyond the scope of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, as they do not impact or pertain to the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm Effective with the filing of this report, the Company is deemed to be an “ accelerated filer ” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. Accordingly, we have included the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm in Item 8 setting forth our registered public accounting firm’s attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Item 308 (b) of Regulation S-K. Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2019, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 3 Item 15.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Celsius Holdings, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. As described in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded the acquired business of Func Food Group, from management’s report on internal control over financial reporting. We also excluded the acquired business from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2019 and 2018 Business —Celsius Holdings, Inc. (the “ Company ” or “ Celsius Holdings ”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on April 26, 2005. On January 24, 2007, the Company entered into a merger agreement and plan of reorganization with Elite FX, Inc., a Florida corporation. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Elite FX, Inc. was merged into the Company’s subsidiary, Celsius, Inc. and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company on January 26, 2007. In addition, on March 28, 2007 the Company established Celsius Netshipments, Inc. a Florida corporation as two subsidiaries of the Company. On February 7, 2018, the Company established Celsius Asia Holdings Limited a Hong Kong corporation as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. On February 7, 2018 Celsius China Holdings Limited a Hong Kong corporation became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Celsius Asia Holdings Limited and on May 9, 2018, Celsius Asia Holdings Limited established Celsius (Beijing) Beverage Limited, a China corporation as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Celsius Asia Holdings Limited. On September 3, 2019 the Company established Celsius European Holdings B.V. as a wholly- owned subsidiary of the Company. On October 25, 2019, Func Food Group Oyj became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Celsius European Holdings B.V. The Company is engaged in the development, marketing, sale and distribution of “ functional ” calorie-burning fitness beverages under the Celsius® brand name. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”). Consolidation Policy — The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Celsius Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All material inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Significant Estimates — The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts, reserves for inventory obsolescence, the useful lives and values of property, fixtures, equipment and intangible assets, valuation of goodwill, valuation of stock-based compensation, and deferred tax asset valuation allowance. Segment Reporting — Although the Company has a number of operating divisions, separate segment data has not been presented, as they meet the criteria for aggregation as permitted by ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting, (formerly Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 131, Disclosed About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.) F- 8 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2019 and 2018 Concentrations of Risk — Substantially all of the Company’s revenue derives from the sale of Celsius ® beverages. The Company uses single supplier relationships for its raw materials purchases and filling capacity, which potentially subjects the Company to a concentration of business risk. If these suppliers had operational problems or ceased making product available to the Company, operations could be adversely affected. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with high-quality financial institutions. At times, balances in the Company’s cash accounts may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit. At December 31, 2019, the Company had approximately $22.8 million in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had the following 10 percent or greater concentrations of revenue with its customers: At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had the following 10 percent or greater concentrations of accounts receivable with its customers: *Revenues from customer A are derived from a customer located in the United States. Revenues from customer B were derived from a customer located in Sweden which was acquired on October 25, 2019. Please refer to note 10, further details. All other revenues customers were mainly derived from the United States. **Receivables from customer A are obtained from a customer located in the United States. Receivables from customer B were derived from a customer located in Sweden which was acquired on October 25, 2019. Please refer to note 10, further details. Receivables from customer C pertained to a customer in China which now reflects the change in our China business model to a royalty and licensing framework. Cash Equivalents — The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company did not have any investments with maturities of three months or less. Accounts Receivable — Accounts receivable are reported at net realizable value. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors pertaining to the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends, and other information. Delinquent accounts are written-off when it is determined that the amounts are uncollectible. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, there was an allowance for doubtful accounts of $292,400 and $183,000, respectively. F- 9 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2019 and 2018 Inventories — Inventories include only the purchase cost and are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined using the FIFO method. Inventories consist of raw materials and finished products. The Company establishes an inventory reserve to reduce the value of the inventory during the period in which such materials and products are no longer usable or marketable. Specifically, the Company reviews inventory utilization during the past twelve months and also customer orders for subsequent months. If there has been no utilization during the last 12 months and there are no orders in-place in future months which will require the use of inventory item, then inventory item will be included as part of the reserve during the period being evaluated. Management will then specifically evaluate whether these items may be utilized within a reasonable time frame (e.g., 3 to 6 months). In 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded inventory reserves in the amount of $332,000 and $74,650, respectively. The increase in reserve is related to recording European inventories at fair market value. The inventory reserve is included in cost of revenue. Free Samples are recorded as cost of sales. Property and Equipment — Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation of property and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset generally ranging from three to seven years. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets — In accordance with ASC Topics 350 “Goodwill and Other Intangibles” and 360, “Property, Plant, and Equipment” the Company reviews the carrying value of intangibles and other long-lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of long-lived assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the undiscounted cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the property, if any, exceeds its fair value. Goodwill — The Company records goodwill when the consideration paid for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, including related tax effects. Goodwill is not amortized; instead goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if the Company believes indicators of impairment exist. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the Company determines that the fair value is less than the carrying value, the Company will use a two-step process to determine the amount of goodwill impairment. The first step requires comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its net book value, including goodwill. A potential impairment exists if the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its net book value. The second step of the process, performed only if a potential impairment exists, involves determining the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit’s net assets, other than goodwill, and the fair value of the reporting unit. An impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value. For the year ended December 31, 2019, there were no indicators for impairment. On October 25, 2019 the Company acquired 100% of Func Food Group Oyj (“Func Food”) their distributor in the Nordics. As a result of the acquisition goodwill of approximately $10,024,000 resulted from the excess of the consideration paid and the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets (see note 10). There was no other activity related to goodwill during the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018. F- 10 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2019 and 2018 Intangible assets – Intangible assets are comprised of customer relationships and brands acquired in a business combination. The Company amortizes intangible assets with a definitive life over their respective useful lives. Intangibles with indefinite lives are tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if the Company believes indicators of impairment exist. Revenue Recognition — The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers.” The Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied. Product sales occur once control is transferred upon delivery to the customer. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods. The amount of consideration the Company receives and revenue the Company recognizes varies with changes in customer incentives the Company offers to its customers and their customers. Sales taxes and other similar taxes are excluded from revenue. Customer Advances — From time to time the Company requires deposits in advance of delivery of products and/or production runs. Such amounts are initially recorded as customer advances liability within other current liabilities. The Company recognizes such revenue as it is earned in accordance with revenue recognition policies. As of December 31, 2019, and 2018, the Company did not have any customer advances. Advertising Costs — Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. The Company uses mainly radio, local sampling events, sponsorships, endorsements, and digital advertising. The Company incurred marketing and advertising expenses of approximately $7.9 million and $13.8 million, during years ending December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Research and Development — Research and development costs are charged to general and administrative expenses as incurred and consist primarily of consulting fees, raw material usage and test productions of beverages. The Company incurred expenses of $341,000 and $572,000 during years ending December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Foreign Currency Translation — Foreign subsidiaries’ functional currency is the local currency of operations and the net assets of foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates. The U.S. dollar results that arise from such translation, as well as exchange gains and losses on intercompany balances of long-term investment nature, are included in Comprehensive Income. The Company incurred foreign currency translation losses during the year ending in December 31, 2019 of approximately $60,500 and a gain of approximately $12,400 during the year ending December 31, 2018. Fair Value of Financial Instruments — The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and notes payable approximates fair value due to their relative short-term maturity and market interest rates. F- 11 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2019 and 2018 Fair Value Measurements - ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally, ASC 820 requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized below: Other than these noted previously, the Company did not have any other assets or liabilities measured at fair value at December 31, 2019 and 2018. Income Taxes — The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the provisions of ASC 740-10, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” which requires, among other things, an asset and liability approach to calculating deferred income taxes. The asset and liability approach require the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets for which management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred asset will not be realized. The Company follows the provisions of the ASC 740 -10 related to, Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Positions. When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10, the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. F- 12 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2019 and 2018 Income Taxes (continued) — Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. The Company believes its tax positions are all highly certain of being upheld upon examination. As such, the Company has not recorded a liability for uncertain tax benefits. The Company has adopted ASC 740-10-25 Definition of Settlement, which provides guidance on how an entity should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits and provides that a tax position can be effectively settled upon the completion of an examination by a taxing authority without being legally extinguished. For tax positions considered effectively settled, an entity would recognize the full amount of tax benefit, even if the tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained based solely on the basis of its technical merits and the statute of limitations remains open. The Company’s tax returns for tax years in 2016 through 2019 remain subject to potential examination by the taxing authorities. Earnings per Share — Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income (loss) available to stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share are computed using the weighted average number of common and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding during the period. Under ASC 260-10-45-16, the calculation of diluted earnings per share, the numerator should be adjusted to add back any convertible dividends and the after-tax amount of interest recognized in the period associated with any convertible debt. The denominator should include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued. The effects of dilutive instruments have been presented for the year-to-date net income as of December 31, 2019. Other periods presented do not reflect the dilutive shares, as the effects would be anti-dilutive due to the fact that losses are being reflected for those periods. Please refer to the below table for additional details: F- 13 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2019 and 2018 Share-Based Payments —The Company follows the provisions of ASC Topic 718 “Compensation — Stock Compensation” and related interpretations. As such, compensation cost is measured on the date of grant at the fair value of the share-based payments. Such compensation amounts, if any, are amortized over the respective vesting periods of the grants. On April 30, 2015, the Company adopted the 2015 Stock Incentive Plan. This plan is intended to provide incentives which will attract and retain highly competent persons at all levels as employees of the Company, as well as independent contractors providing consulting or advisory services to the Company, by providing them opportunities to acquire the Company’s common stock or to receive monetary payments based on the value of such shares pursuant to Awards issued. The 2015 Plan permits the grant of options and shares for up to 5,000,000 shares. In addition, there is a provision for an annual increase of 15% to the shares included under the plan, with the shares to be added on the first day of each calendar year, beginning on January 1, 2017 (note 19). Cost of Sales — Cost of sales consists of the cost of concentrates and or beverage bases, the costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of products, co-packing fees, repacking fees, in-bound & out-bound freight charges, as well as certain internal transfer costs, warehouse expenses incurred prior to the manufacture of the Company’s finished products and certain quality control costs. Raw materials account for the largest portion of the cost of sales. Raw materials include cans, bottles, other containers, flavors, ingredients and packaging materials. Operating Expenses — Operating expenses include selling expenses such as warehousing expenses after manufacture, as well as expenses for advertising, samplings and in-store demonstrations costs, costs for merchandise displays, point-of-sale materials and premium items, sponsorship expenses, other marketing expenses and design expenses. Operating expenses also include such costs as payroll costs, travel costs, professional service fees (including legal fees), depreciation and other general and administrative costs. Shipping and Handling Costs — Shipping and handling costs for freight-out expense on goods shipped are included in cost of sales expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Freight-out expense on goods shipped for years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $6.3 million and $5.5 million, respectively. Recent Accounting Pronouncements The Company adopts all applicable, new accounting pronouncements as of the specified effective dates. Leases — The Company adopted ASU No. 2016-02, as amended, effective January 1, 2019. The adoption of the standard will result in the recognition of right to use assets and lease liabilities that have not been previously recorded (note 7). In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, “Intangibles and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment”, which eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill, but rather requires an entity to record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying value over its fair value. This amendment is effective for annual or interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurements (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. The amendments in this update modify the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements in Topic 820. The ASU is effective for the Registrants for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this standard on their Financial Statements. F- 14 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2019 and 2018 Recent Accounting Pronouncements (continued) All new accounting pronouncements issued but not yet effective are not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position with the exception of the updated previously disclosed above, there have been no new accounting pronouncements not yet effective that have significance to our consolidated financial statements. Liquidity — These financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will be able to continue as a going concern. At December 31, 2019, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $63,409,431 which includes a net income available to common stockholders of $9,971,260 for year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ending December 31, 2019 the Company’s net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately $1,034,000 . On September 16, 2019 the Company issued 7,986,110 in a public placement and obtained gross proceeds of $28,749,996 and paid $1,585,000 in commissions & fees and incurred in $209,559 of expenses related to the capital raise thereby resulting in net-proceeds in the amount of $26,955,437. Management deems that there is sufficient liquidity to properly operate the business for the next 12 twelve months. Information about the Company’s net sales by reporting segment for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 is as follows: License Agreement In January 2019, the Company entered into a license and repayment of investment agreement with Qifeng Food Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd (“Qifeng”). Under the agreement, Qifeng was granted the exclusive license rights to manufacture, market and commercialize Celsius branded products in China. The term of the agreement is 50 years, with annual royalty fees due from Qifeng after the end of each calendar year. The royalty fees are based on a percentage of Qifeng’s sales of Celsius branded products; however, the fees are fixed for the first five years of the agreement, totaling approximately $6.9 million, and then are subject to annual guaranteed minimums over the remaining term of the agreement. Under the agreement, the Company grants Qifeng exclusive license rights and provides ongoing support in product development, brand promotion and technical expertise. The ongoing support is integral to the exclusive license rights and, as such, both of these represent a combined, single performance obligation. The transaction price consists of the guaranteed minimums and the variable royalty fees, all of which are allocated to the single performance obligation. The Company recognizes revenue from the agreement over time because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits from the services. The Company uses the passage of time to measure progress towards satisfying its performance obligation because its efforts in providing the exclusive license rights and ongoing support occur on a generally even basis throughout the year. Total revenue recognized under the agreement was approximately $346,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 which is included as part of other current assets and is reflected in the Company’s Asia reporting segment which was determined by the minimum royalties due during first year, as per the licensing agreement. Inventories consist of the following at: F- 15 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2019 and 2018 Prepaid expenses and other current assets total $4,170,000 and $2,300,000, at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and consist mainly of prepaid advances to co-packers related to inventory production, advertising, prepaid insurance, prepaid slotting fees, value added tax payments and deposits on purchases. Note receivable consists of the following at: On January 1, 2019, the Company entered into a license and repayment of investment agreement with Qifeng Food Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd (“Qifeng”). Under the agreement, Qifeng will repay the market investment Celsius has made into China to date, over a five-year period, under an unsecured, interest-bearing note receivable (“Note”). The initial outstanding principal under the Note was approximately $12.2 million which is denominated in Chinese Renminbi (CNY) and was recorded as Other Income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2019. The amount recognized considered the net of the balances of the accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, as well as the marketing investments that were performed in the China market. Scheduled principal payments plus accrued interest are due annually on March 31 of each year starting in 2020. The Note is recorded at amortized cost basis and accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to the weighted average of 5% of the outstanding principal up to $5 million and 2% of the outstanding principal above $5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the weighted average interest rate was 3.21% and interest income was approximately $382,000. The Company assesses the Note for impairment periodically by evaluating whether it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all the contractual interest and principal payments as scheduled in the Note agreement, based on historical experience about Qifeng’s ability to pay, the current economic environment and other factors. If the Note is determined to be impaired, the impairment is measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flows under the Note, discounted at the Note’s effective interest rate. At December 31, 2019, the Note was not deemed to be impaired. The first installment of the note in the amount of RMB 13,253,093 is due on March 31, 2020. We were requested to provide a 3-month consideration to delay payment until June 30, 2019, due to the impact of the health crisis in China. For this consideration, a guarantee was obtained for the full amount of the first-installment and offers as collateral stock certificates in Celsius Holdings, Inc., which amount to 570,412 shares. The consideration was provided and therefore payment in full of the first installment is expected to be provided on June 30, 2020. F- 16 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2019 and 2018 In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02 (ASU 2016-02), Leases (Topic 842). Topic 842 requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use (ROU) asset and lease liability in the balance sheet for all leases, including operating leases with terms of more than twelve months. The Company adopted Topic 842, as amended, effective January 1, 2019. Upon adopting Topic 842, the Company recognized a ROU asset of $259,358 and a corresponding lease liability pertaining to the Company’s operating lease of its corporate office space from a related party (see Note 20), measured based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments utilizing the Company’s incremental borrowing rate as the basis for the computations. ROU assets also include any lease payments made and exclude lease incentives. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. The adoption of Topic 842 did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations or consolidated statements of cash flows, and did not result in a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings in the period of adoption. The Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the Topic 842, which allowed the Company to carry forward the historical lease classification, not reassess prior conclusions related to expired or existing contracts that are or that contain leases, and not reassess the accounting for initial direct costs. In addition to the Company’s operating lease of its corporate office space, the Company acquired certain other leases of vehicles and office space as part of its Acquisition of Func Food during the fourth quarter of 2019 (see Note 10). At the inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. The Company’s assessment is based on: (1) whether the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (2) whether the Company obtains the right to substantially all the economic benefit from the use of the asset throughout the term, and (3) whether the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. At inception of a lease, the Company allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease and non-lease component based on the component’s relative stand-alone price to determine the lease payments. Lease and non-lease components are accounted for separately. Leases are classified as either finance leases or operating leases based on criteria in Topic 842. The Company’s operating leases are generally comprised of real estate and vehicles, and the Company’s finance leases are generally comprised of vehicles. Lease expense for operating leases, consisting of lease payments, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Included in lease expense are any variable lease payments incurred in the period that were not included in the initial lease liability. Lease expense for finance leases consists of the amortization of the ROU asset on a straight-line basis over the asset’s estimated useful life and interest expense is calculated using the effective interest rate method. F- 17 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2019 and 2018 The following is a summary of lease cost recognized in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019: The following is a summary of the impact of the Company’s leases on the consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019: The following is a summary of the weighted average remaining lease term and weighted average discount rate for the Company’s population of leases as of December 31, 2019: The future annual minimum lease payments required under the Company’s leases as of December 31, 2019 are as follows: F- 18 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2019 and 2018 Property and equipment consist of the following at: Depreciation expense amounted to $66,939 and $51,205 during year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Goodwill consists of approximately $10,023,806 resulting from the excess of the consideration paid and the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired from the Func Food Acquisition (see note 10). There was no other activity related to goodwill during the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018. Intangible assets consist of acquired customer relationships and brands from the Func Food Acquisition, amounting to approximately $14,050,000 and $3,123,000, respectively. Customer relationships are amortized over an estimated useful life of 25 years and brands have an indefinite life. The following is the future estimated amortization expense related to customer relationships as of December 31, 2019: F- 19 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2019 and 2018 The Company acquired 100% of Func Food Group, Oyj (“Func Food) on October 25, 2019 (“the Acquisition”). The Acquisition was structured as a purchase of all of Func Food’s equity shares and a restructuring of Func Food’s pre-existing debt. Total consideration was $27,060,701, which consisted of approximately $14,188,000 in cash, $8,357,000 of newly issued bonds (see Note 14) and $4,516,000 related to the settlement of a pre-existing debt. In addition to the aforementioned bond issuance, the Company financed the acquisition by issuing new common shares. Func Food is a marketer and distributor of nutritional supplements, health food products and beverages, that support sport activities and healthy living and lifestyles in Finland, Sweden, and Norway. Func Food has been the Nordic distributor of Celsius products since 2015 and, as a result of the acquisition, the Company expects to further increase its Nordic market share by leveraging collaborations, revamping its marketing strategy and focusing on core products. It also expects to reduce costs through economies of scale. The Company recorded the acquisition in accordance with ASC-805, pertaining to business combinations. The following table summarizes the consideration paid for Func Food and the amounts of the assets acquired at fair market value and liabilities assumed recognized at the Acquisition date. F- 20 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2019 and 2018 The following pro-forma consolidated results of operations have been presented as if the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2018 For the year ended December 31, 2019, pro forma earnings include approximately $6.7 million of historical, non-recurring charges of Func Food that are not expected to have an ongoing effect after the Acquisition. These non-recurring charges consist of $2.2 million of inventory impairment charges, $0.3 million of restructuring charges, and $4.2 million of incremental interest expense on Func Food’s historical debt that was restructured as part of the Acquisition. Consequently, 2019 earnings would have amounted to $8.5 million had these non-recurring expenses not been incurred. For the year ended December 31, 2018, pro forma earnings includes approximately $15.3 million of historical, non-recurring charges of Func Food that are not expected to have an ongoing effect after the Acquisition. These non-recurring charges consist of $1.6 million of inventory impairment charges, $0.4 million of restructuring charges, $9.1 million of intangible asset and goodwill impairment, and $4.2 million of incremental interest expense on Func Food’s historical debt that was restructured as part of the acquisition. The year ended December 31, 2018 would have reflected a loss of $19.1million had these non-recurring expenses not been incurred. Accounts payable and accrued expenses consist of the following at: F- 21 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2019 and 2018 Other current liabilities consist of the following at: Line of credit convertible note payable - related party consists of the following as of: F- 22 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2019 and 2018 F- 23 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2019 and 2018 Bonds payable consists of the following as of: Bonds issued as part of the purchase consideration to acquire Func Food (see note 9). The Bonds are Euro-denominated, unregistered, and were issued on October 25, 2019 at an initial nominal amount of approximately $9.1 million, less discount and issuance costs of approximately $0.7 million. The Bonds accrue interest at a stated interest rate of 6.00% per annum, due semi-annually in arrears, with the first interest payment due on April 30, 2020. The maturity date of the Bonds is October 30, 2020. The Bonds are carried at the nominal amount, less any unamortized discount and issuance costs. The discount is amortized using the effective interest rate method. As of December 31, 2019, the unamortized balance of the discount is approximately $377,000. Amortization of the discount was approximately $78,250 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The bond issuance costs amounted to $229,250. The issuance costs are being amortized over a straight-line basis, given the short-term nature and that it does not result in a material difference from applying the effective interest rate method. Amortization of the bond issuance costs from the issuance date through December 31, 2019 was $40,938. Upon maturity of the Bonds, the Company may, at its own election, convert up to 50% of the outstanding nominal amount of the Bonds into shares of common stock of the Company, at a conversion price relative to the 30-day weighted-average trading price of the Company’s common shares prior to the Acquisition. At the Company’s election, the Bonds are callable at 103% at any time. Additionally, mandatory prepayments would be required in the event of either i) a capital raise consummated by the Company or ii) the sale of a certain product line of Func Food. To the fullest extent possible, the net proceeds derived from either event must first be applied towards prepayment of the bonds at 103%, plus any accrued but unpaid interest on the repaid amount. The Bonds are unsubordinated and are guaranteed by Func Food and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. The Bonds are secured by substantially all the assets of Func Food. The Bonds contain certain financial covenants that are specific to Func Food, mainly related to minimum cash requirements at the end of each quarter. As of December 31, 2019, Func Food is in compliance with these covenants. F- 24 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2019 and 2018 The Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with CDS Ventures of South Florida, LLC (“CDS”) and CD Financial, LLC (“CD”). CDS and CD are limited liability companies which are affiliates of Carl DeSantis, the Company’s principal shareholder. The Company issued 2,200 shares of its Series C Preferred Stock (the “Preferred C Shares”) in exchange for the conversion of a $550,000 short term loan from CDS and the conversion of $1,650,000 in indebtedness under the Company’s line of credit with CD (the “CD Line of Credit”). The Preferred C Shares are convertible into our common stock at the option of the holder thereof at a conversion price of $0.52 per share at any time until December 31, 2018, at which time they will automatically convert into shares of our common stock determined by dividing the liquidation preference of $1,000 per Preferred C Share by the conversion price then in effect. The conversion price is subject to adjustment in the event of stock dividends, stock splits and similar events. The Preferred C Shares accrue cumulative annual dividends at the rate of 6% per annum, payable by the issuance of additional Preferred C Shares. The holder of Preferred C Shares votes on an “as converted” basis, together with holders of common stock as a single class on all matters presented to shareholders for a vote, except as required by law. In April 2015, the Company issued 180 Preferred C Shares valued at $180,000 in settlement of $180,000 in accrued preferred C dividends. In October 2018, the Company issued 383 Preferred C Shares valued at $383,000 in settlement of $383,000 in accrued preferred C dividends. As of December 31, 2018, $255,903 of dividends has been accrued and converted into 256 of additional Preferred C. The Preferred C Shares matured on December 31, 2018 and were exchanged for shares of Company common stock in the amount of 5,806,022. On April 16, 2015, the Company entered into an amendment to its existing Loan and Security Agreement (the “Amendment”) with CD an affiliate of CDS Ventures and Mr. DeSantis. Pursuant to the Amendment, the outstanding principal amount of the CD note payable was reduced by $4.0 million, which amount was converted into 4,000 shares of a newly-designated Series D Preferred Stock (the “Preferred D Shares”). This related party was given a conversion price of $0.86 per common share, whereas other investors purchased common shares at $0.89 in the private placement, as discussed in note 12. The difference of $0.03 per share, which resulted in $139,535, was recorded as a dividend in accordance with ASC 470-20-35, subsequent measurement for debt with conversion and other options. The Preferred D Shares are convertible into our common stock at the option of the holder thereof at a conversion price of $0.86 per share until the earlier of the January 2, 2021 due date of our note payable with CD Financial or such earlier date as the note payable is satisfied (the “Maturity Date”). The conversion price is subject to adjustment in the event of stock dividends, stock splits and similar events. The Preferred D Shares accrue cumulative annual cash dividends at the rate of 5% per annum, payable quarterly in cash and have a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share. On the Maturity Date, the Preferred D Shares automatically convert into shares of our common stock in a number determined by dividing the $1,000 per Preferred D Share liquidation preference plus any accrued but unpaid dividends, by the conversion price then in effect. The Holder shall have the right, at its election, to require the Company to redeem all or any portion of the shares held by the holder in exchange for cash or common stock upon the occurrence of certain events which management believes are under the control of the Company. As of March 31, 2018, none of the contingent events have occurred and in accordance with ASC-480-10-25 “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity” and Regulation S-X-Rule 5-02-27, the Company has classified these shares as permanent equity. The Preferred D Shares may also be redeemed by us at any time on or after December 31, 2017, at a redemption price equal to 104% of the liquidation preference. The holder of the Preferred D Shares votes on an “as converted” basis, together with holders of common stock as a single class on all matters presented to shareholders for a vote, except as required by law. In March 2018, the Preferred D shares were converted into 4,651,163 shares of common stock. F- 25 Celsius Holdings, Inc.

Conversion of Notes Payable into common stock On September 16, 2019, the company had three Notes Payable outstanding with related parties for a total principal value of $10 million. As per the terms of the agreements, the principal values of notes payable and any accrued but unpaid interest are convertible into common stock of the Company. Moreover, also as per the terms of the agreements, in the event of financing greater than $25.0 million, the principal value of the notes and any accrued but unpaid interest are automatically converted into the company’s common stock. As result of the public financing which raised $26,955,437, the principal balance of the notes payable and the accrued but unpaid interest of $10,233,332 were converted resulting in the issuance of 3,196,460, shares of common stock. The shares were issued at the contractual conversion prices per the loan agreements. Refer to Note 13 for discussion on the conversion of the notes payable. F- 26 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2019 and 2018 Due to recurring losses for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company’s net tax provision was zero. The difference between the effective income tax rate and the applicable statutory federal income tax rate is summarized as follows: At December 31, 2019 and 2019, the Company’s deferred tax assets were as follows: The Company’s valuation allowance increased by $1,184,000 and $2,012,000 during 2019 and 2018 respectively. Total net operating loss carry forwards at December 31, 2019 were approximately $33.1 million, of which approximately $31.9 million, will expire between 2029 and 2037 and $1.2 million may be carried forward indefinitely. China has corporate tax rate of 25% with net operating loss carry forwards expiring after 5 years. The Company had $14.7 million of net operating loss carry forwards in China as of December 31, 2019. Hong Kong has a corporate tax rate of 17% with net operating loss carry forwards that don’t expire. The Company had $2.8million of net operating loss carry forwards in Hong Kong as of December 31, 2019. On October 25, 2019, the Company acquired wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries in Finland, Sweden and Norway. These companies had net operating loss carryforwards of $11.2 million in Finland and $12.9 million in Sweden. There were no net operating loss carryforwards in Norway. The Finland tax rate is 33.6% and the Sweden tax rate is 21.4%. Due to the uncertainty regarding the Company’s ability to retain the tax benefits of these losses in Sweden, the Company has not included these net operating loss carryforwards as part of their deferred tax assets. The Company’s net operating loss carry forwards may be limited due to ownership changes. The Company adopted an Incentive Stock Plan on January 18, 2007. This plan is intended to provide incentives which will attract and retain highly competent persons at all levels as employees of the Company, as well as independent contractors providing consulting or advisory services to the Company, by providing them opportunities to acquire the Company’s common stock or to receive monetary payments based on the value of such shares pursuant to Awards issued. While the plan terminates 10 years after the adoption date, issued options have their own schedule of termination. During 2013, the majority of the shareholders approved to increase the total available shares in the plan from 2.5 million to 3.5 million shares of common stock. During May 2014, the majority of the shareholders approved to increase the total available shares in the plan from 3.5 million to 4.25 million shares of common stock, during February 2015, the majority of the shareholders approved to increase the total available shares in the plan from 4.25 million to 4.6 million shares of common stock and during April 2015, the majority of the shareholders approved to increase the total available shares in the plan from 4.6 million to 5.1 million shares of common stock. Options to acquire shares of common stock may be granted at no less than fair market value on the date of grant. Upon exercise, shares of new common stock are issued by the Company. F- 27 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2019 and 2018 The Company adopted the 2015 Stock Incentive Plan on April 30, 2015. This plan is intended to provide incentives which will attract and retain highly competent persons at all levels as employees of the Company, as well as independent contractors providing consulting or advisory services to the Company, by providing them opportunities to acquire the Company’s common stock or to receive monetary payments based on the value of such shares pursuant to Awards issued. The 2015 Plan permits the grant of options and shares for up to 5,000,000 shares. In addition, there is a provision for an annual increase of 15% of the shares pertaining to the 2015 plan that are outstanding as of the last day of the prior year. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 400,000 shares are available. Under the 2015 Stock Incentive Plan, the Company has issued options to purchase approximately 6.53 million shares at an average price of $3.58 with a fair value of $5.10 million. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company issued options to purchase 1.20 million and 1.83 million shares. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company recognized an expense of approximately $4.8 million and $4.3 million, respectively, of non-cash compensation expense (included in General and Administrative expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations) determined by application of a Black Scholes option pricing model with the following inputs: exercise price, dividend yields, risk-free interest rate, and expected annual volatility. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had approximately $8,531,047 of unrecognized pre-tax non-cash compensation expense, which the Company expects to recognize, based on a weighted-average period of 3 years. The Company used straight-line amortization of compensation expense over the two to three-year requisite service or vesting period of the grant. There are options to purchase approximately 2.35 million shares that have vested as of December 31, 2019. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of its stock option awards and warrant issuances. The calculation of the fair value of the awards using the Black - Scholes option-pricing model is affected by the Company’s stock price on the date of grant as well as assumptions regarding the following: 4.02-5.00 Years F- 28 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2019 and 2018 The expected volatility was determined with reference to the historical volatility of the Company’s stock. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination within the valuation model. The expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury rate in effect at the time of grant. A summary of the status of the Company’s outstanding stock options as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 and changes during the periods ending on that date is as follows: The following table summarizes information about employee stock options outstanding at December 31, 2019: F- 29 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2019 and 2018 As previously reported, on December 18, 2018, Rockstar, Inc. (“Rockstar”) filed suit against Celsius in federal district court in the District of Nevada. Rockstar’s complaint alleged three claims for relief: (a) false advertising in violation of 15 USC §1125(a); (b) violation of the Nevada Deceptive Trade Practice Act; and (c) Nevada common law unfair competition. On January 16, 2020 the parties entered into a non-monetary settlement of this litigation. On April 8, 2019, Daniel Prescod filed suit against Celsius in the Superior Court for the State of California, County of Los Angeles (the “Prescod Litigation”). Daniel Prescod asserts that the Company’s use of citric acid in its products while simultaneously claiming “no preservatives” violates California Consumer Legal Remedies Act, California Business and Professions Code Section 17200, et seq., and California Business and Professions Code Section 17500, et seq., because citric acid acts as a preservative. The Company does not use citric acid as a preservative in its products, but rather as a flavoring, and therefore it believes that its “no preservatives” claim is fair and not deceptive. The Company intends to contest the claims vigorously. Since this matter is still in its initial stages, the Company is unable to predict the outcome at this time. On January 24, 2020, Evlution Nutrition, LLC filed suit against Celsius in federal court for the Southern District of Florida, for trademark infringement (the “Evlution Litigation”). Evlution asserts that Celsius’ BCAA dietary supplement product’s use of BCAA + ENERGY infringes upon Evlution’s registered trademarks. The Company believes that Evlution’s trademarks are invalid, merely descriptive, and unenforceable and Celsius has filed a cancellation proceeding regarding those trademarks with the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board of the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The Company intends to defend against Evlution’s claims vigorously. Since this matter is still in its initial stages, the Company is unable to predict the outcome at this time. In addition to the foregoing, from time to time, we may become party to litigation or other legal proceedings that we consider to be a part of the ordinary course of our business. The Company has entered into distribution agreements with liquidated damages in case the Company cancels the distribution agreements without cause. Cause has been defined in various ways. It is management’s belief that no such agreement has created any liability as of December 31, 2019. In February 2020, the Company’s board of directors and majority shareholders authorized an increase in the number of shares of common stock which the Company is authorized to issue from 75 million shares to 100 million shares. Implementation of the increase is subject to compliance with SEC requirements. The first installment of the note receivable from Qifeng Food Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd (Note 6) in the amount of RMB 13,253,093 was due on March 31, 2020. We were recently requested by Qifeng to provide a three-month extension of the due date for the first installment until June 30, 2019, due to the impact of the health crisis in China. In consideration of the extension, a guarantee was obtained for the full amount of the first-installment and the installment was collateralized by a pledge of 570,412 of our common shares held. Accordingly, Celsius granted the extension and as a result, payment in full of the first installment is expected to be paid on or before June 30, 2020. Between January 1, 2020 and March 12, 2020, the Company issued an aggregate of 297,949 shares of its common stock pursuant to the exercise of stock options granted under the Company’s 2015 Stock Incentive Plan.

Business Overview We are engaged in the development, marketing, sale and distribution of functional calorie-burning fitness and lifestyle beverages under the Celsius® brand name. According to multiple clinical studies we funded, a single serving of Celsius® burns 100 to 140 calories by increasing a consumer’s resting metabolism an average of 12% and providing sustained energy for up to a nine-hour period. Our exercise focused studies show Celsius delivers additional benefits when consumed prior to exercise. The studies show benefits such as increase in fat burn, increase in lean muscle mass and increased endurance. We seek to combine nutritional science with mainstream beverages by using our proprietary thermogenic (calorie-burning) MetaPlus® formulation, while fostering the goal of healthier everyday refreshment by being as natural as possible without the artificial preservatives often found in many energy drinks and sodas. Celsius® has no artificial preservatives, aspartame or high fructose corn syrup and is very low in sodium. Celsius® uses good-for-you ingredients and supplements such as green tea (EGCG), ginger, calcium, chromium, B vitamins and vitamin C. The main Celsius line of products are sweetened with sucralose, a sugar-derived sweetener that is found in Splenda®, which makes our beverages low-calorie and suitable for consumers whose sugar intake is restricted. We currently offer five beverage lines, CELSIUS® Originals, CELSIUS HEAT™, CELSIUS® BCAA+ENERGY, CELSIUS® On-the-Go and CELSIUS® Sweetened with Stevia. Celsius has undertaken significant marketing efforts aimed at building brand awareness, including a wide variety of marketing vehicles such as television, radio, digital, social media, sponsorships, and magazine advertising. We also undertake various promotions at the retail level such as coupons and other discounts in addition to in-store sampling. During the first quarter of 2021, Celsius launched a branded cooler program, with a first phase target of locating up to 1,000 coolers in various retail outlets. We distribute our In the United States and elsewhere in North America, Celsius ® is sold across many retail segments. They include supermarkets, convenience stores, drug stores, nutritional stores, and mass merchants. We also sell to health clubs, spas, gyms, the military and e-commerce websites. We distribute our products domestically through a hybrid of direct-store delivery (DSD) distributors and as well as sales direct to retailers (DTR). We are continuing to emphasize DSD distribution as we believe it has been a key element in opening additional domestic markets and retail segments and increasing sales. Our products are distributed in various foreign regions, primarily Europe and Asia, through regional and country-specific distribution partners. In October 2019, we acquired Func Food, our Nordic distribution partner, who markets both our products as well as other products under its own brands. Celsius intends to use Func Food as a platform to expand product distribution elsewhere in Europe. The Company does not directly manufacture its beverages and powder packets, but instead outsource the manufacturing process to established third-party co-packers. We do, however, provide our co-packers with flavors, ingredient blends, cans and other raw materials for our beverages purchased by us from various suppliers. Recent Developments On October 30, 2020, the Company fully repaid the outstanding bonds payable, which were reinstated as part of the acquisition of Func Food on October 25, 2019, in accordance with the original terms of the bonds. The total amount repaid was approximately $9.9 million, which included principal of $9.6 million and accrued interest of $0.3 million. Potential Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Company’s Business Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in the global macro-economic environment which may also reflect the negative impacts caused by pandemic and public health crises related to the COVID-19 pandemic. These macro-economic aspects may also impact inflation, currency exchange rates, interest rates, availability of capital markets, consumer demand, distribution and raw material costs. Volatility in the financial markets and deterioration of global economic conditions could impact our business and operations in several ways, including the following: Our ability to commercialize our products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our supply chain, including third-party manufacturing or transportation and distribution capabilities, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related aspects or other reasons beyond our control or the control of our suppliers and business partners, could impair our operations. We are closely monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and its potential impact on our supply chain, distribution and our consolidated results of operations. While the beverage industry has experienced some shortages of cans as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Celsius has been able to secure adequate supply and has not experienced significant adverse effects on its business, operations and financial condition from such shortage or otherwise from the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, we are unable to accurately predict the impact that COVID-19 will have due to the uncertainties which include the ultimate geographic spread of the virus, the intensity of the virus, the duration of the outbreak, and/or actions that may be taken by governmental agencies. Corporate History We were incorporated in Nevada on April 26, 2005 under the name “Vector Ventures, Inc.” and originally engaged in mineral exploration. Such business was unsuccessful. On January 26, 2007, we acquired the Celsius ® beverage business of Elite FX, Inc., a Florida corporation engaged in the development of “functional” beverages since 2004 in a reverse merger, and subsequently changed our name to Celsius Holdings, Inc. Our Products Celsius ® calorie-burning beverages were first introduced to the marketplace in 2005. According to multiple clinical studies we funded, a single serving (12 ounce can) of Celsius ® burns 100 to 140 calories by increasing a consumer’s metabolism an average of 12% for up to a three-hour period. In addition, these studies have indicated that drinking a single serving of Celsius ® prior to exercising may improve cardiovascular health and fitness and enhance the loss of fat and gain of muscle from exercise. We seek to combine nutritional science with mainstream beverages by using our proprietary thermogenic (calorie-burning) MetaPlus ® formulation, while fostering the goal of healthier everyday refreshment by being as natural as possible without the artificial preservatives often found in many energy drinks or sodas. Celsius ® has no chemical preservatives, aspartame or high fructose corn syrup and is very low in sodium. Celsius ® uses good-for-you ingredients and supplements such as green tea (EGCG), ginger, calcium, chromium, B vitamins and vitamin C. Celsius is sweetened with sucralose, a sugar-derived sweetener that is found in Splenda ® , which makes our beverages low-calorie and suitable for consumers whose sugar intake is restricted. Each 12 ounce can of Celsius ® contains 200 milligrams of caffeine which is comparable to one 12-ounce cup of coffee from the leading coffeehouse. We currently five beverage lines: Celsius® ready-to drink products are packaged in a distinctive 12 ounce sleek can that uses vivid colors in abstract patterns to create a strong on-shelf impact. The cans are sold as singles or in four-packs. We have recently redesigned our packaging to provide a cleaner, crisper and more modern look. In addition to being sugar free, our original ready-to -drink products line is non-GMO, kosher and vegan certified and soy and gluten free. As a result of completion of the acquisition of Func Food in October 2019, we acquired the beverages, protein bars, supplements and superfoods marketed and distributed in Finland, Sweden, and Norway. These products are distributed under the FAST, FitFarm and CocoVi brands and which are owned by Func Food. FAST products is a market leader in Finland and has begun distribution into the Swedish market. FitFarm and CocoVi are well-established brands of superfoods and other supplements in the Nordic countries. Clinical Studies It is our belief that clinical studies substantiating product claims will become more important as more and more beverages are marketed with health claims. Celsius ® was one of the first functional beverages to be launched along with a clinical study. Celsius ® is also one of very few functional beverages that has clinical research on the actual product itself. Some beverage companies that do mention studies backing their claims are referencing independent studies conducted on one or more of the ingredients in the product. We believe that it is important and will become more important to have studies on the actual product. We have funded seven U.S. based clinical studies for Celsius ® . Each was conducted by a research organization and each studied the total Celsius ® formula. The first study was conducted by the Ohio Research Group of Exercise Science & Sports Nutrition. The remaining studies were conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of the University of Oklahoma. We funded all of the studies and provided Celsius® beverage for the studies. However, none of our directors, executive officers or principal shareholders is in any way affiliated with either of the two research organizations which conducted the studies. The first study was conducted in 2005 by the Ohio Research Group of Exercise Science & Sports Nutrition www.ohioresearchgroup.com. The Ohio Research Group of Exercise Science & Sports Nutrition is a multidisciplinary clinical research team dedicated to exploring the relationship between exercise, nutrition, dietary supplements and health. This placebo-controlled, double-blind cross-over study compared the effects of Celsius ® and the placebo on metabolic rate. Twenty-two participants were randomly assigned to ingest a 12 ounce serving of Celsius ® and on a separate day a serving of twelve ounces of Diet Coke ® . All subjects completed both trials using a randomized, counterbalanced design. Randomized means that subjects were selected for each group randomly to ensure that the different treatments were statistically equivalent. Counterbalancing means that individuals in one group drank the placebo on the first day and drank Celsius ® on the second day. The other group did the opposite. Counterbalancing is a design method that is used to control “order effects.” In other words, this was done to make sure that the order that subjects were served does not impact the results and analysis. Metabolic rate (via indirect calorimetry, measurements taken from breaths into and out of calorimeter) and substrate oxidation (via respiratory exchange ratios) were measured at baseline (pre-ingestion) and for ten minutes at the end of each hour for three hours post-ingestion. The results showed an average increase of metabolism of twelve percent over the three-hour period, compared to a statistically insignificant change for the control group. Metabolic rate, or metabolism, is the rate at which the body expends energy. This is also referred to as the “caloric burn rate.” Indirect calorimetry calculates heat that living organisms produce from their production of carbon dioxide. It is called “indirect” because the caloric burn rate is calculated from a measurement of oxygen uptake. Direct calorimetry would involve the subject being placed inside the calorimeter for the measurement to determine the heat being produced. Respiratory Exchange Ratio is the ratio oxygen taken in a breath compared to the carbon dioxide breathed out in one breath or exchange. Measuring this ratio can be used for estimating which substrate (fuel such as carbohydrate or fat) is being metabolized or ‘oxidized’ to supply the body with energy. The second study was conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2007. This blinded, placebo-controlled study was conducted on a total of 60 men and women of normal weight. An equal number of participants were separated into two groups to compare one serving (a single 12 ounce can) of Celsius ® to a placebo of the same amount. According to the study, those subjects consuming Celsius ® burned significantly more calories versus those consuming the placebo, over a three-hour period. The study confirmed that over the three-hour period, subjects consuming a single serving of Celsius ® burned 65% more calories than those consuming the placebo beverage and burned an average of more than 100 to 140 calories compared to the placebo. These results were statistically significant. The third study, conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2007, extended our second study with the same group of 60 individuals and protocol for 28 days and showed the same statistical significance of increased calorie burn (minimal attenuation). While the University of Oklahoma study did extend for 28 days, more testing would be needed for long term analysis of the Celsius ® calorie-burning effects. Also, although these studies were on relatively small numbers of subjects, they have statistically significant results. Additional studies on a larger number and wider range of body compositions can be considered to further the analysis. Our fourth study, conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2009, combined Celsius ® use with exercise. This ten-week placebo-controlled, randomized and blinded study was conducted on a total of 37 subjects. Participants were randomly assigned into one of two groups: Group 1 consumed one serving of Celsius ® per day, and Group 2 consumed one serving of an identically flavored and labeled placebo beverage. Both groups participated in ten weeks of combined aerobic and weight training, following the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines of training for previously sedentary adults. The results showed that consuming a single serving of Celsius ® prior to exercising may enhance the positive adaptations of exercise on body composition, cardio-respiratory fitness and endurance performance. According to the preliminary findings, subjects consuming a single serving of Celsius ® lost significantly more fat mass and gained significantly more muscle mass than those subjects consuming the placebo — a 93.75% greater loss in fat and 50% greater gain in muscle mass, respectively. The study also confirmed that subjects consuming Celsius® significantly improved measures of cardio-respiratory fitness and the ability to delay the onset of fatigue when exercising to exhaustion. Our fifth study was conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2009. This ten-week placebo-controlled, randomized and blinded study was conducted on a total of 27 previously sedentary overweight and obese female subjects. Participants were randomly assigned into groups that consumed identically tasting treatment beverages with exercise or without exercise. All participants consumed one drink, either placebo or Celsius ® , per day for 10 weeks. The exercise groups participated in ten weeks of combined aerobic and weight training, following the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines of training for previously sedentary adults. No changes were made to their diet. The results showed that consuming a single serving of Celsius ® prior to exercising may improve cardiovascular health and fitness and enhance the positive adaptations of exercise on body composition. According to the preliminary findings, subjects consuming a single serving of Celsius ® lost significantly more fat mass and gained significantly more muscle mass when compared to exercise alone — a 46% greater loss in fat, 27% greater gain in muscle mass, respectively. The study also confirmed that subjects consuming Celsius ® significantly improved measures of cardio-respiratory fitness — 35% greater endurance performance with significant improvements to lipid profiles — total cholesterol decreases of 5 to 13% and bad LDL cholesterol 12 to 18%. Exercise alone had no effect on blood lipid levels. Our sixth study was conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2009. This ten-week placebo-controlled, randomized and blinded study was conducted on a total of 37 previously sedentary male subjects. Participants were randomly assigned into groups that consumed identically tasting treatment beverages with exercise or without exercise. All participants consumed one drink, either placebo or Celsius ® , per day for 10 weeks. The exercise groups participated in ten weeks of combined aerobic and weight training, following the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines of training for previously sedentary adults. No changes were made to their diet. The results showed that consuming a single serving of Celsius ® prior to exercising may improve cardiovascular health and fitness and enhance the positive adaptations of exercise on body composition. Significantly greater decreases in fat mass and percentage body fat and increases in VO 2 were observed in the subjects that consumed Celsius ® before exercise versus those that consumed the placebo before exercise. Mood was not affected. Clinical markers for hepatic, renal, cardiovascular and immune function, as determined by pre-and post-blood work revealed no adverse effects. Our seventh study was conducted by Miami Research Institute in 2010 and demonstrated the efficacy and safety of the powders and the shots. This study allows the Company to make the same structure/function claims as the ready to drink beverages. Manufacture and Supply of Our Products Our beverages are produced by established third party beverage co-packers. A co-packer is a manufacturing plant that provides the service of filling bottles or cans for the brand owner. We believe one benefit of using co-packers is that we do not have to invest in the production facility and can focus our resources on brand development, sales and marketing. It also allows us produce in multiple locations strategically placed throughout the country. We purchase most of the ingredients and all packaging materials. The co-pack facility assembles our products and charges us a fee by the case. The shelf life of Celsius ® products is specified as 15 to 18 months. Substantially all of the raw materials used in the preparation, bottling and packaging of our products are purchased by us or by our co-packers in accordance with our specifications. Generally, we obtain the ingredients used in our products from domestic suppliers and some ingredients have several reliable suppliers. The ingredients in Celsius ® include green tea (EGCG), ginger (from the root), caffeine, B vitamins, vitamin C, taurine, guarana, chromium, calcium, glucuronolactone, sucralose, natural flavors and natural colorings. Celsius ® is labeled with a supplements facts panel. We have no major supply contracts with any of our suppliers. We single-source all our ingredients for purchasing efficiency; however, we have identified a second source for our critical ingredients and there are many suppliers of flavors, colorings and sucralose. In case of a supply restriction or interruption from any of the flavor and coloring suppliers, we would have to test and qualify other suppliers that may disrupt our production schedules. Packaging materials, except for our distinctive sleek aluminum cans, are easily available from multiple sources in the United States; however, due to efficiencies we utilize single source vendor relationships. While the beverage industry has experienced some shortages of cans as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Celsius has been able to secure adequate supply and has not experienced significant adverse effects from such shortages. We believe that our co-packing arrangement and supply sources are adequate for our present needs. Func Food similarly has its FAST and other products manufactured by independent third parties in the Nordic countries. Distribution Domestic In the United States and elsewhere in North America, Celsius® is sold across many retail segments. They include supermarkets, convenience stores, drug stores, nutritional stores, and mass merchants. We also sell to health clubs, spas, gyms, the military, and e-commerce websites. We distribute our products domestically through a hybrid of direct-store delivery (DSD) distributors and as well as sales direct to retailers (DTR). We are continuing to emphasize the expansion of our DSD distribution network as we believe it has been a key element in opening additional domestic markets and retail segments and increasing sales. We also sell our products online through our own and other e-commerce platforms such as Amazon. As a result of the shift to online purchasing by consumers, including additional growth arising from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of the shutdown of various retail outlets, particularly gyms and health clubs in the fitness channel, e-commerce sales have accounted for a growing percentage of our domestic revenue. We expect this trend to continue at least through most of 2021. International We distribute our products in various foreign regions through regional and country-specific distribution partners. In October 2019, we acquired Func Food, our Nordic distribution partner, who markets both our products as well as other products under its own brands. Celsius intends to use Func Food as a platform to expand product distribution elsewhere in Europe. We market our products in the Asian market, which is one of the most dynamic and fastest-growing, through a partnership with A.S. Watson industries in Hong Kong and a license agreement with our partner in China, Qifeng Food Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd. (“ Qifeng ”). While we initially began both local production and preliminary distribution of the Celsius® brand in 2018 through our partnership in Qifeng, effective January 1, 2019, we restructured our China distribution efforts by entering into two separate agreements as it relates to the commercialization of our Celsius products (i.e., license agreement) and a repayment of investment agreement with Qifeng. Under the license agreement, Qifeng was granted the exclusive license rights to manufacture, market and commercialize Celsius® brand products in China. Qifeng will pay a minimum royalty fee of $6.9 million for the five years of the term of the agreement, transitioning to a volume-based royalty fee, thereafter. Under a separate economic agreement, Qifeng Food will repay the marketing investments made by Celsius into the China market through 2018, over the same five-year period. The repayment, which was formalized via a note receivable from Qifeng, will need to be serviced even if the licensing agreement is cancelled or terminated. Significant Customer As a result of the growth of our business and the increase in online sales in 2020 related in part to the COVID-19 pandemic, one customer, Amazon, accounted for approximately 15% and 12.0% of our revenues during the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we do not believe that we are dependent on our sales to Amazon for our continued growth and profitability. Seasonality of Sales As is typical in the beverage industry, sales of our beverages are seasonal, with the highest sales volumes generally occurring in the second and third fiscal quarters, which correspond to the warmer months of the year in our major markets. Competition We believe that our Celsius® brand products are one of the few calorie-burning fitness beverages whose effectiveness is supported by clinical studies, which gives us a unique position in the beverage market. However, our products do compete broadly with all categories of consumer beverages. The beverage market is highly competitive, and includes international, national, regional and local producers and distributors, most of whom have greater financial, management and other resources than us. Our direct competitors in the functional beverage market include, but are not limited to The Coca-Cola Company, Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, PepsiCo, Inc., Nestlé, Waters North America, Inc., Hansen Natural Corp., Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Monster Energy, and Red Bull. Proprietary Rights We have registered the Celsius ® and MetaPlus ® trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, as well as a number of additional trademarks. We have and will continue to take appropriate measures, such as entering into confidentiality agreements with our contract packers and ingredient suppliers, to maintain the secrecy and proprietary nature of our MetaPlus ® formulation and product formulas. We maintain our MetaPlus ® formulation and product formulas as trade secrets. We believe that trade secrecy is a preferable method of protection for our formulas as patenting them might require their disclosure. Other than a company that is our outsourced production manager, no single member of the raw material supply chain or our co-packers has access to the complete formula. We consider our trademarks and trade secrets to be of considerable value and importance to our business. No successful challenges to our registered trademarks have arisen and we have no reason to believe that any such challenges will arise in the future. As a result of the acquisition of Func Food in October 2019, we have acquired additional brands and tradenames. Government Regulation The production, distribution and sale of our products in the United States is subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act , the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 , the Occupational Safety and Health Act , various environmental statutes and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products. California law requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a component listed by California as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects. The law exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products because the law recognizes no generally applicable quantitative thresholds below which a warning is not required. Consequently, even trace amounts of listed components can expose affected products to the prospect of warning labels. Products containing listed substances that occur naturally in the product or that are contributed to the product solely by a municipal water supply are generally exempt from the warning requirement. While none of our products are required to display warnings under this law, we cannot predict whether an important component of any of our products might be added to the California list in the future. We also are unable to predict whether or to what extent a warning under this law would have an impact on costs or sales of our products. Measures have been enacted in various localities and states that require that a deposit be charged for certain non-refillable beverage containers. The precise requirements imposed by these measures vary. Other deposit, recycling or product stewardship proposals have been introduced in certain states and localities and in Congress, and we anticipate that similar legislation or regulations may be proposed in the future at the local, state and federal levels, both in the United States and elsewhere. Our facilities in the United States are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Compliance with these provisions has not had, and we do not expect such compliance to have, any material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations. The marketing and sale of our products internationally is similarly subject to compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations in those foreign countries where our products are sold. Employees As of the date of this Report, the Company employs 154 people, including its executive officers. Item 1A. Risk Factors Our business faces certain risks. The risks described below may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently think as immaterial, may also impair our business. If any of the events anticipated by the risks described below or elsewhere in this report occur, our results of operations and financial conditions could be adversely affected. Risk Factors Relating to Our Business Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in the global macro-economic environment which may also reflect the negative impacts caused by pandemic and public health crises related to the COVID-19 pandemic. These macro-economic aspects may also impact inflation, currency exchange rates, interest rates, availability of capital markets, consumer demand, distribution and raw material costs. Volatility in the financial markets and deterioration of global economic conditions could impact our business and operations in several ways, including the following: Our ability to commercialize our products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our supply chain, including third-party manufacturing or transportation and distribution capabilities, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related aspects or other reasons beyond our control or the control of our suppliers and business partners, could impair our operations. We are closely monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and its potential impact on our supply chain, distribution and our consolidated results of operations. While the beverage industry has experienced some shortages of cans as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Celsius has been able to secure adequate supply and has not experienced significant adverse effects on its business, operations and financial condition from such shortage or otherwise from the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, we are unable to accurately predict the impact that COVID-19 will have due to the uncertainties which include the ultimate geographic spread of the virus, the intensity of the virus, the duration of the outbreak, and/or actions that may be taken by governmental agencies. We rely on third party co-packers to manufacture our products. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our co-packers and/or their ability to manufacture our products becomes constrained or unavailable to us, our business could suffer. We do not directly manufacture our products, but instead outsource such manufacturing to established third party co-packers. These third-party co-packers may not be able to fulfill our demand as it arises, could begin to charge rates that make using their services cost inefficient or may simply not be able to or willing to provide their services to us on a timely basis or at all. In the event of any disruption or delay, whether caused by a rift in our relationship or the inability of our co-packers to manufacture our products as required, we would need to secure the services of alternative co-packers. We may be unable to procure alternative packing facilities at commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time period and any such transition could be costly. In such case, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. We rely on distributors to distribute our products in the DSD sales channel and in international markets. If we are unable to secure such distributors and/or we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing distributors, our business could suffer. We distribute Celsius ® in the DSD sales channel by entering into agreements with direct-to-store delivery distributors having established sales, marketing and distribution organizations. We similarly are seeking to expand our international distribution, particularly in the Far East and elsewhere in Asia by entering into agreements with large established distributors who service those markets. Many of our distributors are affiliated with and manufacture and/or distribute other beverage products. In many cases, such products compete directly with our products. The marketing efforts of our distributors are important for our success. If Celsius ® proves to be less attractive to our distributors and/or if we fail to attract distributors, and/or our distributors do not market and promote our products with greater focus in preference to the products of our competitors, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Our customers are material to our success. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing customers, our business could suffer. Unilateral decisions could be taken by our distributors, grocery chains, convenience chains, drug stores, nutrition stores, mass merchants, club warehouses and other customers to discontinue carrying all or any of our products that they are carrying at any time, which could cause our business to suffer. Additionally, as a result of the growth of our business and the increase in online sales in 2020 related in part to the COVID-19 pandemic, one customer, Amazon, accounted for approximately 15% and 12.0% of our revenues during the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we do not believe that we are dependent on our sales to Amazon for our continued growth and profitability. Increases in cost or shortages of raw materials or increases in costs of co-packing could harm our business . The principal raw materials used by us are flavors and ingredient blends as well as aluminum cans, the prices of which are subject to fluctuations. We are uncertain whether the prices of any of the above or any other raw materials or ingredients we utilize will rise in the future and whether we will be able to pass any of such increases on to our customers. We do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials. In addition, some of these raw materials, such as our distinctive sleek 12 ounce can, are available from a single or a limited number of suppliers. As alternative sources of supply may not be available, any interruption in the supply of such raw materials might materially harm us. While the beverage industry has experienced some shortages of cans as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Celsius has been able to secure adequate supply and has not experienced significant adverse effects on its business, operations and financial condition from such shortage. However, there can be no assurance that if such shortages continue, its business, operations and financial condition will not be harmed. Our failure to accurately estimate demand for our products could adversely affect our business and financial results. We may not correctly estimate demand for our products. If we materially underestimate demand for our products and are unable to secure sufficient ingredients or raw materials, we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis, in which case our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We depend upon our trademarks and proprietary rights, and any failure to protect our intellectual property rights or any claims that we are infringing upon the rights of others may adversely affect our competitive position. Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to protect our current and future brands and products and to defend our intellectual property rights. We cannot be sure that trademarks will be issued with respect to any future trademark applications or that our competitors will not challenge, invalidate or circumvent any existing or future trademarks issued to, or licensed by, us. Our products are manufactured using our proprietary blends of ingredients. These blends are created by third-party suppliers to our specifications and then supplied to our co-packers. Although all of the third parties in our supply and manufacture chain execute confidentiality agreements, there can be no assurance that our trade secrets, including our proprietary ingredient blends will not become known to competitors. We believe that our competitors, many of whom are more established and have greater financial and personnel resources than we do, may be able to replicate or reverse engineer our processes, brands, flavors, or our products in a manner that could circumvent our protective safeguards. Therefore, we cannot give you any assurance that our confidential business information will remain proprietary. Any such loss of confidentiality could diminish or eliminate any competitive advantage provided by our proprietary information. We may incur material losses as a result of product recall and product liability . We may be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury, illness or death. We also may be required to recall some of our products if they become contaminated or are damaged or mislabeled. A significant product liability judgment against us, or a widespread product recall, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The amount of the insurance we carry is limited, and that insurance is subject to certain exclusions and may or may not be adequate. We rely on our management team and other key personnel. We depend on the skills, experience, relationships, and continued services of key personnel, including our experienced management team. In addition, our ability to achieve our operating goals also depends on our ability to recruit, train, and retain qualified individuals. We compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel, and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract and retain additional talented personnel. Any such loss or failure could adversely affect our product sales, financial condition, and operating results. In particular, our continued success will depend in part, on our ability to retain the talents and dedication of key employees. If key employees finalize their employment, become ill as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, or if an insufficient number of employees is retained to maintain effective operations, our business may be adversely affected and our management team may be distracted. Furthermore, we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any of our key employees who leave or be able to offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms, all of which could adversely affect our procurement & distribution processes, sales & marketing activities, financial processes & condition and results of operations. The FDA has not passed on the efficacy of our products or the accuracy of any claim we make related to our products. Although six independent clinical studies have been conducted relating to the calorie-burning and related effects of our products, the results of these studies have not been submitted to or reviewed by the FDA. Further, the FDA has not passed on the efficacy of any of our products nor has it reviewed or passed on any claims we make related to our products, including the claim that our products aid consumers in burning calories or enhancing their metabolism. Risk Factors Relating to Our Industry We are subject to significant competition in the beverage industry . The beverage industry is highly competitive. The principal areas of competition are pricing, packaging, distribution channel penetration, development of new products and flavors and marketing campaigns. Our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of manufacturers, most of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution resources and name recognition than we do. Important factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include the taste and flavor of our products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective development of new, unique cutting-edge products, attractive and different packaging, branded product advertising and pricing. Our products compete with all liquid refreshments and with products of much larger and substantially better financed competitors, including the products of numerous nationally and internationally known producers, such as The Coca Cola Company, Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, PepsiCo, Inc., Nestle, Waters North America, Inc., Hansen Natural Corp. and Red Bull. We also compete with companies that are smaller or primarily local in operation. Our products also compete with private label brands such as those carried by supermarket chains, convenience store chains, drug store chains, mass merchants and club warehouses. There can be no assurance that we will compete successfully in the functional beverage industry. The failure to do so would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We compete in an industry that is brand-conscious, so brand name recognition and acceptance of our products are critical to our success and significant marketing and advertising could be needed to achieve and sustain brand recognition. Our business is substantially dependent upon awareness and market acceptance of our products and brands by our targeted consumers. Our business depends on acceptance by our independent distributors of our brand as one that has the potential to provide incremental sales growth rather than reduce distributors’ existing beverage sales. The development of brand awareness and market acceptance is likely to require significant marketing and advertising expenditures. There can be no assurance that Celsius ® will achieve and maintain satisfactory levels of acceptance by independent distributors and retail consumers. Any failure of the Celsius ® brand to maintain or increase acceptance or market penetration would likely have a material adverse effect on business, financial condition and results of operations. Our sales are affected by seasonality. As is typical in the beverage industry, our sales are seasonal. Our highest sales volumes generally occur in the second and third quarters, which correspond to the warmer months of the year in our major markets. Consumer demand for our products is also affected by weather conditions. Cool, wet spring or summer weather could result in decreased sales of our beverages and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Our business is subject to many regulations and noncompliance is costly . The production, marketing and sale of our beverage products are subject to the rules and regulations of various federal, state and local health agencies. The marketing and sale of our products internationally is similarly subject to compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations in those foreign countries where our products are sold. If a regulatory authority finds that a current or future product or production run is not in compliance with any of these regulations, we may be fined, or production may be stopped, thus adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, any adverse publicity associated with any noncompliance may damage our reputation and our ability to successfully market our products. Furthermore, the rules and regulations are subject to change from time to time and while we closely monitor developments in this area, we have no way of anticipating whether changes in these rules and regulations will impact our business adversely. Additional or revised regulatory requirements, whether labeling, environmental, tax or otherwise, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risk Factors Relating to our Status as a Fully Reporting Public Company We are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act that require us to incur audit fees and legal fees in connection with the preparation of such reports. These additional costs could reduce or eliminate our ability to earn a profit. We are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and as a result, we are now required to file periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “ SEC ”) pursuant to the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. In order to comply with these requirements, our independent registered public accounting firm has to review our financial statements on a quarterly basis and audit our financial statements on an annual basis. Moreover, our legal counsel has to review and assist in the preparation of such reports. The costs charged by these professionals for such services cannot be accurately predicted at this time because factors such as the number and type of transactions that we engage in and the complexity of our reports cannot be determined at this time and will have a major effect on the amount of time to be spent by our auditors and attorneys. However, the incurrence of such costs will obviously be an expense to our operations and thus have a negative effect on our ability to meet our overhead requirements and earn a profit. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our common stock, if a market ever develops, could drop significantly. If we do not maintain an effective internal control environment as well as adequate control procedures over our financial reporting, investor confidence may be adversely affected thereby affecting the value of our stock price We are required to maintain proper internal control over our financial reporting and adequate controls related to our disclosures. As defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. If we fail to maintain adequate controls, our business, the results of operations, financial condition and/or the value of our stock may be adversely impacted. Risk Factors Related to our Common Stock We cannot guarantee the continued existence of an active established public trading market for our common stock. Our common stock currently is listed for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Trading in stock quoted on the Nasdaq Capital Market may often experience wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance. Market prices for our common stock may also be influenced by a number of other factors, including: Our board of directors has the authority, without shareholder approval, to issue preferred stock with terms that may not be beneficial to common shareholders and with the ability to affect adversely shareholder voting power and perpetuate their control over us. Our Articles of Incorporation allows our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without any vote or further action by our shareholders. Our board of directors has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock. As a result, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation, the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock and the right to the redemption of the shares, together with a premium, prior to the redemption of our common stock. The ability of our principal shareholders to control our business may limit or eliminate minority shareholders’ ability to influence corporate affairs. Our principal shareholders own common stock and/or preferred stock which holds a majority of the voting power of our issued and outstanding capital. Accordingly, they will be able to effectively control the election of directors, as well as all other matters requiring shareholder approval. The interests of our principal shareholders may differ from the interests of other shareholders with respect to the issuance of shares, business transactions with or sales to other companies, selection of other directors and other business decisions. The minority shareholders have no way of overriding decisions made by our principal shareholders. This level of control may also have an adverse impact on the market value of our shares because our principal shareholders may institute or undertake transactions, policies or programs that result in losses, may not take any steps to increase our visibility in the financial community and / or may sell sufficient numbers of shares to significantly decrease our price per share. We do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future . We have never paid cash dividends on our common stock. We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock at any time in the foreseeable future. The future payment of dividends directly depends upon our future earnings, capital requirements, financial requirements and other factors that our board of directors will consider. Since we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock, return on your investment, if any, will depend solely on an increase, if any, in the market value of our common stock. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. Not applicable. Item 2. Properties. We do not own any real property. We lease our principal executive offices located at 2424 N Federal Highway, Boca Raton, Florida 33431. Our premises are leased for a monthly cost of $17,295 which now includes an additional 2,140 square-feet. The current lease expires on January 2024. The Company has no warehouses or other facilities as we store our product at third party contract warehouse facilities. We also have leased premises in Europe which have an aggregate monthly cost of approximately $11,600 which include the unfavorable foreign currency impact. These leases have different periods and extend until August 2023. Item 3. Legal Proceedings. As previously reported in our periodic filings under the Exchange Act, on January 24, 2020, Evlution Nutrition, LLC (“ Evlution ”) filed suit against Celsius in federal court for the Southern District of Florida, for trademark infringement. Evlution asserted that Celsius’ BCAA dietary supplement product’s use of BCAA + ENERGY infringed upon Evlution’s registered trademarks. In October 2020, the Company resolved its dispute with Evlution by entering into a co-existence agreement under which both parties agreed not to challenge the others’ use of the BCAA Energy/BCAA+Energy marks. No other consideration was paid for the settlement. In addition to other matters previously reported in our periodic filings under the Exchange Act, from time to time, we may become party to litigation or other legal proceedings that we consider to be a part of the ordinary course of our business. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. PART II Item 5. Market Price of and Dividends on the Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. Market Information Our common stock has been listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “ CELH .” Dividends We have never paid cash dividends on our common stock. We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock at any time in the foreseeable future. The future payment of dividends directly depends upon our future earnings, capital requirements, financial requirements and other factors that our board of directors will consider. Securities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities Not Applicable . Item 6. Selected Financial Data Not applicable to the Company because we are a “ smaller reporting company .” Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. You should read the following discussion in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the corresponding notes, the unaudited financial statements and the corresponding notes included elsewhere in this information statement. This Item 7 contains forward-looking statements. The matters discussed in these forward-looking statements are subject to risk, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those made, projected or implied in the forward-looking statements. Please refer to “ Item 1A. Risk Factors ” for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. Results of Operations Results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 include the operations of Func Food for the entire year, while results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 include the operations for Func Food beginning only as of the date of acquisition, October 25, 2019. Year ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019 Revenue For the year ended December 31, 2020, revenue was approximately $130.7 million, an increase of $55.6 million or 74.0% from $75.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Approximately 64% of this growth was as a result of increased revenues from North America where 2020 revenues were $95.5 million, an increase of $35.8 million or 60.0% from 2019. The balance of the increase was largely attributable to a 35% growth in European revenues to $33.7 million in 2020 from $14.5 million in 2019. 2020 results reflect the full financial impact of the consolidation of the results of operations of Func Food, which Celsius acquired in October 2019. Asian revenues (which primarily consist of royalty revenues from our China licensee) for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $1.1million, an increase of 30.0% from $840,648 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Other international markets generated $425,323 in revenues during the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $234,379 from $190,944 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The total increase in revenue from 2019 period to 2020 was primarily attributable to increases in sales volume, as opposed to increases in product pricing. The primary factors behind the increase in North American sales volume were related to growth in e-commerce channel, which accounted for 20.0% of the growth and expansion in our DSD distributor network which generated significant revenue increases when compared to 2019. As noted above, the full consolidation of Func Food revenue in 2020 as well as the favorable impact of the strengthening of the Euro also beneficially impacted revenues. We estimate that the strengthening of the Euro accounted for approximately 5.0% of the increase in European revenue in 2020 as compared to 2019. The following table sets forth the amount of revenues by category and changes therein for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019: Gross profit For the year ended December 31, 2020, gross profit increased by approximately $29.7 million or 94.8% to $61.0 million, from $31.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Gross profit margins increased to 46.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 41.7% for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in gross profit dollars and gross profit margins is mainly related to increases in volume, as opposed to increases in product pricing. Specifically, we estimate that increases in volume account for approximately 90% of the growth in gross profit (expressed in dollars) from 2019 to 2020. The impact of lower promotional allowances, together with supply chain savings or synergies as well as the favorable impact of the strength of the Euro accounted for the remaining approximately 10% of increase in gross profit dollars in 2020 when compared to 2019. Sales and marketing expenses Sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were approximately $34.9 million, an increase of approximately $13.7 million or 65.1% from approximately $21.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase reflects the impact of the consolidation of the operating results of Func Food following its October 2019 acquisition by the Company. As a result, our marketing investments increased by 81.3% or $6.4 million from 2019 to 2020. Similarly, all other sales and marketing expenses give effect to increases related to the consolidation of Func Food’s operations. Specifically, employee costs for 2020, which also include investments in human resources to properly service our markets, increased by $4.1 million or 62.1% from 2019. We estimated the currency impact to account for approximately $230,000 of the increase regarding employee costs when compared to the prior year. Moreover, due to the increase in business volume, our support to distributors, investments in trade activities and storage and distribution costs increased by $3.2 million from 2019 to 2020. General and administrative expenses General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were approximately $18.2 million, an increase of $6.6 million or 56.5% from $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase similarly reflects the full impact of the consolidation of Func Food’s operations for the entire 2020 year, which was present only for part of 2019 following the acquisition date on October 25, 2019. As such, administrative expenses reflected an increase of $2.6 million, which included an increase of approximately $260,000 in our bad debt reserve, to cover potential collectability risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Employee costs for the year ended December 31, 2020, reflect an increase of $1.6 million or 54.5%, not only attributable to the consolidation of Func Food’s operations, but also additional investments in resources in order to properly support our higher business volume. Additionally, we estimated the currency impact to account for 2% of the increase in employee costs when compared to the prior year. All other increases for general and administrative expenses from 2019 to 2020 amounted to $2.4 million. These increases are mainly the result of higher stock option expense of $1.5 million, depreciation and amortization of $835,000 and net increases in all other administrative expenses of $82,000. Other Income/(expense) Total net other Income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $730,000 which reflects a variance of 10.6 million when compared to net total other income of $11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The variance of $10.6 million is mainly related to the recognition of a gain of $12.2 million pertaining to a note receivable from our Chinese licensee. The note receivable is the part of an agreement executed with our China distributor, related to the restructuring of our business relationship to a royalty-based model, which requires the repayment, over a five-year period, pursuant to an unsecured, interest-bearing note, of the investment the Company made in the China market during 2017 and 2018. Net Income/Loss As a result of all of the above, for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company had net income of $8.5 million or $0.12 per share based on a weighted average of 70,195,085 shares outstanding and $0.11 per share based on a weighted average of 74,443,601 shares outstanding, which includes the dilutive impact of outstanding stock options to purchase 4,248,516 shares. In comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2019 there was net income of $10.0 million or $0.16 per share based on a weighted average of 60,761,995 shares outstanding, and after adding back interest expense on convertible notes of $348,493 and the amortization on discount on notes payable of $239,570, a diluted net income of $10.6 million or $0.16 per share based on a weighted average of 64,183,399 shares outstanding, which includes the dilutive impact of the stock options of 1,153,231 shares and the dilutive effect of the convertible notes of 2,268,173 shares. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, we had cash of approximately $43.2 million and $23.1 million, respectively, and working capital of approximately $64.9 million and $24.8 million, respectively. In addition to cash flow from operations, our primary sources of working capital have been private placements and public offerings of our securities (including a private placement of 1,437,909 shares at a price of $15.30 completed on August 25, 2020 and an underwritten public offering of 7,986,110 shares at an offering price of $3.60 per share completed on September 16, 2019). Our current operating plan for the next twelve (12) months reflects sufficient financial resources, notwithstanding the potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic nevertheless; we do not contemplate obtaining additional financing. Cash flows provided by operating activities Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $3.4 million in 2020, representing a $2.4 million increase from $1.0 million in 2019. The increase was primarily driven by operating income adjusted for non-cash-items. The increase was further driven by efficient management of accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities. Partially offsetting the increase in cash flows from operating activities was an increase in expenditures for prepaid expenses and other assets mainly related to deposits for inventory production, an increase accounts receivable mainly related to increase in sales volume and elimination of accounts receivable financing in Europe, as well as increased inventory levels to properly service demand for our products. Cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities Cash flows provided by investing activities totaled $0.8 million in 2020, representing a $15.1 million increase from net cash used in investing activities of $14.3 million in 2019. The increase was primarily due to the fact that 2019 included $14.2 million of cash consideration paid for the Func Food acquisition. The increase was further driven by collections of $1.3 million under a note receivable, which began in 2020. Partially offsetting the increase in cash flows provided by investing activities was an increase in capital expenditures of $0.5 million, primarily attributable to the purchase of computer equipment and equipment utilized for trade-marketing and merchandising. Cash flows provided by financing activities Cash flows provided by financing activities totaled $15.6 million for 2020, representing a $13.1 million decrease from $28.7 in 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the fact that the Company fully repaid bonds in 2020 for $9.6 million and a $5.0 million difference in the amount of proceeds raised from common stock issuances in 2019 versus 2020. The decrease was further driven by the fact that 2019 included $1.5 million of proceeds received from a related party note and 2020 included cash paid for taxes on restricted stock of $0.7 million. Additionally, principal payments under finance leases increased by $0.255 million in 2020 mainly because Func Food was included in the Company’s consolidated results for the entire year, as opposed to only part of Q4 in 2019, as well as increased leasing activity. Partially offsetting the decrease in cash flows provided by financing activities was a $3.9 million increase in proceeds from stock option exercises, primarily driven by increased stock price and vesting of options. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2020, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Not applicable. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data The financial statements and supplementary data listed in “ Item 15. Financials Statements and Exhibits ” are attached to this Report. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure Not applicable. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. Disclosure controls and procedures Our President and Chief Executive Officer as well as our Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of December 31, 2020, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms adopted by the SEC, including to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial and accounting officer), or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of December 31, 2020, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in that (a) we maintain records that in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (b) our records provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and board of directors; and (c) our records provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. Our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer do not expect that our disclosure controls or internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. Although our disclosure controls and procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our principal executive officer and our Chief Financial Officer have determined that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at doing so, a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented if there exists in an individual a desire to do so. There can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the framework set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013). Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and financial officers and effected by the Company’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: Based on the evaluation conducted under the above-referenced framework, our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of December 31, 2020, our internal control over financial reporting was effective. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm Effective with the filing of this report, with respect to the Company's fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, the Company is deemed to be a “ non-accelerated filer ” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Accordingly, this annual report is not required to include an attestation report of the Company's registered public accounting firm on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. With respect to the Company’s fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, the Company was deemed to be an “ accelerated filer ” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Accordingly, for only the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, we have included the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm in Item 8 setting forth our registered public accounting firm’s attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Item 308 (b) of Regulation S-K. Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting Following the October 25, 2019 acquisition of our European subsidiaries, the Company committed time and resources to consolidating and integrating the subsidiaries’ system of controls with its own and evaluating control design, implementation, and effectiveness. This included incorporating the Company’s policies into the subsidiaries’ policies and aligning their internal control environment with ours. We also obtained the services of Grant Thornton in the Nordic region to assist with this assessment and the related testing to ensure that their internal controls are aligned with the Company’s and are in place and working effectively. The majority of the control activities of the Company were not changed by the acquisition of our European subsidiaries, and the overall impact was not material to our internal controls over financial reporting. There have been no other changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2020, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Celsius Holdings, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Celsius Holdings, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2020, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Collectability of Note Receivable Description of the Matter Effective January 1, 2019, the Company entered into a separate economic agreement for the repayment of its marketing investment in China with Qifeng. Under the repayment agreement, Qifeng agreed to refund the Company over a five-year period. The repayment was formalized via a Note Receivable (“Note”) from Qifeng. The initial outstanding principal under the Note was approximately $12.2 million and was denominated in the Chinese Renminbi (CNY). Installment payments under the Note are due on March 31 each year and the first installment payment on the Note was due March 31, 2020. This payment was delayed and paid in September 2020 due to the COVID 19 pandemic. The next installment payment due March 31, 2021 will be paid via a release of 62,000 shares of Celsius common stock owned by Qifeng. This release will provide sufficient funds to pay the full amount that is due under the second installment payment. Under a separate guarantee agreement the Company will maintain control over 275,079 Celsius common shares which serves as collateral for the payment on the remaining amounts that will become due over the next three-years. We determined based on the fact pattern noted above the long term collectability of the remaining Note balance was as a critical audit matter. The Note is collateralized by the Company’s shares, however we noted that there is volatility relating to the value of the collateral which is based on the share price of the Company’s stock. How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following: 1. Obtaining and testing for reasonableness of management’s analysis to support the collectability of the remaining Note balance. 2. Obtained, a confirmation from Qifeng of the remaining balance due under the Note as of December 31, 2020 as well as confirming their intent and ability to pay the next installment keeping them current with the agreement. 3. Reviewed a signed guarantee letter from Qifeng over the Company shares that are being used as collateral associated with the remainder of the Note. 4. Obtained the Qifeng account statement from the Company’s transfer agent verifying the number of shares owned by Qifeng. The value of the collateral shares at December 31, 2020 was in excess of the total note receivable balance as of December 31, 2020. Based on the procedures performed and evidence obtained we concluded that no allowance for collectability was required related to the Note as of December 31, 2020. /s/ Assurance Dimensions We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2017 Margate, Florida March 10, 2021 To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Celsius Holdings, Inc. Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Celsius Holdings, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2019 and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). As described in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded the acquired business of Func Food Group, from management’s report on internal control over financial reporting. We also excluded the acquired business from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders’ Equity For the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements Celsius Holdings, Inc. Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2020 and 2019 Business —Celsius Holdings, Inc. (the “ Company ” or “ Celsius Holdings ”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on April 26, 2005. On January 24, 2007, the Company entered into a merger agreement and plan of reorganization with Elite FX, Inc., a Florida corporation. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Elite FX, Inc. was merged into the Company’s subsidiary, Celsius, Inc. and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company on January 26, 2007. In addition, on March 28, 2007 the Company established Celsius Netshipments, Inc. a Florida corporation as a subsidiary of the Company. On February 7, 2018, the Company established Celsius Asia Holdings Limited a Hong Kong corporation as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. On February 7, 2018 Celsius China Holdings Limited a Hong Kong corporation became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Celsius Asia Holdings Limited and on May 9, 2018, Celsius Asia Holdings Limited established Celsius (Beijing) Beverage Limited, a China corporation as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Celsius Asia Holdings Limited. On October 25, 2019, the Company acquired 100% of Func Food Group, Oyj (“ Func Food ”). The Acquisition was structured as a purchase of all of Func Food’s equity shares and a restructuring of Func Food’s pre-existing debt. Func Food was the Nordic distributor for the Company since 2015. Func Food is a marketer and distributor of nutritional supplements, health food products, and beverages (see note 10). The Company is engaged in the development, marketing, sale and distribution of “ functional ” calorie-burning fitness beverages under the Celsius® brand name. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”). Consolidation Policy — The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Celsius Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All material inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Significant Estimates — The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts, allowance for inventory obsolescence, the useful lives and values of property, fixtures and equipment, impairment of intangible assets & goodwill, valuation of stock-based compensation, and deferred tax asset valuation allowance. Reclassification of Prior Year Presentation – Certain prior year amounts in the consolidated statements of cash flows have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation. An adjustment has been made to present certain changes in operating assets and liabilities related to the China Settlement as part of the total net changes in operating assets and liabilities, rather than as separately presented items. Additionally, modifications have been made to present the effects of depreciation & amortization, bad debt allowance and inventory excess and obsolescence allowance as adjustments to reconcile net income/(loss) to net cash flows from operating activities, rather than as part of changes in operating assets and liabilities. Lastly, right-of-use assets and lease liabilities related to finance leases have been separately presented from those related to operating leases in the consolidated balance sheets. These reclassifications had no effect on previously reported cash flows from operating, investing, or financing activities. Segment Reporting — Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise that engage in business activities, have discrete financial information, and whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker (CODM) to make decisions about allocating resources and to assess performance. Even though we have operations in several geographies, we operate as a single enterprise. Our operations and strategies are centrally designed and executed given that our geographical components are very similar. Our CODM, the CEO, reviews operating results primarily from a consolidated perspective, and makes decisions and allocates resources based on that review. The reason our CODM focuses on consolidated results in making decisions and allocating resources is because of the significant economic interdependencies between our geographical operations and the Company’s U.S. entity. Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2020 and 2019 Concentrations of Risk — Substantially all of the Company’s revenue derives from the sale of Celsius ® beverages. The Company uses single supplier relationships for its raw materials purchases and filling capacity, which potentially subjects the Company to a concentration of business risk. If these suppliers had operational problems or ceased making product available to the Company, operations could be adversely affected. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with high-quality financial institutions. At times, balances in the Company’s cash accounts may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit. At December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately $43 million in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had the following 10 percent or greater concentrations of revenue with its customers. Specifically, there is one customer that has accounted for approximately 15% and 12% of our revenue, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The below table reflects this customer’s evolution as a percentage of our total revenue. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had the following 10 percent or greater concentrations of accounts receivable with its customers: Cash Equivalents — The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company did not have any investments with maturities of three months or less. Accounts Receivable — Accounts receivable are reported at net realizable value. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors pertaining to the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends, and other information. Delinquent accounts are written-off when it is determined that the amounts are uncollectible. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, there was an allowance for doubtful accounts of $549,573 and $292,400, respectively. Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2020 and 2019 Inventories — Inventories include only the purchase cost and are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined using the FIFO method. Inventories consist of raw materials and finished products. The Company establishes an inventory reserve to reduce the value of the inventory during the period in which such materials and products are no longer usable or marketable. Specifically, the Company reviews inventory utilization during the past twelve months and also customer orders for subsequent months. If there has been no utilization during the last 12 months and there are no orders in-place in future months which will require the use of inventory item, then inventory item will be included as part of the reserve during the period being evaluated. Management will then specifically evaluate whether these items may be utilized within a reasonable time frame (e.g., 3 to 6 months). At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company recorded an allowance of $1,613,000 and $865,000 respectively. The changes in the allowance are included in cost of revenue. Property and Equipment — Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation of property and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset generally ranging from three to seven years. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets — In accordance with ASC Topics 350 “Goodwill and Other Intangibles” and 360, “Property, Plant, and Equipment” the Company reviews the carrying value of intangibles and other long-lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of long-lived assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the undiscounted cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the property, if any, exceeds its fair value. The Company did not record any impairment during the year ended December 31, 2020. Long-lived Asset Geographic Data The following table sets forth long-lived asset information which includes property plant and equipment and lease right of use assets and excludes goodwill and intangibles, where individual countries represent a material portion of the total: Goodwill — The Company records goodwill when the consideration paid for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, including related tax effects. Goodwill is not amortized; instead, goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if the Company believes indicators of impairment exist. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the Company determines that the fair value is less than the carrying value, the Company will recognize an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying value over its fair value. At December 31, 2020, there were no indicators of impairment. Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2020 and 2019 Intangible assets – Intangible assets are comprised of customer relationships and brands acquired in a business combination. The Company amortizes intangible assets with a definitive life over their respective useful lives. Intangibles with indefinite lives are tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if the Company believes indicators of impairment exist. Revenue Recognition — The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers.” The Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied. Product sales occur once control is transferred upon delivery to the customer. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods. The amount of consideration the Company receives and revenue the Company recognizes varies with changes in customer incentives the Company offers to its customers and their customers. Sales taxes and other similar taxes are excluded from revenue. Customer Advances — From time to time the Company requires deposits in advance of delivery of products and/or production runs. Such amounts are initially recorded as customer advances liability within other current liabilities. The Company recognizes such revenue as it is earned in accordance with revenue recognition policies. As of December 31, 2020, and 2019, the Company did not have any customer advances. Advertising Costs — Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. The Company uses mainly radio, local sampling events, sponsorships, endorsements, and digital advertising. The Company incurred marketing and advertising expenses of approximately $14.2 million and $7.9 million, during years ending December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Research and Development — Research and development costs are charged to general and administrative expenses as incurred and consist primarily of consulting fees, raw material usage and test productions of beverages. The Company incurred expenses of $508,000 and $341,000 during years ending December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Foreign Currency Translation — Foreign subsidiaries’ functional currency is the local currency of operations and the net assets of foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates. The U.S. dollar results that arise from such translation, as well as exchange gains and losses on intercompany balances of long-term investment nature, are included in Comprehensive Income. The Company incurred foreign currency translation net gains during the year ended December 31, 2020 of approximately $27,000 and net losses of approximately $60,600 during the year ended December 31, 2019. Our operations in different countries required that we transact in the following currencies: Chinese-Yuan Norwegian-Krone Swedish-Krona Finland-Euro The Company’s results now include the operations of our European entities for the entire year ended December 31, 2020. During this period the currencies in these countries appreciated considerably when compared to the US Dollar giving way to significant currency gains which are reflected in our consolidated results. Fair Value of Financial Instruments — The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates fair value due to their relative short-term maturity and market interest rates. Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2020 and 2019 Fair Value Measurements - ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally, ASC 820 requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized below: Other than these noted previously, the Company did not have any other assets or liabilities measured at fair value at December 31, 2020 and 2019. Income Taxes — The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the provisions of ASC 740-10, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” which requires, among other things, an asset and liability approach to calculating deferred income taxes. The asset and liability approach require the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets for which management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred asset will not be realized. The Company follows the provisions of the ASC 740 -10 related to, Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Positions. When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10, the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Income Taxes (continued) — Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. The Company believes its tax positions are all highly certain of being upheld upon examination. As such, the Company has not recorded a liability for uncertain tax benefits. The Company has adopted ASC 740-10-25 Definition of Settlement, which provides guidance on how an entity should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits and provides that a tax position can be effectively settled upon the completion of an examination by a taxing authority without being legally extinguished. For tax positions considered effectively settled, an entity would recognize the full amount of tax benefit, even if the tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained based solely on the basis of its technical merits and the statute of limitations remains open. Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2020 and 2019 The Company’s tax returns for tax years in 2018 through 2020 remain subject to potential examination by the taxing authorities. Earnings per Share — Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income available to stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share are computed using the weighted average number of common and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding during the period. Under ASC 260-10-45-16, the calculation of diluted earnings per share, the numerator should be adjusted to add back any convertible dividends and the after-tax amount of interest recognized in the period associated with any convertible debt. The denominator should include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued. Please refer to the below table for additional details: Share-Based Payments —The Company follows the provisions of ASC Topic 718 “Compensation — Stock Compensation” and related interpretations. As such, compensation cost is measured on the date of grant at the fair value of the share-based payments. Such compensation amounts, if any, are amortized over the respective vesting periods of the grants. On April 30, 2015, the Company adopted the 2015 Stock Incentive Plan. This plan is intended to provide incentives which will attract and retain highly competent persons at all levels as employees of the Company, as well as independent contractors providing consulting or advisory services to the Company, by providing them opportunities to acquire the Company’s common stock or to receive monetary payments based on the value of such shares pursuant to Awards issued. The 2015 Plan permits the grant of options and shares for up to 5,000,000 shares. In addition, there is a provision for an annual increase of 15% to the shares included under the plan, with the shares to be added on the first day of each calendar year, beginning on January 1, 2017 (note 17). As of December 31, 2020, total shares available are 2.0 million. Cost of Sales — Cost of sales consists of the cost of concentrates and or beverage bases, the costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of products, co-packing fees, repacking fees, in-bound & out-bound freight charges, as well as certain internal transfer costs, warehouse expenses incurred prior to the manufacture of the Company’s finished products, inventory allowance for excess and obsolete products, and certain quality control costs. Raw materials account for the largest portion of the cost of sales. Raw materials include cans, bottles, other containers, flavors, ingredients and packaging materials. Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2020 and 2019 Operating Expenses — Operating expenses include selling expenses such as warehousing expenses after manufacture, as well as expenses for advertising, samplings and in-store demonstrations costs, costs for merchandise displays, point-of-sale materials and premium items, sponsorship expenses, other marketing expenses and design expenses. Operating expenses also include such costs as payroll costs, travel costs, professional service fees (including legal fees), depreciation and other general and administrative costs. Shipping and Handling Costs — Shipping and handling costs for freight expense on goods shipped are included in cost of sales. Freight expense on goods shipped for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $9.5 million and $6.3 million, respectively. Recent Accounting Pronouncements The Company adopts all applicable, new accounting pronouncements as of the specified effective dates. In September 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326) (“ASU 2016-13”), which requires the immediate recognition of management’s estimates of current and expected credit losses. In November 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-19, which makes certain improvements to Topic 326. In April and May 2019, the FASB issued ASUs 2019-04 and 2019-05, respectively, which adds codification improvements and transition relief for Topic 326. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10, which delays the effective date of Topic 326 for Smaller Reporting Companies to interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-11, which makes improvements to certain areas of Topic 326. In February 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-02, which adds an SEC paragraph, pursuant to the issuance of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 119, to Topic 326. Topic 326 is effective for the Company for fiscal years and interim reporting periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements. On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU No. 2017-04, “Intangibles and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment”, which eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill, but rather requires an entity to record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying value over its fair value. Adoption of this ASU did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurements (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. The amendments in this update modify the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements in Topic 820. Adoption of this ASU did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. All new accounting pronouncements issued but not yet effective are not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position with the exception of the updated previously disclosed above, there have been no new accounting pronouncements not yet effective that have significance to our consolidated financial statements. Liquidity — These financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will be able to continue as a going concern. At December 31, 2020, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $54,902,447 which includes a net income available to common stockholders of $8,523,849 for year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ending December 31, 2020 the Company’s net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately $3,395,084 . If our sales volumes do not meet our projections, expenses exceed our expectations, our plans change, we may be unable to generate enough cash flow from operations to cover our working capital requirements. In such case, we may be required to adjust our business plan, by reducing marketing, lower our working capital requirements and reduce other expenses or seek additional financing. Furthermore, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in the global macro-economic environment related to the pandemic and public health crises related to the COVID-19 outbreak. We are closely monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic and its potential impact to our business. While we do not expect that the COVID-19 pandemic will have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operations at this time, we are unable to accurately predict the impact that COVID-19 will have due to the uncertainties which include the ultimate geographic spread of the virus, the intensity of the virus, the duration of the outbreak, and/or actions that may be taken by governmental agencies. Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2020 and 2019 The Company recognizes revenue when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied. Product sales occur once control is transferred upon delivery to the customer. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods. The amount of consideration the Company receives and revenue the Company recognizes varies with changes in customer incentives the Company offers to its customers and their customers. Sales taxes and other similar taxes are excluded from revenue. Information about the Company’s net sales by reporting segment for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is as follows: All of the Company’s North America revenue is derived from the United States, which is the Company’s country of domicile. Of the Company’s total foreign revenues of $35.2 million and $15.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, the only individual country that represents a material portion of total consolidated revenue was Sweden, which had total revenues of approximately $23.1 million and $8.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Revenues are attributed to countries based on the location of the customer. License Agreement In January 2019, the Company entered into a license and repayment of investment agreement with Qifeng Food Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd (“Qifeng”). Under the agreement, Qifeng was granted the exclusive license rights to manufacture, market and commercialize Celsius branded products in China. The term of the agreement is 50 years, with annual royalty fees due from Qifeng after the end of each calendar year. The royalty fees are based on a percentage of Qifeng’s sales of Celsius branded products; however, the fees are fixed for the first five years of the agreement, totaling approximately $6.9 million, and then are subject to annual guaranteed minimums over the remaining term of the agreement. Under the agreement, the Company grants Qifeng exclusive license rights and provides ongoing support in product development, brand promotion and technical expertise. The ongoing support is integral to the exclusive license rights and, as such, both of these represent a combined, single performance obligation. The transaction price consists of the guaranteed minimums and the variable royalty fees, all of which are allocated to the single performance obligation. The Company recognizes revenue from the agreement over time because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits from the services. The Company uses the passage of time to measure progress towards satisfying its performance obligation because its efforts in providing the exclusive license rights and ongoing support occur on a generally even basis throughout the year. Total revenue recognized under the agreement was approximately $770,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, determined by the minimum royalties due as per the licensing agreement, and is reflected in the Company’s Asia reporting segment. Inventories consist of the following at: Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2020 and 2019 Prepaid expenses and other current assets total $14,626,922 and $4,170,136, at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and consist mainly of prepaid advances to co-packers related to inventory production, advertising, prepaid insurance, prepaid slotting fees, value added tax payments and deposits on purchases. The increase of approximately $10,500,000 is mainly related to advances to co-packers pertaining to inventory production. Note receivable consists of the following at: Effective January 1, 2019, we restructured our China distribution efforts by entering into two separate agreements as it relates to the commercialization of our Celsius products (i.e., license agreement) and a repayment of investment agreement with Qifeng. Under the license agreement, Qifeng was granted the exclusive license rights to manufacture, market and commercialize Celsius® brand products in China. Qifeng will pay a minimum royalty fee of $6.9 million for the five years of the term of the agreement, transitioning to a volume-based royalty fee, thereafter. Under a separate economic agreement, Qifeng Food will repay the marketing investments made by Celsius into the China market through 2018, over the same five-year period. The repayment, which was formalized via a Note Receivable from Qifeng, will need to be serviced even if the licensing agreement is cancelled or terminated. The initial outstanding principal under the Note was approximately $12.2 million which is denominated in Chinese Renminbi (CNY) and was recorded as Other Income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2019. The amount recognized considered the net of the balances of the accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, as well as the marketing investments that were performed in the China market. Scheduled principal payments plus accrued interest are due annually on March 31 of each year starting in 2020. The Note is recorded at amortized cost basis and accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to the weighted average of 5% of the outstanding principal up to $5 million and 2% of the outstanding principal above $5 million. On September 12, 2020, it was agreed to fix the interest rate at 3.21% which reflected the weighted average interest rate for the 5-year period of the Note. For the year ended December 31, 2020, interest income was approximately $356,000. The Company assesses the Note for impairment periodically by evaluating whether it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all the contractual interest and principal payments as scheduled in the Note agreement, based on historical experience about Qifeng’s ability to pay, the current economic environment and other factors. If the Note is determined to be impaired, the impairment is measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flows under the Note, discounted at the Note’s effective interest rate. At December 31, 2020, the Note was not deemed to be impaired. The first installment of the note and interest of RMB 10,848,193 as well as royalties in the amount of RMB 2,404,900 were due on March 31, 2020. We were requested to provide a 3-month consideration to delay payment until June 30, 2020, due to the impact of the health crisis in China. As of June 30, 2020, we received payment of the RMB 10,848,193. An additional extension of 3-months was requested regarding the payment of the RMB 2,404,900 pertaining to the royalties. As of September 30, 2020, we received payment in full of the royalties that were due. Both the Note and related payments are subject to foreign currency fluctuations. In order to grant the aforementioned considerations, a guarantee was obtained for the full amount of the royalties that were payable as of September 30, 2020, as well as the amounts that become due on March 31, 2021 pertaining to the Note, related interest and royalties. As collateral, we have maintained a stock certificate in Celsius Holdings, Inc., which amounted to 337,079 shares. In order to obtain payment pertaining to amounts that are due on March 31, 2021, we will release 62,000 shares which will provide sufficient funds to pay in full the amount that is due regarding the Note, interest and royalties. We will maintain the remaining 275,079 shares as collateral or guarantee of payment on the remaining amounts that will become due over the next three-years. As such, royalties, principal and interest are expected to be paid in full when they become due. Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2020 and 2019 The Company’s leasing activities include an operating lease of its corporate office space from a related party (see Note 14) and several other operating and finance leases of vehicles and office space for the Company’s European operations. At the inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. The Company’s assessment is based on: (1) whether the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (2) whether the Company obtains the right to substantially all the economic benefit from the use of the asset throughout the term, and (3) whether the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. The Company allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease and non-lease component based on the component’s relative stand-alone price to determine the lease payments. Lease and non-lease components are accounted for separately. Leases are classified as either finance leases or operating leases based on criteria in ASC Topic 842, “Leases”. The Company’s operating leases are generally comprised of real estate and vehicles, and the Company’s finance leases are generally comprised of vehicles. At lease commencement, the Company records a lease liability equal to the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. A corresponding right-of-use asset (“ROU asset”) is recorded, measured based on the initial measurement of the lease liability. ROU assets also include any lease payments made and exclude lease incentives. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for operating leases, consisting of lease payments, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Included in lease expense are any variable lease payments incurred in the period that were not included in the initial lease liability. Lease expense for finance leases consists of the amortization of the ROU asset on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the lease term, and interest expense is calculated using the effective interest rate method.

Goodwill consists of approximately $10,419,321 resulting from the excess of the consideration paid and the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired from the Func Food Acquisition (see note 10). As detailed in note 10, goodwill increased by $395,000 in 2020. There was no other activity related to goodwill during the year ended December 31, 2020. Intangible assets consist of acquired customer relationships and brands from the Func Food Acquisition. The gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of intangible assets were as follows as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019: Customer relationships are amortized over an estimated useful life of 25 years and brands have an indefinite life. Amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $582,917. There was no amortization expense related to intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2019. Other fluctuations in the amounts of intangible assets are due to currency translation adjustments. The following is the future estimated amortization expense related to customer relationships as of December 31, 2020: Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2020 and 2019 The Company acquired 100% of Func Food Group, Oyj (“Func Food) on October 25, 2019 (“the Acquisition”). The Acquisition was structured as a purchase of all of Func Food’s equity shares and a restructuring of Func Food’s pre-existing debt. Total consideration was $27,060,701, which consisted of approximately $14,188,000 in cash, $8,357,000 of newly issued bonds (see note 13) and $4,516,000 related to the settlement of a pre-existing debt. In addition to the aforementioned bond issuance, the Company financed the acquisition by issuing new common shares. Func Food is a marketer and distributor of nutritional supplements, health food products and beverages, that support sport activities and healthy living and lifestyles in Finland, Sweden, and Norway. Func Food has been the Nordic distributor of Celsius products since 2015 and, as a result of the acquisition, the Company expects to further increase its Nordic market share by leveraging collaborations, revamping its marketing strategy and focusing on core products. It also expects to reduce costs through economies of scale. The Company recorded the acquisition in accordance with ASC Topic 805, pertaining to business combinations. The following table summarizes the consideration paid for Func Food and the amounts of the assets acquired at fair market value and liabilities assumed recognized at the Acquisition date. During the year ended December 31, 2020, goodwill increased by approximately $395,000 due to an additional liability that the Company assumed from the Func Food Acquisition. The additional liability consisted of charges related to an uncertain fiscal position reflected in a 2016 filing. This increase in liabilities and goodwill was recorded as a measurement period adjustment to the net assets acquired from the Func Food Acquisition. The additional liability is reflected in other current liabilities. The amounts of revenue and earnings of Func Food included in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows: Accounts payable and accrued expenses consist of the following at: Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2020 and 2019 Other current liabilities consist of the following at: Bonds payable consists of the following as of: Bonds were originally issued by Func Food Group, Oyj and were reinstated as part of the purchase consideration to acquire the European Operations (see note 10). On October 30, 2020, the Company fully repaid the Bonds in cash, in accordance with their original terms. The total amount paid was approximately $9.9 million, consisting of $9.6 million of principal and $0.3 million of accrued interest. Original terms of the bonds are as follows: The Bonds are Euro-denominated, unregistered, and were issued on October 25, 2019 at an initial nominal amount of approximately $9.1 million, less discount and issuance costs of approximately $0.7 million. The Bonds accrue interest at a stated interest rate of 6.00% per annum, due semi-annually in arrears, with the first interest payment due on April 30, 2020. The maturity date of the Bonds is October 30, 2020. The Bonds are carried at the nominal amount, less any unamortized discount and issuance costs. The original issuance discount amounted to approximately $381,000. The discount was amortized using the effective interest rate method. As of December 31, 2020, there was zero unamortized discount. Amortization of the discount was approximately $381,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Bond issuance costs amounted to $195,415. The issuance costs were amortized over a straight-line basis, given the short-term nature and that it does not result in a material difference from applying the effective interest rate method. Amortization of the total bond discounts and issuance costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $576,415. Fluctuations in currency resulted in a translation loss of $394,371, for the year ended December 31, 2020. Celsius Holdings, Inc.

The current year tax provision mainly relates to European taxes. The Company has evaluated the global intangible low-taxed income (""GILTI"") and the foreign derived intangible income provisions and will treat any U.S. tax on foreign earnings under GILTI as a current period expense when incurred. The Company currently considers the earnings of its foreign entities to be permanently reinvested outside the United States based on estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs. Accordingly, deferred income taxes have not been recorded for the undistributed earnings of the Company's foreign subsidiaries. The domestic and foreign components of the Company's income before provision for income taxes are as follows: Components of the provision for income taxes are as follows: A reconciliation of the total provision for income taxes after applying the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% to income before provision for income taxes to the reported provision for income taxes are as follows: Celsius Holdings, Inc.

In 2020 our Sweden subsidiary incurred approximately $116,000 of income tax expense due to the inability to fully utilize the NOLs generated from prior periods. The Finland tax rate is 20%. In the Netherlands, timing differences related to interest payments resulted in an uncertain tax position liability of $81,500. Deferred Tax Assets relating to foreign NOLs are being impacted by currency fluctuations. The Company adopted an Incentive Stock Plan on January 18, 2007. This plan is intended to provide incentives which will attract and retain highly competent persons at all levels as employees of the Company, as well as independent contractors providing consulting or advisory services to the Company, by providing them opportunities to acquire the Company’s common stock or to receive monetary payments based on the value of such shares pursuant to Awards issued. While the plan terminates 10 years after the adoption date, issued options have their own schedule of termination.

Options to acquire shares of common stock may be granted at no less than fair market value on the date of grant. Upon exercise, shares of new common stock are issued by the Company. Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2020 and 2019 The Company adopted the 2015 Stock Incentive Plan on April 30, 2015. This plan is intended to provide incentives which will attract and retain highly competent persons at all levels as employees of the Company, as well as independent contractors providing consulting or advisory services to the Company, by providing them opportunities to acquire the Company’s common stock or to receive monetary payments based on the value of such shares pursuant to Awards issued. The 2015 Plan permits the grant of options and shares for up to 5,000,000 shares. In addition, there is a provision for an annual increase of 15% of the shares pertaining to the 2015 plan that are outstanding as of the last day of the prior year. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 2.0 million shares are available. Under the 2015 Stock Incentive Plan, the Company has issued options to purchase approximately 5.2 million shares at an average price of $4.23 with a fair value of $239.6 million.

For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized an expense of approximately $6.3 million and $4.8 million, respectively, of non-cash compensation expense (included in General and Administrative expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations) determined by application of a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following inputs: exercise price, dividend yields, risk-free interest rate, and expected annual volatility. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately $7.2 million of unrecognized pre-tax non-cash compensation expense, which the Company expects to recognize, based on a weighted-average period of 2.01 years. The Company used straight-line amortization of compensation expense over the two to three-year requisite service or vesting period of the grant. The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur. There are options to purchase approximately 2.39 million shares that have vested as of December 31, 2020. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of its stock option awards and warrant issuances. The calculation of the fair value of the awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model is affected by the Company’s stock price on the date of grant as well as assumptions regarding the following: The expected volatility was determined with reference to the historical volatility of the Company’s stock. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination within the valuation model. The expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury rate in effect at the time of grant. Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2020 and 2019 A summary of the status of the Company’s outstanding stock options as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 and changes during the periods ending on that date is as follows: Grant Date Fair Intrinsic Value Average Remaining The following table summarizes information about employee stock options outstanding at December 31, 2020: As of December 31, 2020, the Company had approximately $7,245,000 of unrecognized pre-tax non-cash compensation expense, which the Company expects to recognize, based on a weighted-average period of 2.01 years. Restricted Stock Awards Restricted stock awards are awards of common stock that are subject to restrictions on transfer and to a risk of forfeiture if the holder leaves the Company before the restrictions lapse. The holder of a restricted stock award is generally entitled at all times on and after the date of issuance of the restricted shares to exercise the rights of a shareholder of the Company, including the right to vote the shares. The value of stock awards that vest over time is established by the market price on the date of its grant and generally vests over a period of 3 years. A summary of the Company’s restricted stock activity for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is presented in the following table: The total fair value of shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was approximately $2,947,000 and $314,000, respectively. Unrecognized compensation expense related to outstanding restricted stock awards to employees and directors as of December 31, 2020 was $237,801 and is expected to be expensed over the next 53 months. Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2020 and 2019 In November of 2020, McGovern Capital, Inc. and Kevin McGovern (collectively “McGovern”) filed a claim in arbitration related to its Representative Agreement with Celsius Holdings, Inc. as amended by the first amendment dated August 6, 2016. Pursuant to the Representative Agreement, McGovern is entitled to receive a fee of three percent (3%) of “Net Revenues” received by the Company’s from sales of the Company’s Products in the People’s Republic of China for a period of four years from Initial Commercial Sale (which was September 1, 2017). “Net Revenues” are defined in the Representative Agreement as “the Company’s revenues net of actual discounts applied, credits and returns.” Effective January 1, 2019, the Company restructured its China operations from a distribution arrangement with Qifeng Food Technology (Beijing) Co. Ltd. (“Qifeng”), to a license and royalty arrangement and a loan, pursuant to which Qifeng will market and distribute the Company’s products in China, and Celsius will receive an annual royalty payment. The Company intends to pay McGovern its percentage of the annual royalty payment, but McGovern has objected claiming that McGovern is entitled to be paid commissions on the entire royalty payment and the amount of the loan to Qifeng. The Company intends to defend against McGovern’s claims vigorously and has filed a counterclaim related to McGovern’s failure to comply with the covenant of good faith and fair dealing in the Representative Agreement. This matter is still in its early stages and the Company is unable to predict the outcome at this time. In addition to the foregoing, from time to time, we may become party to litigation or other legal proceedings that we consider to be a part of the ordinary course of our business. The Company has entered into distribution agreements with liquidated damages in case the Company cancels the distribution agreements without Cause. Cause has been defined in various ways. It is management’s belief that no such agreement has created any liability as of December 31, 2020. Additionally, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by the pandemic and public health crises related to the COVID-19 outbreak which is affecting the macro-economic environment. Please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for further details. Between January 1, 2021 and March 10, 2021, the Company issued an aggregate of 322,525 shares of its common stock pursuant to the exercise of stock options granted under the Company’s 2015 Stock Incentive Plan.

Business Overview We are engaged in the development, marketing, sale and distribution of “functional” calorie-burning fitness beverages under the Celsius ® brand name. According to multiple clinical studies we funded, a single serving of Celsius ® burns 100 to 140 calories by increasing a consumer’s resting metabolism an average of 12% and providing sustained energy for up to a three-hour period. Our exercise focused studies show Celsius delivers additional benefits when consumed prior to exercise. The studies show benefits such as increase in fat burn, increase in lean muscle mass and increased endurance. We seek to combine nutritional science with mainstream beverages by using our proprietary thermogenic (calorie-burning) MetaPlus ® formulation, while fostering the goal of healthier everyday refreshment by being as natural as possible without the artificial preservatives often found in many energy drinks and sodas. Celsius ® has no artificial preservatives, aspartame or high fructose corn syrup and is very low in sodium. Celsius ® uses good-for-you ingredients and supplements such as green tea (EGCG), ginger, calcium, chromium, B vitamins and vitamin C. The main Celsius ® line of products is sweetened with sucralose, a sugar-derived sweetener that is found in Splenda ®, which makes our beverages low-calorie and suitable for consumers whose sugar intake is restricted. We have undertaken significant marketing efforts aimed at building brand awareness, including a wide variety of marketing vehicles such as television, radio, digital, social media, sponsorships, and magazine advertising. We also undertake various promotions at the retail level such as coupons and other discounts in addition to in-store sampling. We have entered into agreements with various distributors to sell our products domestically and abroad, particularly in Sweden and the Far East. We do not directly manufacture our beverages, but instead outsource the manufacturing process to established third-party co-packers. We do, however, provide our co-packers with flavors, ingredient blends, cans and other raw materials for our beverages purchased by us from various suppliers. 1 Recent Developments September 2019 Public Offering On September 16, 2019, the Company consummated a public offering of an aggregate of 7,986,110 shares, of its common stock at a public offering price of $3.60, which included the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase an additional 1,041,666 shares.

The Company received net proceeds from the offering of approximately $26.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds of the offering to fund the cash needed to consummate the acquisition of Func Food Group Oyj and related fees, costs and expenses as described below. The remaining net proceeds of the offering are being used for general corporate purposes, including funding marketing initiatives and expanding European distribution of Celsius products. Debt Conversion Celsius entered into Convertible Loan Agreements (the “Loan Agreements”) with Charmnew Limited (“Charmnew”) and Grieg International Limited (“Grieg”) on December 12, 2018, and with CD Financial, LLC (“CD Financial”), an affiliate of a principal shareholder of the Company on December 14, 2018, providing for aggregate loans to the Company in principal amounts of $3,000,000, $2,000,000 and $5,000,000, respectively. In connection with the Loan Agreements, the Company executed and delivered Convertible Promissory Notes (the “Notes”) in favor of each of Charmnew, Grieg and CD Financial. The Notes had a maturity date of the second anniversary after issuance and bore interest at the rate of 5% per annum payable semi-annually. Upon consummation of our September 2019 public offering, the principal amount of and all accrued but unpaid interest on the Notes held by Charmnew, Grieg and CD Financial converted, in accordance with their terms, into 1,022,568, 681,712 and 1,492,180 shares of our common stock, at a conversion price of $3.04, $3.04 and $3.39, respectively. Acquisition of Func Food Group Oyj Effective October 25, 2019, the Company completed a financial restructuring and acquisition of Func Food Group Oyj, a Finnish corporation (“Func Food”). Pursuant to a series of agreements entered into effective September 11, 2019 (the “Acquisition Agreements”) with the shareholders, bondholders and certain other lenders of Func Food, Func Food’s outstanding debt of approximately $55,000,000, certain of which was in default, was restructured and Celsius acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Func Food. Func Food is a Finland based wellness company that markets and distributes beverages, protein bars, supplements and superfoods in Finland, Sweden, and Norway. Celsius has had a distribution arrangement with Func Food since 2016, when Func Food commenced distribution of Celsius products in Sweden (where they have become the best-selling fitness drink). Func Food subsequently expanded distribution of our products to Finland in 2016 and Norway in 2018. In addition to Celsius’ products, Func Food also distributes products under the brands FAST, FitFarm and CocoVi. The FAST, FitFarm and CocoVi brands and associated products are owned by Func Food. FAST products is a market leader in Finland and has begun distribution into the Swedish market. FitFarm and CocoVi are well-established brands of superfoods and other supplements in the Nordic countries. 2 Prior to closing of the acquisition, Func Food had the following outstanding debt: Pursuant to the Acquisition Agreements, at closing the Outstanding Bonds were restructured into two new classes of bonds as follows: The Reinstated Bonds and the Buyer Bonds constitute direct, unconditional, unsubordinated and secured obligations of Func Food and are guaranteed by all of Func Food’s subsidiaries. Celsius may, in its own discretion choose to repay up to 50% of the principal amount of the Reinstated Bonds at maturity by way of newly-issued shares of its common stock, at price per share equal to the lower of (i) 110% of the 30 day volume weighted average closing price for our shares at closing; and (ii) €3.50. The Reinstated Bonds may be redeemed in full (but not in part) at Func Food’s option at any time prior to maturity at a redemption premium of 103% of the principal amount. In addition, if (a) prior to maturity of the Reinstated Bonds, Func Food’s FAST business is sold; or (b) on or after January 1, 2020, Celsius consummates a subsequent equity capital raise, the net proceeds from such transactions, to the fullest extent possible, shall be applied to redemption of the Reinstated Bonds. 3 The Reinstated Bonds and the Buyer Bonds have customary affirmative and negative covenants applicable to Fund Food, including restrictions on distributions, pledging assets and incurring additional indebtedness, meeting quarterly liquidity and other financial compliance tests, providing periodic financial reports and requiring bondholder consent to amendments and waivers. At closing of the acquisition, $932,960 of the Reinstated Bonds were allocated to Sentica in exchange for the Sentica Loans, $93,520 of the Reinstated Bonds were allocated to members of Func Food management as part of their retention bonus and the balance was allocated to the holders of the Outstanding Bonds. At closing, Celsius acquired the Jutta Loans, Joy Loan and Vendor Loan for an aggregate of $672,000 and all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Func Food from Sentica and the other shareholders for nominal consideration of $1.12. Celsius reimbursed other parties to the acquisition approximately $580,000 in legal and advisory fees. Corporate History We were incorporated in Nevada on April 26, 2005 under the name “Vector Ventures, Inc.” and originally engaged in mineral exploration. Such business was unsuccessful. On January 26, 2007, we acquired the Celsius ® beverage business of Elite FX, Inc., a Florida corporation engaged in the development of “functional” beverages since 2004 in a reverse merger, and subsequently changed our name to Celsius Holdings, Inc. We currently have one Florida subsidiary, Celsius Netshipments, Inc., established in 2007, one Nevada subsidiary, Celsius, Inc., established in 2007, two Hong Kong corporate subsidiaries, Celsius Asia Holdings Limited and Celsius China Holdings Limited, established in 2018 and a Chinese corporate subsidiary, Celsius (Beijing) Beverage Co. Limited, also established in 2018. Our Products Celsius ® calorie-burning beverages were first introduced to the marketplace in 2005. According to multiple clinical studies we funded, a single serving (12 ounce can) of Celsius ® burns 100 to 140 calories by increasing a consumer’s metabolism an average of 12% for up to a three-hour period. In addition, these studies have indicated that drinking a single serving of Celsius ® prior to exercising may improve cardiovascular health and fitness and enhance the loss of fat and gain of muscle from exercise. We seek to combine nutritional science with mainstream beverages by using our proprietary thermogenic (calorie-burning) MetaPlus ® formulation, while fostering the goal of healthier everyday refreshment by being as natural as possible without the artificial preservatives often found in many energy drinks or sodas. Celsius ® has no chemical preservatives, aspartame or high fructose corn syrup and is very low in sodium. Celsius ® uses good-for-you ingredients and supplements such as green tea (EGCG), ginger, calcium, chromium, B vitamins and vitamin C. Celsius is sweetened with sucralose, a sugar-derived sweetener that is found in Splenda ® , which makes our beverages low-calorie and suitable for consumers whose sugar intake is restricted. Each 12 ounce can of Celsius ® contains 200 milligrams of caffeine which is comparable to one 12-ounce cup of coffee from the leading coffeehouse. 4 Our original Celsius® product line is currently offered in nine flavors: orange, wild berry, cola, grape, kiwi-guava and watermelon (which are carbonated), and non-carbonated green tea raspberry/acai, green tea/peach mango green tea/grapefruit melon (introduced during 2019). Celsius® is packaged in a distinctive 12 ounce sleek can that uses vivid colors in abstract patterns to create a strong on-shelf impact. The cans are sold as singles or in four-packs. We have recently redesigned our packaging to provide a cleaner, crisper and more modern look. We also sell a powdered form of the active ingredients in our beverages in individual On-The-Go packets as well as multiple serving canisters. In addition to being sugar free, our original ready-to -drink product line is non-GMO, kosher and vegan certified and soy and gluten free. In 2018, Celsius introduced its first product line extension focused on broadening the reach of Celsius® into the natural channel. The natural line extension is available in refreshing flavors: three sparkling - grapefruit, cucumber lime, orange pomegranate and three non-carbonated - pineapple coconut, watermelon berry and strawberries & cream. The natural line extension boasts a clean ingredient panel featuring 100% natural caffeine-from-green-coffee bean extract, and an all-natural sweetener. Like the original Celsius® products, our new natural ready-to -drink beverages are non-GMO, kosher and vegan certified and soy and gluten free. During 2018, we also introduced the second line in our product portfolio, trainer’s grade Celsius Heat™. Celsius Heat™ is also a dietary supplement, that uses the same proprietary thermogenic MetaPlus® formula as Celsius®, which is proven to accelerate metabolism, boost energy and accelerate calorie and fat burn when combined with exercise. Celsius Heat™, which is packed with 2,000mg of L-citrulline and 300mg of caffeine, comes in eight carbonated flavors: Apple Jack’d, Orangesicle, Inferno Punch, Cherry Lime, Blueberry Pomegranate, Strawberry Dragonfruit, Tangerine Grapefruit and Jackfruit. In August 2019, we announced a further expansion to our product line in an innovative branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) functional beverage that fuels muscle recovery. The BCAA product line was initially launched in the fitness channel. We target a niche in the functional beverage segment of the beverage industry consisting of consumers seeking calorie-burning beverages to help them manage their weight and enhance their exercise regimen. Our target consumers are generally individuals that exercise two to five times a week and are concerned about their health. As a result of completion of the acquisition of Func Food in October 2019, we acquired the beverages, protein bars, supplements and superfoods marketed and distributed in Finland, Sweden, and Norway. These products are distributed under the FAST, FitFarm and CocoVi brands and which are owned by Func Food. FAST products is a market leader in Finland and has begun distribution into the Swedish market. FitFarm and CocoVi are well-established brands of superfoods and other supplements in the Nordic countries. 5 Clinical Studies It is our belief that clinical studies substantiating product claims will become more important as more and more beverages are marketed with health claims. Celsius ® was one of the first functional beverages to be launched along with a clinical study. Celsius ® is also one of very few functional beverages that has clinical research on the actual product itself. Some beverage companies that do mention studies backing their claims are referencing independent studies conducted on one or more of the ingredients in the product. We believe that it is important and will become more important to have studies on the actual product. We have funded seven U.S. based clinical studies for Celsius ® . Each was conducted by a research organization and each studied the total Celsius ® formula. The first study was conducted by the Ohio Research Group of Exercise Science & Sports Nutrition. The remaining studies were conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of the University of Oklahoma. We funded all of the studies and provided Celsius® beverage for the studies. However, none of our directors, executive officers or principal shareholders is in any way affiliated with either of the two research organizations which conducted the studies. The first study was conducted in 2005 by the Ohio Research Group of Exercise Science & Sports Nutrition www.ohioresearchgroup.com . The Ohio Research Group of Exercise Science & Sports Nutrition is a multidisciplinary clinical research team dedicated to exploring the relationship between exercise, nutrition, dietary supplements and health. This placebo-controlled, double-blind cross-over study compared the effects of Celsius ® and the placebo on metabolic rate. Twenty-two participants were randomly assigned to ingest a 12 ounce serving of Celsius ® and on a separate day a serving of twelve ounces of Diet Coke ® . All subjects completed both trials using a randomized, counterbalanced design. Randomized means that subjects were selected for each group randomly to ensure that the different treatments were statistically equivalent. Counterbalancing means that individuals in one group drank the placebo on the first day and drank Celsius ® on the second day. The other group did the opposite. Counterbalancing is a design method that is used to control “order effects.” In other words, this was done to make sure that the order that subjects were served does not impact the results and analysis. Metabolic rate (via indirect calorimetry, measurements taken from breaths into and out of calorimeter) and substrate oxidation (via respiratory exchange ratios) were measured at baseline (pre-ingestion) and for ten minutes at the end of each hour for three hours post-ingestion. The results showed an average increase of metabolism of twelve percent over the three-hour period, compared to a statistically insignificant change for the control group. Metabolic rate, or metabolism, is the rate at which the body expends energy. This is also referred to as the “caloric burn rate.” Indirect calorimetry calculates heat that living organisms produce from their production of carbon dioxide. It is called “indirect” because the caloric burn rate is calculated from a measurement of oxygen uptake. Direct calorimetry would involve the subject being placed inside the calorimeter for the measurement to determine the heat being produced. Respiratory Exchange Ratio is the ratio oxygen taken in a breath compared to the carbon dioxide breathed out in one breath or exchange. Measuring this ratio can be used for estimating which substrate (fuel such as carbohydrate or fat) is being metabolized or ‘oxidized’ to supply the body with energy. The second study was conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2007. This blinded, placebo-controlled study was conducted on a total of 60 men and women of normal weight. An equal number of participants were separated into two groups to compare one serving (a single 12 ounce can) of Celsius ® to a placebo of the same amount. According to the study, those subjects consuming Celsius ® burned significantly more calories versus those consuming the placebo, over a three-hour period. The study confirmed that over the three-hour period, subjects consuming a single serving of Celsius ® burned 65% more calories than those consuming the placebo beverage and burned an average of more than 100 to 140 calories compared to the placebo. These results were statistically significant. The third study, conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2007, extended our second study with the same group of 60 individuals and protocol for 28 days and showed the same statistical significance of increased calorie burn (minimal attenuation). While the University of Oklahoma study did extend for 28 days, more testing would be needed for long term analysis of the Celsius ® calorie-burning effects. Also, although these studies were on relatively small numbers of subjects, they have statistically significant results. Additional studies on a larger number and wider range of body compositions can be considered to further the analysis. Our fourth study, conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2009, combined Celsius ® use with exercise. This ten-week placebo-controlled, randomized and blinded study was conducted on a total of 37 subjects. Participants were randomly assigned into one of two groups: Group 1 consumed one serving of Celsius ® per day, and Group 2 consumed one serving of an identically flavored and labeled placebo beverage. Both groups participated in ten weeks of combined aerobic and weight training, following the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines of training for previously sedentary adults. The results showed that consuming a single serving of Celsius ® prior to exercising may enhance the positive adaptations of exercise on body composition, cardio-respiratory fitness and endurance performance. According to the preliminary findings, subjects consuming a single serving of Celsius ® lost significantly more fat mass and gained significantly more muscle mass than those subjects consuming the placebo — a 93.75% greater loss in fat and 50% greater gain in muscle mass, respectively. The study also confirmed that subjects consuming Celsius® significantly improved measures of cardio-respiratory fitness and the ability to delay the onset of fatigue when exercising to exhaustion. 6 Our fifth study was conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2009. This ten-week placebo-controlled, randomized and blinded study was conducted on a total of 27 previously sedentary overweight and obese female subjects. Participants were randomly assigned into groups that consumed identically tasting treatment beverages with exercise or without exercise. All participants consumed one drink, either placebo or Celsius ® , per day for 10 weeks. The exercise groups participated in ten weeks of combined aerobic and weight training, following the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines of training for previously sedentary adults. No changes were made to their diet. The results showed that consuming a single serving of Celsius ® prior to exercising may improve cardiovascular health and fitness and enhance the positive adaptations of exercise on body composition. According to the preliminary findings, subjects consuming a single serving of Celsius ® lost significantly more fat mass and gained significantly more muscle mass when compared to exercise alone — a 46% greater loss in fat, 27% greater gain in muscle mass, respectively. The study also confirmed that subjects consuming Celsius ® significantly improved measures of cardio-respiratory fitness — 35% greater endurance performance with significant improvements to lipid profiles — total cholesterol decreases of 5 to 13% and bad LDL cholesterol 12 to 18%. Exercise alone had no effect on blood lipid levels. Our sixth study was conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2009. This ten-week placebo-controlled, randomized and blinded study was conducted on a total of 37 previously sedentary male subjects. Participants were randomly assigned into groups that consumed identically tasting treatment beverages with exercise or without exercise. All participants consumed one drink, either placebo or Celsius ® , per day for 10 weeks. The exercise groups participated in ten weeks of combined aerobic and weight training, following the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines of training for previously sedentary adults. No changes were made to their diet. The results showed that consuming a single serving of Celsius ® prior to exercising may improve cardiovascular health and fitness and enhance the positive adaptations of exercise on body composition. Significantly greater decreases in fat mass and percentage body fat and increases in VO 2 were observed in the subjects that consumed Celsius ® before exercise versus those that consumed the placebo before exercise. Mood was not affected. Clinical markers for hepatic, renal, cardiovascular and immune function, as determined by pre-and post-blood work revealed no adverse effects. Our seventh study was conducted by Miami Research Institute in 2010 and demonstrated the efficacy and safety of the powders and the shots. This study allows the Company to make the same structure/function claims as the ready to drink beverages. Manufacture and Supply of Our Products Our beverages are produced by established third party beverage co-packers. A co-packer is a manufacturing plant that provides the service of filling bottles or cans for the brand owner. We believe one benefit of using co-packers is that we do not have to invest in the production facility and can focus our resources on brand development, sales and marketing. It also allows us produce in multiple locations strategically placed throughout the country. We purchase most of the ingredients and all packaging materials. The co-pack facility assembles our products and charges us a fee by the case. The shelf life of Celsius ® is specified as 15 to 18 months. Substantially all of the raw materials used in the preparation, bottling and packaging of our products are purchased by us or by our co-packers in accordance with our specifications. Generally, we obtain the ingredients used in our products from domestic suppliers and some ingredients have several reliable suppliers. The ingredients in Celsius ® include green tea (EGCG), ginger (from the root), caffeine, B vitamins, vitamin C, taurine, guarana, chromium, calcium, glucuronolactone, sucralose, natural flavors and natural colorings. Celsius ® is labeled with a supplements facts panel. We have no major supply contracts with any of our suppliers. We single-source all our ingredients for purchasing efficiency; however, we have identified a second source for our critical ingredients and there are many suppliers of flavors, colorings and sucralose. In case of a supply restriction or interruption from any of the flavor and coloring suppliers, we would have to test and qualify other suppliers that may disrupt our production schedules. Packaging materials, except for our distinctive sleek aluminum cans, are easily available from multiple sources in the United States; however, due to efficiencies we utilize single source vendor relationships. We believe that our co-packing arrangement and supply sources are adequate for our present needs. Func Food similarly has its FAST and other products manufactured by independent third parties in the Nordic countries. Distribution Domestic In the United States and elsewhere in North America, Celsius® is sold across many retail segments. They include supermarkets, convenience stores, drug stores, nutritional stores, and mass merchants. We also sell to health clubs, spas, gyms, the military, and e-commerce websites. 7 We distribute our products domestically through a hybrid of direct-store delivery (DSD) distributors and as well as sales direct to retailers (DTR). International We distribute our products in various foreign regions through regional and country-specific distribution partners. In October 2019, we acquired Func Food, our Nordic distribution partner, who markets both our products as well as other products under its own brands. Celsius intends to use Func Food as a platform to expand product distribution elsewhere in Europe. Beginning in 2018, we focused a significant part of our marketing efforts on expanding our global reach into the Asian market, which is one of the most dynamic and fastest-growing, making it an important target in our pursuit of global growth. Having a diverse, established and expanding product line, we increased our investment in this key market with the launch and expansion of two important relationships and the formation of an experienced, focused regional team. In September 2018, we entered China with our partner, Qifeng Food Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd. (“Qifeng”). We began both local production and initial distribution of the Celsius® brand. The initial distribution covered select channels across three Tier-1 cities - Beijing, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, as well as in over 30 other cities across 14 provinces. Consumer response was overwhelmingly positive and signals that our plan for broader product distribution in China is in-line with market opportunities. At the same time, we are also accelerated our distribution in Hong Kong through our partnership with A.S. Watson Industries. We believe that the foundation of our business in Asia is with strong, capable partners, and we are committed to building on our success to further grow our brand and increase placements of our products. Effective January 1, 2019, we restructured our China distribution efforts by entering into a license and repayment of investment agreement with Qifeng, thereby creating a risk-mitigated method of capturing market share in China. Under the agreement, Qifeng was granted the exclusive license rights to manufacture, market and commercialize Celsius® brand products in China. Qifeng will pay a fixed royalty fee of $6.9 million for the five years of the term of the agreement, transitioning to a volume-based royalty fee, thereafter. In addition, Qifeng Food will repay all capital Celsius has invested into the China market through 2018, over the same five-year period. The first installment of the note from Qifeng was due on March 31, 2020. We were recently requested by Qifeng to provide a three-month extension of the due date for the first installment until June 30, 2019, due to the impact of the health crisis in China. In consideration of the extension, a guarantee was obtained for the full amount of the first-installment and the installment was collateralized by a pledge of 570,412 of our common shares held. Accordingly, Celsius granted the extension and as a result, payment in full of the first installment is expected to be made on or before paid on June 30, 2020. In October 2019, we acquired Func Food, which distributed Celsius products (as well as its own branded products) in the Nordic countries. Celsius intends to use Func Food as a platform to expand product distribution elsewhere in Europe. 8 Seasonality of Sales As is typical in the beverage industry, sales of our beverages are seasonal, with the highest sales volumes generally occurring in the second and third fiscal quarters, which correspond to the warmer months of the year in our major markets. Competition We believe that our Celsius® brand products are one of the few calorie-burning fitness beverages whose effectiveness is supported by clinical studies, which gives us a unique position in the beverage market. However, our products do compete broadly with all categories of consumer beverages. The beverage market is highly competitive, and includes international, national, regional and local producers and distributors, most of whom have greater financial, management and other resources than us. Our direct competitors in the functional beverage market include, but are not limited to The Coca-Cola Company, Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, PepsiCo, Inc., Nestlé, Waters North America, Inc., Hansen Natural Corp., Monster Energy, and Red Bull. Proprietary Rights We have registered the Celsius ® and MetaPlus ® trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, as well as a number of additional trademarks. We have and will continue to take appropriate measures, such as entering into confidentiality agreements with our contract packers and ingredient suppliers, to maintain the secrecy and proprietary nature of our MetaPlus ® formulation and product formulas. We maintain our MetaPlus ® formulation and product formulas as trade secrets. We believe that trade secrecy is a preferable method of protection for our formulas as patenting them might require their disclosure. Other than a company that is our outsourced production manager, no single member of the raw material supply chain or our co-packers has access to the complete formula. We consider our trademarks and trade secrets to be of considerable value and importance to our business. No successful challenges to our registered trademarks have arisen and we have no reason to believe that any such challenges will arise in the future. As a result of the acquisition of Func Food in October 2019, we have acquired additional brands and tradenames. Government Regulation The production, distribution and sale of our products in the United States is subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act , the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 , the Occupational Safety and Health Act , various environmental statutes and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products. California law requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a component listed by California as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects. The law exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products because the law recognizes no generally applicable quantitative thresholds below which a warning is not required. Consequently, even trace amounts of listed components can expose affected products to the prospect of warning labels. Products containing listed substances that occur naturally in the product or that are contributed to the product solely by a municipal water supply are generally exempt from the warning requirement. While none of our products are required to display warnings under this law, we cannot predict whether an important component of any of our products might be added to the California list in the future. We also are unable to predict whether or to what extent a warning under this law would have an impact on costs or sales of our products. 9 Measures have been enacted in various localities and states that require that a deposit be charged for certain non-refillable beverage containers. The precise requirements imposed by these measures vary. Other deposit, recycling or product stewardship proposals have been introduced in certain states and localities and in Congress, and we anticipate that similar legislation or regulations may be proposed in the future at the local, state and federal levels, both in the United States and elsewhere. Our facilities in the United States are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Compliance with these provisions has not had, and we do not expect such compliance to have, any material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations. The marketing and sale of our products internationally is similarly subject to compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations in those foreign countries where our products are sold. Employees As of the date of this Report, the Company employs 120 people, including its executive officers. Item 1A. Risk Factors Our business faces certain risks. The risks described below may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently think as immaterial, may also impair our business. If any of the events anticipated by the risks described below or elsewhere in this report occur, our results of operations and financial conditions could be adversely affected. Risk Factors Relating to Our Business We have a history of losses and we may experience additional losses in the futures. Although the Company generated net income available to common shareholder of $9,971,260, for the year ended December 31, 2019, there has been a history of losses, including net losses available to common shareholders of $11,419,781 for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our future operating results will depend on many factors, both in and out of our control, including the ability to increase and sustain demand for and acceptance of our products, the level of our competition, and our ability to attract and maintain key management and key employees. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we can attain consistent profitability. We rely on third party co-packers to manufacture our products. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our co-packers and/or their ability to manufacture our products becomes constrained or unavailable to us, our business could suffer. We do not directly manufacture our products, but instead outsource such manufacturing to established third party co-packers. These third-party co-packers may not be able to fulfill our demand as it arises, could begin to charge rates that make using their services cost inefficient or may simply not be able to or willing to provide their services to us on a timely basis or at all. In the event of any disruption or delay, whether caused by a rift in our relationship or the inability of our co-packers to manufacture our products as required, we would need to secure the services of alternative co-packers. We may be unable to procure alternative packing facilities at commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time period and any such transition could be costly. In such case, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. We rely on distributors to distribute our products in the DSD sales channel and in international markets. If we are unable to secure such distributors and/or we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing distributors, our business could suffer. We distribute Celsius ® in the DSD sales channel by entering into agreements with direct-to-store delivery distributors having established sales, marketing and distribution organizations. We similarly are seeking to expand our international distribution, particularly in the Far East and elsewhere in Asia by entering into agreements with large established distributors who service those markets. Many of our distributors are affiliated with and manufacture and/or distribute other beverage products. In many cases, such products compete directly with our products. The marketing efforts of our distributors are important for our success. If Celsius ® proves to be less attractive to our distributors and/or if we fail to attract distributors, and/or our distributors do not market and promote our products with greater focus in preference to the products of our competitors, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. 10 Our customers are material to our success. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing customers, our business could suffer. Unilateral decisions could be taken by our distributors, grocery chains, convenience chains, drug stores, nutrition stores, mass merchants, club warehouses and other customers to discontinue carrying all or any of our products that they are carrying at any time, which could cause our business to suffer. Increases in cost or shortages of raw materials or increases in costs of co-packing could harm our business . The principal raw materials used by us are flavors and ingredient blends as well as aluminum cans, the prices of which are subject to fluctuations. We are uncertain whether the prices of any of the above or any other raw materials or ingredients we utilize will rise in the future and whether we will be able to pass any of such increases on to our customers. We do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials. In addition, some of these raw materials, such as our distinctive sleek 12 ounce can, are available from a single or a limited number of suppliers. As alternative sources of supply may not be available, any interruption in the supply of such raw materials might materially harm us. Our failure to accurately estimate demand for our products could adversely affect our business and financial results. We may not correctly estimate demand for our products. If we materially underestimate demand for our products and are unable to secure sufficient ingredients or raw materials, we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis, in which case our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We depend upon our trademarks and proprietary rights, and any failure to protect our intellectual property rights or any claims that we are infringing upon the rights of others may adversely affect our competitive position. Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to protect our current and future brands and products and to defend our intellectual property rights. We cannot be sure that trademarks will be issued with respect to any future trademark applications or that our competitors will not challenge, invalidate or circumvent any existing or future trademarks issued to, or licensed by, us. Our products are manufactured using our proprietary blends of ingredients. These blends are created by third-party suppliers to our specifications and then supplied to our co-packers. Although all of the third parties in our supply and manufacture chain execute confidentiality agreements, there can be no assurance that our trade secrets, including our proprietary ingredient blends will not become known to competitors. We believe that our competitors, many of whom are more established and have greater financial and personnel resources than we do, may be able to replicate or reverse engineer our processes, brands, flavors, or our products in a manner that could circumvent our protective safeguards. Therefore, we cannot give you any assurance that our confidential business information will remain proprietary. Any such loss of confidentiality could diminish or eliminate any competitive advantage provided by our proprietary information. We may incur material losses as a result of product recall and product liability . We may be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury, illness or death. We also may be required to recall some of our products if they become contaminated or are damaged or mislabeled. A significant product liability judgment against us, or a widespread product recall, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The amount of the insurance we carry is limited, and that insurance is subject to certain exclusions and may or may not be adequate. Our lack of product diversification and inability to timely introduce new or alternative products could cause us to cease operations. Our business is centered on Celsius ® and our recent product line extensions, including Celsius Heat™. The risks associated with focusing on a limited product line are substantial. If consumers do not accept our products or if there is a general decline in market demand for, or any significant decrease in, the consumption of functional beverages, we are not financially or operationally capable of introducing alternative products within a short time frame. As a result, such lack of acceptance or market demand decline could cause us to cease operations. 11 We are dependent on our key executives and employees and the loss of any of their services could materially adversely affect us which may have a material adverse effect on our Company. Our future success will depend substantially upon the abilities of, and personal relationships developed by our key executives and employees. The sudden loss of the services of any key executive or employee could materially adversely affect our business and our prospects for the future. We do not have key person insurance on the lives of such individuals. We are dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified technical, sales and managerial personnel . Our future success depends in part on our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical, sales and managerial personnel. Competition for such personnel in the beverage industry is intense and we may not be able to retain our key managerial, sales and technical employees or attract and retain additional highly qualified technical, sales and managerial personnel in the future. Any inability to attract and retain the necessary technical, sales and managerial personnel could materially adversely affect us. The FDA has not passed on the efficacy of our products or the accuracy of any claim we make related to our products. Although six independent clinical studies have been conducted relating to the calorie-burning and related effects of our products, the results of these studies have not been submitted to or reviewed by the FDA. Further, the FDA has not passed on the efficacy of any of our products nor has it reviewed or passed on any claims we make related to our products, including the claim that our products aid consumers in burning calories or enhancing their metabolism. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by natural catastrophes or public health crises, in the locations in which we, our distributors or our suppliers operate. A natural disaster could disrupt our operations, or our distributors’ or suppliers’ operations and delivery of products and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, our international operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, which could harm our business and cause our operating results to suffer. For example, since December 2019, an outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus in Wuhan, China and elsewhere (including Europe) has resulted in travel disruption and has affected certain companies’ operations. At this point, the extent to which the coronavirus may impact our results is uncertain. However, since we operate on a fixed royalty basis in China we do not currently expect the coronavirus to have a material adverse effect on results of operations and financial condition. Risk Factors Relating to Our Industry We are subject to significant competition in the beverage industry . The beverage industry is highly competitive. The principal areas of competition are pricing, packaging, distribution channel penetration, development of new products and flavors and marketing campaigns. Our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of manufacturers, most of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution resources and name recognition than we do. Important factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include the taste and flavor of our products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective development of new, unique cutting-edge products, attractive and different packaging, branded product advertising and pricing. Our products compete with all liquid refreshments and with products of much larger and substantially better financed competitors, including the products of numerous nationally and internationally known producers, such as The Coca Cola Company, Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, PepsiCo, Inc., Nestle, Waters North America, Inc., Hansen Natural Corp. and Red Bull. We also compete with companies that are smaller or primarily local in operation. Our products also compete with private label brands such as those carried by supermarket chains, convenience store chains, drug store chains, mass merchants and club warehouses. There can be no assurance that we will compete successfully in the functional beverage industry. The failure to do so would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 12 We compete in an industry that is brand-conscious, so brand name recognition and acceptance of our products are critical to our success and significant marketing and advertising could be needed to achieve and sustain brand recognition. Our business is substantially dependent upon awareness and market acceptance of our products and brands by our targeted consumers. Our business depends on acceptance by our independent distributors of our brand as one that has the potential to provide incremental sales growth rather than reduce distributors’ existing beverage sales. The development of brand awareness and market acceptance is likely to require significant marketing and advertising expenditures. There can be no assurance that Celsius ® will achieve and maintain satisfactory levels of acceptance by independent distributors and retail consumers. Any failure of the Celsius ® brand to maintain or increase acceptance or market penetration would likely have a material adverse effect on business, financial condition and results of operations. Our sales are affected by seasonality. As is typical in the beverage industry, our sales are seasonal. Our highest sales volumes generally occur in the second and third quarters, which correspond to the warmer months of the year in our major markets. Consumer demand for our products is also affected by weather conditions. Cool, wet spring or summer weather could result in decreased sales of our beverages and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Our business is subject to many regulations and noncompliance is costly . The production, marketing and sale of our beverage products are subject to the rules and regulations of various federal, state and local health agencies. The marketing and sale of our products internationally is similarly subject to compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations in those foreign countries where our products are sold. If a regulatory authority finds that a current or future product or production run is not in compliance with any of these regulations, we may be fined, or production may be stopped, thus adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, any adverse publicity associated with any noncompliance may damage our reputation and our ability to successfully market our products. Furthermore, the rules and regulations are subject to change from time to time and while we closely monitor developments in this area, we have no way of anticipating whether changes in these rules and regulations will impact our business adversely. Additional or revised regulatory requirements, whether labeling, environmental, tax or otherwise, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks related to our recent acquisition of Func Food may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any acquisition, including the recently completed acquisition of Func Food, involves potential risks, including, among other things: If any of these risks were to materialize, the benefits of the Func Food acquisition may not be fully realized, if at all, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted. 13 Risk Factors Relating to our Status as a Fully Reporting Public Company We are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) that require us to incur audit fees and legal fees in connection with the preparation of such reports. These additional costs could reduce or eliminate our ability to earn a profit. We are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and as a result, we are now required to file periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) pursuant to the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. In order to comply with these requirements, our independent registered public accounting firm has to review our financial statements on a quarterly basis and audit our financial statements on an annual basis. Moreover, our legal counsel has to review and assist in the preparation of such reports. The costs charged by these professionals for such services cannot be accurately predicted at this time because factors such as the number and type of transactions that we engage in and the complexity of our reports cannot be determined at this time and will have a major effect on the amount of time to be spent by our auditors and attorneys. However, the incurrence of such costs will obviously be an expense to our operations and thus have a negative effect on our ability to meet our overhead requirements and earn a profit. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our common stock, if a market ever develops, could drop significantly. If we do not maintain an effective internal control environment as well as adequate control procedures over our financial reporting, investor confidence may be adversely affected thereby affecting the value of our stock price We are required to maintain proper internal control over our financial reporting and adequate controls related to our disclosures. As defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. If we fail to maintain adequate controls, our business, the results of operations, financial condition and/or the value of our stock may be adversely impacted. Risk Factors Related to our Common Stock We cannot guarantee the continued existence of an active established public trading market for our common stock. Our common stock currently is listed for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Trading in stock quoted on the Nasdaq Capital Market may often experience wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance. 14 Market prices for our common stock may also be influenced by a number of other factors, including: Our board of directors has the authority, without shareholder approval, to issue preferred stock with terms that may not be beneficial to common shareholders and with the ability to affect adversely shareholder voting power and perpetuate their control over us. Our Articles of Incorporation allows our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without any vote or further action by our shareholders. Our board of directors has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock. As a result, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation, the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock and the right to the redemption of the shares, together with a premium, prior to the redemption of our common stock. The ability of our principal shareholders to control our business may limit or eliminate minority shareholders’ ability to influence corporate affairs. Our principal shareholders own common stock and/or preferred stock which holds a majority of the voting power of our issued and outstanding capital. Accordingly, they will be able to effectively control the election of directors, as well as all other matters requiring shareholder approval. The interests of our principal shareholders may differ from the interests of other shareholders with respect to the issuance of shares, business transactions with or sales to other companies, selection of other directors and other business decisions. The minority shareholders have no way of overriding decisions made by our principal shareholders. This level of control may also have an adverse impact on the market value of our shares because our principal shareholders may institute or undertake transactions, policies or programs that result in losses, may not take any steps to increase our visibility in the financial community and / or may sell sufficient numbers of shares to significantly decrease our price per share. We do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future . We have never paid cash dividends on our common stock. We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock at any time in the foreseeable future. The future payment of dividends directly depends upon our future earnings, capital requirements, financial requirements and other factors that our board of directors will consider. Since we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock, return on your investment, if any, will depend solely on an increase, if any, in the market value of our common stock. 15 Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. Not applicable to the Company because we are a “ smaller reporting company .” Item 2. Properties. At present, we do not own any real property. We currently lease our principal executive offices located at 2424 N Federal Highway, Boca Raton, Florida 33431. Our premises are leased for a monthly cost of $12,826. The current lease expires on October 2020. The Company has no warehouses or other facilities as we store our product at third party contract warehouse facilities. We also now have leased premises in Europe which have an aggregate monthly cost of approximately $9,500. These leases have different periods and extend until January 2022. Item 3. Legal Proceedings. As previously reported, on December 18, 2018, Rockstar, Inc. (“Rockstar”) filed suit against Celsius in federal district court in the District of Nevada. Rockstar’s complaint alleged three claims for relief: (a) false advertising in violation of 15 USC §1125(a); (b) violation of the Nevada Deceptive Trade Practice Act; and (c) Nevada common law unfair competition. On January 16, 2020 the parties entered into a non-monetary settlement of this litigation. On April 8, 2019, Daniel Prescod filed suit against Celsius in the Superior Court for the State of California, County of Los Angeles (the “ Prescod Litigation ”). Daniel Prescod asserts that the Company’s use of citric acid in its products while simultaneously claiming “no preservatives” violates California Consumer Legal Remedies Act, California Business and Professions Code Section 17200, et seq., and California Business and Professions Code Section 17500, et seq., because citric acid acts as a preservative. The Company does not use citric acid as a preservative in its products, but rather as a flavoring, and therefore it believes that its “no preservatives” claim is fair and not deceptive. The Company intends to contest the claims vigorously. Since this matter is still in its initial stages, the Company is unable to predict the outcome at this time. On January 24, 2020, Evlution Nutrition, LLC filed suit against Celsius in federal court for the Southern District of Florida, for trademark infringement (the “Evlution Litigation”). Evlution asserts that Celsius’ BCAA dietary supplement product’s use of BCAA + ENERGY infringes upon Evlution’s registered trademarks. The Company believes that Evlution’s trademarks are invalid, merely descriptive, and unenforceable and Celsius has filed a cancellation proceeding regarding those trademarks with the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board of the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The Company intends to defend against Evlution’s claims vigorously. Since this matter is still in its initial stages, the Company is unable to predict the outcome at this time. In addition to the foregoing, from time to time, we may become party to litigation or other legal proceedings that we consider to be a part of the ordinary course of our business. Item 4.

This Item 7 contains forward-looking statements. The matters discussed in these forward-looking statements are subject to risk, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those made, projected or implied in the forward-looking statements. Please refer to “ Item 1A. Risk Factors ” for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. Results of Operations Results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019, include the operations for Func Food as of the date of acquisition on October 25, 2019. Year ended December 31, 2019 compared to year ended December 31, 2018 Revenue For the year ended December 31, 2019, revenue was approximately $75.1 million, an increase of $22.5 million or 43% from $52.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This revenue growth in 2019 was mainly associated with the results of the North American region which delivered an increase of $20.8 million over last year or 53% increase from 2018. The European region provided $14.5 million, an increase of $5.2 million or 56% from $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Asian revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 reflect the change in our China business model from a distribution model to a royalty and license fee arrangement, effective January 1, 2019. Accordingly, Asian revenue for 2019 related to product sales was $492,000 and Asian revenue for 2019 related to royalties contributed an additional $349,000. Revenues from all other regions in 2019 was $191,000 a 4% increase from $183,000 in 2018. The total increase in revenues from the 2018 period to the 2019 period was primarily attributable to an increase in sales volume, as opposed to increases in product pricing. The following table sets forth the amount of revenues by category and changes therein for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018: 18 Gross profit For the year ended December 31, 2019, gross profit increased by approximately $10.2 million or 49% to $31.3 million from $21.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Gross profit margins totaled 42% and 40% in the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The increase in gross margin profitability is mainly related to reductions in product repackaging costs, freight costs and favorable impact of the consolidation of the European business as a result of the acquisition of Func Food. The increase in gross profit dollars from 2018 to 2019 is primarily attributable to the increases in revenue. Sales and marketing expenses Sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019, were approximately $21.1 million, a decrease of approximately $100,000 or .5% from $21.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease is due primarily to the change in our China business model from a distribution model to a royalty and licensing framework effective January 1, 2019, which no longer requires direct marketing investments by Celsius. Excluding the impact of the reduction in sales and marketing expenses related to the China investment which amounted to $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, our investment in marketing initiatives increased by $1.3 million or 20% from 2018. These figures now include the marketing investments that are performed in our European business as of October 25, 2019. Moreover, our support to distributors and investments in trade activities were $2.3 million higher for the year ended December 31, 2019 than for the same period last year, to support our expanded distribution network. Additionally, investments related to sales and marketing personnel costs which now include the European business as of the date of the acquisition, were $1.7 million higher for the year ended December 31, 2019 than for the same period last year. Furthermore, broker commissions and storage & distribution costs were $1.8 million higher in 2019, as compared to 2018, reflecting the increase in our business volume and the integration of Func Food’s European operations following completion of the acquisition. General and administrative expenses General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 were approximately $11.6 million, an increase of $1.1 million, or 11%, from $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. However, the prior year figures included $1.0 million pertaining to a legal settlement with a former distributor. Therefore, the increase in general and administrative expenses excluding this prior year impact amounts to $2.1 million. This increase was primarily due to higher stock-based compensation of $540,000 and $580,000 of acquisition related costs. Additionally, there were incremental expenses of $452,000 pertaining to employee costs, $250,000 pertaining to higher professional services, $150,000 of depreciation & amortization and $130,000 pertaining to other administrative costs, as these expenses also included the impact of the integration of Func Food’s European operations after the acquisition. Other Income/(expense) Total other income increased by approximately $11.9 million for year ended December 31, 2019 to $11.4 million from a loss of $565,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily as a result of the recognition of a gain pertaining to the restructuring agreement entered into with our Chinese distributor effective January 1, 2019, which, in addition to changing our business model from a distribution to a license and royalty arrangement, provided for the repayment of the investment the Company made in the China market during 2017 and 2018 over a five-year period, on an unsecured, interest-bearing basis. This has been recorded as a corresponding note receivable from our Chinese distributor on our balance sheet at December 31, 2019. Net Income/Loss As a result of all the above, for the year ended December 31, 2019, net income to common shareholders was approximately $10.0 million, or $0.16 per basic share based on a weighted average of 60,761,995 shares outstanding and after adding back interest expense on convertible notes of $348,493 and amortization of discount on notes payable of $239,570, a dilutive net income available to common shareholders of $10.6 million or $0.16 per share, based on a weighted average of 64,183,399 shares outstanding which includes the dilutive impact of the stock options of 1,153,231 shares and the dilutive effect of the convertible notes of 2,268,173 shares. In comparison, for the year ended December 30, 2018 we had net loss of approximately $11.2 million, and after giving effect to preferred stock dividends of approximately $213,133, a net loss available to common shareholders of $11.4 million or a loss of $0.23 per basic and diluted shares, based on a weighted average of 50,050,696 shares outstanding. 19 Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, we had cash of approximately $23.1 million and $7.7 million, respectively and working capital of approximately $24.8 million and $19.6 million, respectively. Cash provided by operations during the year ended December 31, 2019, totaled approximately $1.0 million reflecting the net adjusted economic profitability from operations of $3.7 million and an increase in accounts payable of $2.6 million which was partially offset by increases in accounts receivable, inventories, pre-paid expenses as well as decrease in other liabilities for a total use of cash in these areas of $5.3 million. Cash used in operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $11.6 million mainly related to increases in inventories on hand, pre-paid expenses, investments in sales and marketing programs as well as human resources initiatives. In addition to cash flow from operations, our primary sources of working capital in recent years have been private placements of our securities and our credit facilities with CD Financial, LLC (“ CD Financial ”), an affiliate of Carl DeSantis, a principal shareholder of the Company, as well as Charmnew Limited (“ Charmnew ”) and Grieg International Limited (“ Grieg ”). On September 16, 2019, the Company consummated a public offering of an aggregate of 7,986,110 shares, of its common stock at a public offering price of $3.60, which included the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase an additional 1,041,666 Shares. B. Riley FBR, Inc. acted as lead underwriter for the offering. The Company received net proceeds from the offering of approximately $26.9 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds of the offering to fund the cash needed to consummate the acquisition of Func Food and related fees, costs and expenses. The remaining net proceeds of the offering are being used for general corporate purposes, including funding marketing initiatives and expanding European distribution of Celsius products. Celsius had entered into Convertible Loan Agreements (with Charmnew and Grieg on December 12, 2018, and with CD Financial, on December 14, 2018, providing for aggregate loans to the Company in principal amounts of $3,000,000, $2,000,000 and $5,000,000, respectively. In connection with the Loan Agreements, the Company executed and delivered Convertible Promissory Notes (the “Notes”) in favor of each of Charmnew, Grieg and CD Financial. The Notes had a maturity date of the second anniversary after issuance and bore interest at the rate of 5% per annum payable semi-annually. Upon consummation of our September 2019 public offering, the principal amount of and all accrued but unpaid interest on the Notes held by Charmnew, Grieg and CD Financial converted, in accordance with their terms, into 1,022,568, 681,712 and 1,492,180 shares of our common stock, at a conversion price of $3.04, $3.04 and $3.39, respectively. Our current cash position and operating plan for the next twelve (12) months indicates a sufficient financial condition and we do not contemplate obtaining additional financing. However, if our sales volumes do not meet our projections, expenses exceed our expectations, or our plans change, we may be unable to generate enough cash flow from operations to cover our working capital requirements. In such case, we may be required to adjust our business plan, by reducing marketing and other expenses or seek additional financing. There can be no assurance that such financing, if required, will be available on commercially reasonable terms if at all. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2019, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Not applicable. 20 Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data The financial statements and supplementary data listed in “ Item 15 Financials Statements and Exhibits ” are attached to this Report. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure Not applicable. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. Disclosure controls and procedures Our President and Chief Executive Officer as well as our Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of December 31, 2019, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms adopted by the SEC, including to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial and accounting officer), or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of December 31, 2019, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in that (a) we maintain records that in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (b) our records provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and board of directors; and (c) our records provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. Our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer do not expect that our disclosure controls or internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. Although our disclosure controls and procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our principal executive officer and our Chief Financial Officer have determined that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at doing so, a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented if there exists in an individual a desire to do so. There can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on the framework set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013). Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and financial officers and effected by the Company’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: 21 Management has excluded the acquired business from management’s report on internal control over financial reporting. Based on the evaluation conducted under the above-referenced framework, our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of December 31, 2019, our internal control over financial reporting was effective. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm Effective with the filing of this report, the Company is deemed to be an “ accelerated filer ” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Accordingly, we have included the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm in Item 8 setting forth our registered public accounting firm’s attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Item 308 (b) of Regulation S-K. Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2019, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Celsius Holdings, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2019 and 2018 Business —Celsius Holdings, Inc. (the “ Company ” or “ Celsius Holdings ”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on April 26, 2005. On January 24, 2007, the Company entered into a merger agreement and plan of reorganization with Elite FX, Inc., a Florida corporation. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Elite FX, Inc. was merged into the Company’s subsidiary, Celsius, Inc. and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company on January 26, 2007. In addition, on March 28, 2007 the Company established Celsius Netshipments, Inc. a Florida corporation as two subsidiaries of the Company. On February 7, 2018, the Company established Celsius Asia Holdings Limited a Hong Kong corporation as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. On February 7, 2018 Celsius China Holdings Limited a Hong Kong corporation became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Celsius Asia Holdings Limited and on May 9, 2018, Celsius Asia Holdings Limited established Celsius (Beijing) Beverage Limited, a China corporation as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Celsius Asia Holdings Limited. On September 3, 2019 the Company established Celsius European Holdings B.V. as a wholly- owned subsidiary of the Company. On October 25, 2019, Func Food Group Oyj became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Celsius European Holdings B.V. The Company is engaged in the development, marketing, sale and distribution of “ functional ” calorie-burning fitness beverages under the Celsius® brand name. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”). Consolidation Policy — The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Celsius Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All material inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Significant Estimates — The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts, reserves for inventory obsolescence, the useful lives and values of property, fixtures, equipment and intangible assets, valuation of goodwill, valuation of stock-based compensation, and deferred tax asset valuation allowance. Segment Reporting — Although the Company has a number of operating divisions, separate segment data has not been presented, as they meet the criteria for aggregation as permitted by ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting, (formerly Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 131, Disclosed About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.) F- 8 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2019 and 2018 Concentrations of Risk — Substantially all of the Company’s revenue derives from the sale of Celsius ® beverages. The Company uses single supplier relationships for its raw materials purchases and filling capacity, which potentially subjects the Company to a concentration of business risk. If these suppliers had operational problems or ceased making product available to the Company, operations could be adversely affected. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with high-quality financial institutions. At times, balances in the Company’s cash accounts may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit. At December 31, 2019, the Company had approximately $22.8 million in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had the following 10 percent or greater concentrations of revenue with its customers: At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had the following 10 percent or greater concentrations of accounts receivable with its customers: *Revenues from customer A are derived from a customer located in the United States. Revenues from customer B were derived from a customer located in Sweden which was acquired on October 25, 2019. Please refer to note 10, further details. All other revenues customers were mainly derived from the United States. **Receivables from customer A are obtained from a customer located in the United States. Receivables from customer B were derived from a customer located in Sweden which was acquired on October 25, 2019. Please refer to note 10, further details. Receivables from customer C pertained to a customer in China which now reflects the change in our China business model to a royalty and licensing framework. Cash Equivalents — The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company did not have any investments with maturities of three months or less. Accounts Receivable — Accounts receivable are reported at net realizable value. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors pertaining to the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends, and other information. Delinquent accounts are written-off when it is determined that the amounts are uncollectible. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, there was an allowance for doubtful accounts of $292,400 and $183,000, respectively. F- 9 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2019 and 2018 Inventories — Inventories include only the purchase cost and are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined using the FIFO method. Inventories consist of raw materials and finished products. The Company establishes an inventory reserve to reduce the value of the inventory during the period in which such materials and products are no longer usable or marketable. Specifically, the Company reviews inventory utilization during the past twelve months and also customer orders for subsequent months. If there has been no utilization during the last 12 months and there are no orders in-place in future months which will require the use of inventory item, then inventory item will be included as part of the reserve during the period being evaluated. Management will then specifically evaluate whether these items may be utilized within a reasonable time frame (e.g., 3 to 6 months). In 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded inventory reserves in the amount of $332,000 and $74,650, respectively. The increase in reserve is related to recording European inventories at fair market value. The inventory reserve is included in cost of revenue. Free Samples are recorded as cost of sales. Property and Equipment — Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation of property and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset generally ranging from three to seven years. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets — In accordance with ASC Topics 350 “Goodwill and Other Intangibles” and 360, “Property, Plant, and Equipment” the Company reviews the carrying value of intangibles and other long-lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of long-lived assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the undiscounted cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the property, if any, exceeds its fair value. Goodwill — The Company records goodwill when the consideration paid for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, including related tax effects. Goodwill is not amortized; instead goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if the Company believes indicators of impairment exist. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the Company determines that the fair value is less than the carrying value, the Company will use a two-step process to determine the amount of goodwill impairment. The first step requires comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its net book value, including goodwill. A potential impairment exists if the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its net book value. The second step of the process, performed only if a potential impairment exists, involves determining the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit’s net assets, other than goodwill, and the fair value of the reporting unit. An impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value. For the year ended December 31, 2019, there were no indicators for impairment. On October 25, 2019 the Company acquired 100% of Func Food Group Oyj (“Func Food”) their distributor in the Nordics. As a result of the acquisition goodwill of approximately $10,024,000 resulted from the excess of the consideration paid and the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets (see note 10). There was no other activity related to goodwill during the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018. F- 10 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2019 and 2018 Intangible assets – Intangible assets are comprised of customer relationships and brands acquired in a business combination. The Company amortizes intangible assets with a definitive life over their respective useful lives. Intangibles with indefinite lives are tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if the Company believes indicators of impairment exist. Revenue Recognition — The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers.” The Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied. Product sales occur once control is transferred upon delivery to the customer. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods. The amount of consideration the Company receives and revenue the Company recognizes varies with changes in customer incentives the Company offers to its customers and their customers. Sales taxes and other similar taxes are excluded from revenue. Customer Advances — From time to time the Company requires deposits in advance of delivery of products and/or production runs. Such amounts are initially recorded as customer advances liability within other current liabilities. The Company recognizes such revenue as it is earned in accordance with revenue recognition policies. As of December 31, 2019, and 2018, the Company did not have any customer advances. Advertising Costs — Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. The Company uses mainly radio, local sampling events, sponsorships, endorsements, and digital advertising. The Company incurred marketing and advertising expenses of approximately $7.9 million and $13.8 million, during years ending December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Research and Development — Research and development costs are charged to general and administrative expenses as incurred and consist primarily of consulting fees, raw material usage and test productions of beverages. The Company incurred expenses of $341,000 and $572,000 during years ending December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Foreign Currency Translation — Foreign subsidiaries’ functional currency is the local currency of operations and the net assets of foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates. The U.S. dollar results that arise from such translation, as well as exchange gains and losses on intercompany balances of long-term investment nature, are included in Comprehensive Income. The Company incurred foreign currency translation losses during the year ending in December 31, 2019 of approximately $60,500 and a gain of approximately $12,400 during the year ending December 31, 2018. Fair Value of Financial Instruments — The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and notes payable approximates fair value due to their relative short-term maturity and market interest rates. F- 11 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2019 and 2018 Fair Value Measurements - ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally, ASC 820 requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized below: Other than these noted previously, the Company did not have any other assets or liabilities measured at fair value at December 31, 2019 and 2018. Income Taxes — The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the provisions of ASC 740-10, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” which requires, among other things, an asset and liability approach to calculating deferred income taxes. The asset and liability approach require the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets for which management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred asset will not be realized. The Company follows the provisions of the ASC 740 -10 related to, Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Positions. When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10, the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. F- 12 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2019 and 2018 Income Taxes (continued) — Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. The Company believes its tax positions are all highly certain of being upheld upon examination. As such, the Company has not recorded a liability for uncertain tax benefits. The Company has adopted ASC 740-10-25 Definition of Settlement, which provides guidance on how an entity should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits and provides that a tax position can be effectively settled upon the completion of an examination by a taxing authority without being legally extinguished. For tax positions considered effectively settled, an entity would recognize the full amount of tax benefit, even if the tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained based solely on the basis of its technical merits and the statute of limitations remains open. The Company’s tax returns for tax years in 2016 through 2019 remain subject to potential examination by the taxing authorities. Earnings per Share — Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income (loss) available to stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share are computed using the weighted average number of common and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding during the period. Under ASC 260-10-45-16, the calculation of diluted earnings per share, the numerator should be adjusted to add back any convertible dividends and the after-tax amount of interest recognized in the period associated with any convertible debt. The denominator should include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued. The effects of dilutive instruments have been presented for the year-to-date net income as of December 31, 2019. Other periods presented do not reflect the dilutive shares, as the effects would be anti-dilutive due to the fact that losses are being reflected for those periods. Please refer to the below table for additional details: F- 13 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2019 and 2018 Share-Based Payments —The Company follows the provisions of ASC Topic 718 “Compensation — Stock Compensation” and related interpretations. As such, compensation cost is measured on the date of grant at the fair value of the share-based payments. Such compensation amounts, if any, are amortized over the respective vesting periods of the grants. On April 30, 2015, the Company adopted the 2015 Stock Incentive Plan. This plan is intended to provide incentives which will attract and retain highly competent persons at all levels as employees of the Company, as well as independent contractors providing consulting or advisory services to the Company, by providing them opportunities to acquire the Company’s common stock or to receive monetary payments based on the value of such shares pursuant to Awards issued. The 2015 Plan permits the grant of options and shares for up to 5,000,000 shares. In addition, there is a provision for an annual increase of 15% to the shares included under the plan, with the shares to be added on the first day of each calendar year, beginning on January 1, 2017 (note 19). Cost of Sales — Cost of sales consists of the cost of concentrates and or beverage bases, the costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of products, co-packing fees, repacking fees, in-bound & out-bound freight charges, as well as certain internal transfer costs, warehouse expenses incurred prior to the manufacture of the Company’s finished products and certain quality control costs. Raw materials account for the largest portion of the cost of sales. Raw materials include cans, bottles, other containers, flavors, ingredients and packaging materials. Operating Expenses — Operating expenses include selling expenses such as warehousing expenses after manufacture, as well as expenses for advertising, samplings and in-store demonstrations costs, costs for merchandise displays, point-of-sale materials and premium items, sponsorship expenses, other marketing expenses and design expenses. Operating expenses also include such costs as payroll costs, travel costs, professional service fees (including legal fees), depreciation and other general and administrative costs. Shipping and Handling Costs — Shipping and handling costs for freight-out expense on goods shipped are included in cost of sales expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Freight-out expense on goods shipped for years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $6.3 million and $5.5 million, respectively. Recent Accounting Pronouncements The Company adopts all applicable, new accounting pronouncements as of the specified effective dates. Leases — The Company adopted ASU No. 2016-02, as amended, effective January 1, 2019. The adoption of the standard will result in the recognition of right to use assets and lease liabilities that have not been previously recorded (note 7). In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, “Intangibles and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment”, which eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill, but rather requires an entity to record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying value over its fair value. This amendment is effective for annual or interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurements (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. The amendments in this update modify the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements in Topic 820. The ASU is effective for the Registrants for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this standard on their Financial Statements. F- 14 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2019 and 2018 Recent Accounting Pronouncements (continued) All new accounting pronouncements issued but not yet effective are not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position with the exception of the updated previously disclosed above, there have been no new accounting pronouncements not yet effective that have significance to our consolidated financial statements. Liquidity — These financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will be able to continue as a going concern. At December 31, 2019, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $63,409,431 which includes a net income available to common stockholders of $9,971,260 for year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ending December 31, 2019 the Company’s net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately $1,034,000 . On September 16, 2019 the Company issued 7,986,110 in a public placement and obtained gross proceeds of $28,749,996 and paid $1,585,000 in commissions & fees and incurred in $209,559 of expenses related to the capital raise thereby resulting in net-proceeds in the amount of $26,955,437. Management deems that there is sufficient liquidity to properly operate the business for the next 12 twelve months. Information about the Company’s net sales by reporting segment for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 is as follows: License Agreement In January 2019, the Company entered into a license and repayment of investment agreement with Qifeng Food Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd (“Qifeng”). Under the agreement, Qifeng was granted the exclusive license rights to manufacture, market and commercialize Celsius branded products in China. The term of the agreement is 50 years, with annual royalty fees due from Qifeng after the end of each calendar year. The royalty fees are based on a percentage of Qifeng’s sales of Celsius branded products; however, the fees are fixed for the first five years of the agreement, totaling approximately $6.9 million, and then are subject to annual guaranteed minimums over the remaining term of the agreement. Under the agreement, the Company grants Qifeng exclusive license rights and provides ongoing support in product development, brand promotion and technical expertise. The ongoing support is integral to the exclusive license rights and, as such, both of these represent a combined, single performance obligation. The transaction price consists of the guaranteed minimums and the variable royalty fees, all of which are allocated to the single performance obligation. The Company recognizes revenue from the agreement over time because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits from the services. The Company uses the passage of time to measure progress towards satisfying its performance obligation because its efforts in providing the exclusive license rights and ongoing support occur on a generally even basis throughout the year. Total revenue recognized under the agreement was approximately $346,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 which is included as part of other current assets and is reflected in the Company’s Asia reporting segment which was determined by the minimum royalties due during first year, as per the licensing agreement. Inventories consist of the following at: F- 15 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2019 and 2018 Prepaid expenses and other current assets total $4,170,000 and $2,300,000, at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and consist mainly of prepaid advances to co-packers related to inventory production, advertising, prepaid insurance, prepaid slotting fees, value added tax payments and deposits on purchases. Note receivable consists of the following at: On January 1, 2019, the Company entered into a license and repayment of investment agreement with Qifeng Food Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd (“Qifeng”). Under the agreement, Qifeng will repay the market investment Celsius has made into China to date, over a five-year period, under an unsecured, interest-bearing note receivable (“Note”). The initial outstanding principal under the Note was approximately $12.2 million which is denominated in Chinese Renminbi (CNY) and was recorded as Other Income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2019. The amount recognized considered the net of the balances of the accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, as well as the marketing investments that were performed in the China market. Scheduled principal payments plus accrued interest are due annually on March 31 of each year starting in 2020. The Note is recorded at amortized cost basis and accrues interest at a rate per annum equal to the weighted average of 5% of the outstanding principal up to $5 million and 2% of the outstanding principal above $5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the weighted average interest rate was 3.21% and interest income was approximately $382,000. The Company assesses the Note for impairment periodically by evaluating whether it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all the contractual interest and principal payments as scheduled in the Note agreement, based on historical experience about Qifeng’s ability to pay, the current economic environment and other factors. If the Note is determined to be impaired, the impairment is measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flows under the Note, discounted at the Note’s effective interest rate. At December 31, 2019, the Note was not deemed to be impaired. The first installment of the note in the amount of RMB 13,253,093 is due on March 31, 2020. We were requested to provide a 3-month consideration to delay payment until June 30, 2019, due to the impact of the health crisis in China. For this consideration, a guarantee was obtained for the full amount of the first-installment and offers as collateral stock certificates in Celsius Holdings, Inc., which amount to 570,412 shares. The consideration was provided and therefore payment in full of the first installment is expected to be provided on June 30, 2020. F- 16 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2019 and 2018 In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02 (ASU 2016-02), Leases (Topic 842). Topic 842 requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use (ROU) asset and lease liability in the balance sheet for all leases, including operating leases with terms of more than twelve months. The Company adopted Topic 842, as amended, effective January 1, 2019. Upon adopting Topic 842, the Company recognized a ROU asset of $259,358 and a corresponding lease liability pertaining to the Company’s operating lease of its corporate office space from a related party (see Note 20), measured based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments utilizing the Company’s incremental borrowing rate as the basis for the computations. ROU assets also include any lease payments made and exclude lease incentives. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. The adoption of Topic 842 did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations or consolidated statements of cash flows, and did not result in a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings in the period of adoption. The Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the Topic 842, which allowed the Company to carry forward the historical lease classification, not reassess prior conclusions related to expired or existing contracts that are or that contain leases, and not reassess the accounting for initial direct costs. In addition to the Company’s operating lease of its corporate office space, the Company acquired certain other leases of vehicles and office space as part of its Acquisition of Func Food during the fourth quarter of 2019 (see Note 10). At the inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. The Company’s assessment is based on: (1) whether the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (2) whether the Company obtains the right to substantially all the economic benefit from the use of the asset throughout the term, and (3) whether the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. At inception of a lease, the Company allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease and non-lease component based on the component’s relative stand-alone price to determine the lease payments. Lease and non-lease components are accounted for separately. Leases are classified as either finance leases or operating leases based on criteria in Topic 842. The Company’s operating leases are generally comprised of real estate and vehicles, and the Company’s finance leases are generally comprised of vehicles. Lease expense for operating leases, consisting of lease payments, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Included in lease expense are any variable lease payments incurred in the period that were not included in the initial lease liability. Lease expense for finance leases consists of the amortization of the ROU asset on a straight-line basis over the asset’s estimated useful life and interest expense is calculated using the effective interest rate method. F- 17 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2019 and 2018 The following is a summary of lease cost recognized in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019: The following is a summary of the impact of the Company’s leases on the consolidated statements of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019: The following is a summary of the weighted average remaining lease term and weighted average discount rate for the Company’s population of leases as of December 31, 2019: The future annual minimum lease payments required under the Company’s leases as of December 31, 2019 are as follows: F- 18 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2019 and 2018 Property and equipment consist of the following at: Depreciation expense amounted to $66,939 and $51,205 during year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Goodwill consists of approximately $10,023,806 resulting from the excess of the consideration paid and the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired from the Func Food Acquisition (see note 10). There was no other activity related to goodwill during the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018. Intangible assets consist of acquired customer relationships and brands from the Func Food Acquisition, amounting to approximately $14,050,000 and $3,123,000, respectively. Customer relationships are amortized over an estimated useful life of 25 years and brands have an indefinite life. The following is the future estimated amortization expense related to customer relationships as of December 31, 2019: F- 19 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2019 and 2018 The Company acquired 100% of Func Food Group, Oyj (“Func Food) on October 25, 2019 (“the Acquisition”). The Acquisition was structured as a purchase of all of Func Food’s equity shares and a restructuring of Func Food’s pre-existing debt. Total consideration was $27,060,701, which consisted of approximately $14,188,000 in cash, $8,357,000 of newly issued bonds (see Note 14) and $4,516,000 related to the settlement of a pre-existing debt. In addition to the aforementioned bond issuance, the Company financed the acquisition by issuing new common shares. Func Food is a marketer and distributor of nutritional supplements, health food products and beverages, that support sport activities and healthy living and lifestyles in Finland, Sweden, and Norway. Func Food has been the Nordic distributor of Celsius products since 2015 and, as a result of the acquisition, the Company expects to further increase its Nordic market share by leveraging collaborations, revamping its marketing strategy and focusing on core products. It also expects to reduce costs through economies of scale. The Company recorded the acquisition in accordance with ASC-805, pertaining to business combinations. The following table summarizes the consideration paid for Func Food and the amounts of the assets acquired at fair market value and liabilities assumed recognized at the Acquisition date. F- 20 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2019 and 2018 The following pro-forma consolidated results of operations have been presented as if the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2018 For the year ended December 31, 2019, pro forma earnings include approximately $6.7 million of historical, non-recurring charges of Func Food that are not expected to have an ongoing effect after the Acquisition. These non-recurring charges consist of $2.2 million of inventory impairment charges, $0.3 million of restructuring charges, and $4.2 million of incremental interest expense on Func Food’s historical debt that was restructured as part of the Acquisition. Consequently, 2019 earnings would have amounted to $8.5 million had these non-recurring expenses not been incurred. For the year ended December 31, 2018, pro forma earnings includes approximately $15.3 million of historical, non-recurring charges of Func Food that are not expected to have an ongoing effect after the Acquisition. These non-recurring charges consist of $1.6 million of inventory impairment charges, $0.4 million of restructuring charges, $9.1 million of intangible asset and goodwill impairment, and $4.2 million of incremental interest expense on Func Food’s historical debt that was restructured as part of the acquisition. The year ended December 31, 2018 would have reflected a loss of $19.1million had these non-recurring expenses not been incurred. Accounts payable and accrued expenses consist of the following at: F- 21 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2019 and 2018 Other current liabilities consist of the following at: Line of credit convertible note payable - related party consists of the following as of: F- 22 Celsius Holdings, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2019 and 2018 Bonds payable consists of the following as of: Bonds issued as part of the purchase consideration to acquire Func Food (see note 9). The Bonds are Euro-denominated, unregistered, and were issued on October 25, 2019 at an initial nominal amount of approximately $9.1 million, less discount and issuance costs of approximately $0.7 million. The Bonds accrue interest at a stated interest rate of 6.00% per annum, due semi-annually in arrears, with the first interest payment due on April 30, 2020. The maturity date of the Bonds is October 30, 2020. The Bonds are carried at the nominal amount, less any unamortized discount and issuance costs. The discount is amortized using the effective interest rate method. As of December 31, 2019, the unamortized balance of the discount is approximately $377,000. Amortization of the discount was approximately $78,250 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The bond issuance costs amounted to $229,250. The issuance costs are being amortized over a straight-line basis, given the short-term nature and that it does not result in a material difference from applying the effective interest rate method. Amortization of the bond issuance costs from the issuance date through December 31, 2019 was $40,938. Upon maturity of the Bonds, the Company may, at its own election, convert up to 50% of the outstanding nominal amount of the Bonds into shares of common stock of the Company, at a conversion price relative to the 30-day weighted-average trading price of the Company’s common shares prior to the Acquisition. At the Company’s election, the Bonds are callable at 103% at any time. Additionally, mandatory prepayments would be required in the event of either i) a capital raise consummated by the Company or ii) the sale of a certain product line of Func Food. To the fullest extent possible, the net proceeds derived from either event must first be applied towards prepayment of the bonds at 103%, plus any accrued but unpaid interest on the repaid amount. The Bonds are unsubordinated and are guaranteed by Func Food and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. The Bonds are secured by substantially all the assets of Func Food. The Bonds contain certain financial covenants that are specific to Func Food, mainly related to minimum cash requirements at the end of each quarter. As of December 31, 2019, Func Food is in compliance with these covenants. F- 24 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2019 and 2018 The Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with CDS Ventures of South Florida, LLC (“CDS”) and CD Financial, LLC (“CD”). CDS and CD are limited liability companies which are affiliates of Carl DeSantis, the Company’s principal shareholder. The Company issued 2,200 shares of its Series C Preferred Stock (the “Preferred C Shares”) in exchange for the conversion of a $550,000 short term loan from CDS and the conversion of $1,650,000 in indebtedness under the Company’s line of credit with CD (the “CD Line of Credit”). The Preferred C Shares are convertible into our common stock at the option of the holder thereof at a conversion price of $0.52 per share at any time until December 31, 2018, at which time they will automatically convert into shares of our common stock determined by dividing the liquidation preference of $1,000 per Preferred C Share by the conversion price then in effect. The conversion price is subject to adjustment in the event of stock dividends, stock splits and similar events. The Preferred C Shares accrue cumulative annual dividends at the rate of 6% per annum, payable by the issuance of additional Preferred C Shares. The holder of Preferred C Shares votes on an “as converted” basis, together with holders of common stock as a single class on all matters presented to shareholders for a vote, except as required by law. In April 2015, the Company issued 180 Preferred C Shares valued at $180,000 in settlement of $180,000 in accrued preferred C dividends. In October 2018, the Company issued 383 Preferred C Shares valued at $383,000 in settlement of $383,000 in accrued preferred C dividends. As of December 31, 2018, $255,903 of dividends has been accrued and converted into 256 of additional Preferred C. The Preferred C Shares matured on December 31, 2018 and were exchanged for shares of Company common stock in the amount of 5,806,022. On April 16, 2015, the Company entered into an amendment to its existing Loan and Security Agreement (the “Amendment”) with CD an affiliate of CDS Ventures and Mr. DeSantis. Pursuant to the Amendment, the outstanding principal amount of the CD note payable was reduced by $4.0 million, which amount was converted into 4,000 shares of a newly-designated Series D Preferred Stock (the “Preferred D Shares”). This related party was given a conversion price of $0.86 per common share, whereas other investors purchased common shares at $0.89 in the private placement, as discussed in note 12. The difference of $0.03 per share, which resulted in $139,535, was recorded as a dividend in accordance with ASC 470-20-35, subsequent measurement for debt with conversion and other options. The Preferred D Shares are convertible into our common stock at the option of the holder thereof at a conversion price of $0.86 per share until the earlier of the January 2, 2021 due date of our note payable with CD Financial or such earlier date as the note payable is satisfied (the “Maturity Date”). The conversion price is subject to adjustment in the event of stock dividends, stock splits and similar events. The Preferred D Shares accrue cumulative annual cash dividends at the rate of 5% per annum, payable quarterly in cash and have a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share. On the Maturity Date, the Preferred D Shares automatically convert into shares of our common stock in a number determined by dividing the $1,000 per Preferred D Share liquidation preference plus any accrued but unpaid dividends, by the conversion price then in effect. The Holder shall have the right, at its election, to require the Company to redeem all or any portion of the shares held by the holder in exchange for cash or common stock upon the occurrence of certain events which management believes are under the control of the Company. As of March 31, 2018, none of the contingent events have occurred and in accordance with ASC-480-10-25 “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity” and Regulation S-X-Rule 5-02-27, the Company has classified these shares as permanent equity. The Preferred D Shares may also be redeemed by us at any time on or after December 31, 2017, at a redemption price equal to 104% of the liquidation preference. The holder of the Preferred D Shares votes on an “as converted” basis, together with holders of common stock as a single class on all matters presented to shareholders for a vote, except as required by law. In March 2018, the Preferred D shares were converted into 4,651,163 shares of common stock. F- 25 Celsius Holdings, Inc.

Moreover, also as per the terms of the agreements, in the event of financing greater than $25.0 million, the principal value of the notes and any accrued but unpaid interest are automatically converted into the company’s common stock. As result of the public financing which raised $26,955,437, the principal balance of the notes payable and the accrued but unpaid interest of $10,233,332 were converted resulting in the issuance of 3,196,460, shares of common stock. The shares were issued at the contractual conversion prices per the loan agreements. Refer to Note 13 for discussion on the conversion of the notes payable. F- 26 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2019 and 2018 Due to recurring losses for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company’s net tax provision was zero. The difference between the effective income tax rate and the applicable statutory federal income tax rate is summarized as follows: At December 31, 2019 and 2019, the Company’s deferred tax assets were as follows: The Company’s valuation allowance increased by $1,184,000 and $2,012,000 during 2019 and 2018 respectively. Total net operating loss carry forwards at December 31, 2019 were approximately $33.1 million, of which approximately $31.9 million, will expire between 2029 and 2037 and $1.2 million may be carried forward indefinitely. China has corporate tax rate of 25% with net operating loss carry forwards expiring after 5 years. The Company had $14.7 million of net operating loss carry forwards in China as of December 31, 2019. Hong Kong has a corporate tax rate of 17% with net operating loss carry forwards that don’t expire. The Company had $2.8million of net operating loss carry forwards in Hong Kong as of December 31, 2019. On October 25, 2019, the Company acquired wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries in Finland, Sweden and Norway. These companies had net operating loss carryforwards of $11.2 million in Finland and $12.9 million in Sweden. There were no net operating loss carryforwards in Norway. The Finland tax rate is 33.6% and the Sweden tax rate is 21.4%. Due to the uncertainty regarding the Company’s ability to retain the tax benefits of these losses in Sweden, the Company has not included these net operating loss carryforwards as part of their deferred tax assets. The Company’s net operating loss carry forwards may be limited due to ownership changes. The Company adopted an Incentive Stock Plan on January 18, 2007. This plan is intended to provide incentives which will attract and retain highly competent persons at all levels as employees of the Company, as well as independent contractors providing consulting or advisory services to the Company, by providing them opportunities to acquire the Company’s common stock or to receive monetary payments based on the value of such shares pursuant to Awards issued. While the plan terminates 10 years after the adoption date, issued options have their own schedule of termination. During 2013, the majority of the shareholders approved to increase the total available shares in the plan from 2.5 million to 3.5 million shares of common stock. During May 2014, the majority of the shareholders approved to increase the total available shares in the plan from 3.5 million to 4.25 million shares of common stock, during February 2015, the majority of the shareholders approved to increase the total available shares in the plan from 4.25 million to 4.6 million shares of common stock and during April 2015, the majority of the shareholders approved to increase the total available shares in the plan from 4.6 million to 5.1 million shares of common stock. Options to acquire shares of common stock may be granted at no less than fair market value on the date of grant. Upon exercise, shares of new common stock are issued by the Company. F- 27 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2019 and 2018 The Company adopted the 2015 Stock Incentive Plan on April 30, 2015. This plan is intended to provide incentives which will attract and retain highly competent persons at all levels as employees of the Company, as well as independent contractors providing consulting or advisory services to the Company, by providing them opportunities to acquire the Company’s common stock or to receive monetary payments based on the value of such shares pursuant to Awards issued. The 2015 Plan permits the grant of options and shares for up to 5,000,000 shares. In addition, there is a provision for an annual increase of 15% of the shares pertaining to the 2015 plan that are outstanding as of the last day of the prior year. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 400,000 shares are available. Under the 2015 Stock Incentive Plan, the Company has issued options to purchase approximately 6.53 million shares at an average price of $3.58 with a fair value of $5.10 million. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company issued options to purchase 1.20 million and 1.83 million shares. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company recognized an expense of approximately $4.8 million and $4.3 million, respectively, of non-cash compensation expense (included in General and Administrative expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations) determined by application of a Black Scholes option pricing model with the following inputs: exercise price, dividend yields, risk-free interest rate, and expected annual volatility. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had approximately $8,531,047 of unrecognized pre-tax non-cash compensation expense, which the Company expects to recognize, based on a weighted-average period of 3 years. The Company used straight-line amortization of compensation expense over the two to three-year requisite service or vesting period of the grant. There are options to purchase approximately 2.35 million shares that have vested as of December 31, 2019. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of its stock option awards and warrant issuances. The calculation of the fair value of the awards using the Black - Scholes option-pricing model is affected by the Company’s stock price on the date of grant as well as assumptions regarding the following: 4.02-5.00 Years F- 28 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2019 and 2018 The expected volatility was determined with reference to the historical volatility of the Company’s stock. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination within the valuation model. The expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury rate in effect at the time of grant. A summary of the status of the Company’s outstanding stock options as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 and changes during the periods ending on that date is as follows: The following table summarizes information about employee stock options outstanding at December 31, 2019: F- 29 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2019 and 2018 As previously reported, on December 18, 2018, Rockstar, Inc. (“Rockstar”) filed suit against Celsius in federal district court in the District of Nevada. Rockstar’s complaint alleged three claims for relief: (a) false advertising in violation of 15 USC §1125(a); (b) violation of the Nevada Deceptive Trade Practice Act; and (c) Nevada common law unfair competition. On January 16, 2020 the parties entered into a non-monetary settlement of this litigation. On April 8, 2019, Daniel Prescod filed suit against Celsius in the Superior Court for the State of California, County of Los Angeles (the “Prescod Litigation”). Daniel Prescod asserts that the Company’s use of citric acid in its products while simultaneously claiming “no preservatives” violates California Consumer Legal Remedies Act, California Business and Professions Code Section 17200, et seq., and California Business and Professions Code Section 17500, et seq., because citric acid acts as a preservative. The Company does not use citric acid as a preservative in its products, but rather as a flavoring, and therefore it believes that its “no preservatives” claim is fair and not deceptive. The Company intends to contest the claims vigorously. Since this matter is still in its initial stages, the Company is unable to predict the outcome at this time. On January 24, 2020, Evlution Nutrition, LLC filed suit against Celsius in federal court for the Southern District of Florida, for trademark infringement (the “Evlution Litigation”). Evlution asserts that Celsius’ BCAA dietary supplement product’s use of BCAA + ENERGY infringes upon Evlution’s registered trademarks. The Company believes that Evlution’s trademarks are invalid, merely descriptive, and unenforceable and Celsius has filed a cancellation proceeding regarding those trademarks with the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board of the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The Company intends to defend against Evlution’s claims vigorously. Since this matter is still in its initial stages, the Company is unable to predict the outcome at this time. In addition to the foregoing, from time to time, we may become party to litigation or other legal proceedings that we consider to be a part of the ordinary course of our business. The Company has entered into distribution agreements with liquidated damages in case the Company cancels the distribution agreements without cause. Cause has been defined in various ways. It is management’s belief that no such agreement has created any liability as of December 31, 2019. In February 2020, the Company’s board of directors and majority shareholders authorized an increase in the number of shares of common stock which the Company is authorized to issue from 75 million shares to 100 million shares. Implementation of the increase is subject to compliance with SEC requirements. The first installment of the note receivable from Qifeng Food Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd (Note 6) in the amount of RMB 13,253,093 was due on March 31, 2020. We were recently requested by Qifeng to provide a three-month extension of the due date for the first installment until June 30, 2019, due to the impact of the health crisis in China. In consideration of the extension, a guarantee was obtained for the full amount of the first-installment and the installment was collateralized by a pledge of 570,412 of our common shares held. Accordingly, Celsius granted the extension and as a result, payment in full of the first installment is expected to be paid on or before June 30, 2020. Between January 1, 2020 and March 12, 2020, the Company issued an aggregate of 297,949 shares of its common stock pursuant to the exercise of stock options granted under the Company’s 2015 Stock Incentive Plan.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ” and elsewhere in this Report. PART I Overview We are engaged in the development, marketing, sale and distribution of “ functional ” calorie-burning fitness beverages under the Celsius ® brand name. According to multiple clinical studies we funded, a single serving of Celsius ® burns 100 to 140 calories by increasing a consumer’s resting metabolism an average of 12% and providing sustained energy for up to a three-hour period. Our exercise focused studies show Celsius delivers additional benefits when consumed prior to exercise. The studies show benefits such as increase in fat burn, increase in lean muscle mass and increased endurance. We seek to combine nutritional science with mainstream beverages by using our proprietary thermogenic (calorie-burning) MetaPlus ® formulation, while fostering the goal of healthier everyday refreshment by being as natural as possible without the artificial preservatives often found in many energy drinks and sodas. Celsius ® has no artificial preservatives, aspartame or high fructose corn syrup and is very low in sodium. Celsius ® uses good-for-you ingredients and supplements such as green tea (EGCG), ginger, calcium, chromium, B vitamins and vitamin C. The main Celsius ® line of products is sweetened with sucralose, a sugar-derived sweetener that is found in Splenda ®, which makes our beverages low-calorie and suitable for consumers whose sugar intake is restricted. We have undertaken significant marketing efforts aimed at building brand awareness, including a wide variety of marketing vehicles such as television, radio, digital, social media, sponsorships, and magazine advertising. We also undertake various promotions at the retail level such as coupons and other discounts in addition to in-store sampling. We have entered into agreements with various distributors to sell our products domestically and abroad, particularly in Sweden and the Far East. We do not directly manufacture our beverages, but instead outsource the manufacturing process to established third-party co-packers. We do, however, provide our co-packers with flavors, ingredient blends, cans and other raw materials for our beverages purchased by us from various suppliers. 3 Corporate History We were incorporated in Nevada on April 26, 2005 under the name “ Vector Ventures, Inc .” and originally engaged in mineral exploration. Such business was unsuccessful. On January 26, 2007, we acquired the Celsius ® beverage business of Elite FX, Inc., a Florida corporation engaged in the development of “functional” beverages since 2004 in a reverse merger, and subsequently changed our name to Celsius Holdings, Inc. We currently have one Florida subsidiary, Celsius Netshipments, Inc., established in 2007, one Nevada subsidiary, Celsius, Inc., established in 2007, two Hong Kong corporate subsidiaries, Celsius Asia Holdings Limited and Celsius China Holdings Limited, established in 2017 and a Chinese corporate subsidiary, Celsius (Beijing) Beverage Co. Limited, also established in 2017. Our Products Celsius ® calorie-burning beverages were first introduced to the marketplace in 2005. According to multiple clinical studies we funded, a single serving (12 ounce can) of Celsius ® burns 100 to 140 calories by increasing a consumer’s metabolism an average of 12% for up to a three-hour period. In addition, these studies have indicated that drinking a single serving of Celsius ® prior to exercising may improve cardiovascular health and fitness and enhance the loss of fat and gain of muscle from exercise. We seek to combine nutritional science with mainstream beverages by using our proprietary thermogenic (calorie-burning) MetaPlus ® formulation, while fostering the goal of healthier everyday refreshment by being as natural as possible without the artificial preservatives often found in many energy drinks or sodas. Celsius ® has no chemical preservatives, aspartame or high fructose corn syrup and is very low in sodium. Celsius ® uses good-for-you ingredients and supplements such as green tea (EGCG), ginger, calcium, chromium, B vitamins and vitamin C. Celsius is sweetened with sucralose, a sugar-derived sweetener that is found in Splenda ® , which makes our beverages low-calorie and suitable for consumers whose sugar intake is restricted. Each 12 ounce can of Celsius ® contains 200 milligrams of caffeine which is comparable to one 12-ounce cup of coffee from the leading coffeehouse. Our original Celsius® product line is currently offered in eight flavors: orange, wild berry, cola, grape, kiwi-guava and watermelon (which are carbonated), and non-carbonated green tea raspberry/acai, and green tea/peach mango. Celsius® is packaged in a distinctive 12 ounce sleek can that uses vivid colors in abstract patterns to create a strong on-shelf impact. The cans are sold as singles or in four-packs. We have recently redesigned our packaging to provide a cleaner, crisper and more modern look. We also sell a powdered form of the active ingredients in our beverages in individual On-The-Go packets as well as multiple serving canisters. In addition to being sugar free, our original ready-to -drink product line is non-GMO, kosher and vegan certified and soy and gluten free. In 2018, Celsius introduced its first product line extension focused on broadening the reach of Celsius® into the natural channel. The natural line extension is available in refreshing flavors: three sparkling - grapefruit, cucumber lime, orange pomegranate and three non-carbonated - pineapple coconut, watermelon berry and strawberries & cream. The natural line extension boasts a clean ingredient panel featuring 100% natural caffeine-from-green-coffee bean extract, and an all-natural sweetener. Like the original Celsius® products, our new natural ready-to -drink beverages are non-GMO, kosher and vegan certified and soy and gluten free. During 2018, we also introduced the second line in our product portfolio, trainer’s grade Celsius Heat™. Celsius Heat™ is also a dietary supplement, that uses the same proprietary thermogenic MetaPlus® formula as Celsius®, which is proven to accelerate metabolism, boost energy and accelerate calorie and fat burn when combined with exercise. Celsius Heat™, which is packed with 2,000mg of L-citrulline and 300mg of caffeine. Comes in seven carbonated flavors: Apple Jack’d, Orangesicle, Inferno Punch, Cherry Lime, Blueberry Pomegranate, Strawberry Dragonfruit, and Tangerine Grapefruit. We target a niche in the functional beverage segment of the beverage industry consisting of consumers seeking calorie-burning beverages to help them manage their weight and enhance their exercise regimen. Our target consumers are generally individuals that exercise two to five times a week and are concerned about their health. 4 Clinical Studies It is our belief that clinical studies substantiating product claims will become more important as more and more beverages are marketed with health claims. Celsius ® was one of the first functional beverages to be launched along with a clinical study. Celsius ® is also one of very few functional beverages that has clinical research on the actual product itself. Some beverage companies that do mention studies backing their claims are referencing independent studies conducted on one or more of the ingredients in the product. We believe that it is important and will become more important to have studies on the actual product. We have funded seven U.S. based clinical studies for Celsius ® . Each was conducted by a research organization and each studied the total Celsius ® formula. The first study was conducted by the Ohio Research Group of Exercise Science & Sports Nutrition. The remaining studies were conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of the University of Oklahoma. We funded all of the studies and provided Celsius® beverage for the studies. However, none of our directors, executive officers or principal shareholders is in any way affiliated with either of the two research organizations which conducted the studies. The first study was conducted in 2005 by the Ohio Research Group of Exercise Science & Sports Nutrition www.ohioresearchgroup.com . The Ohio Research Group of Exercise Science & Sports Nutrition is a multidisciplinary clinical research team dedicated to exploring the relationship between exercise, nutrition, dietary supplements and health. This placebo-controlled, double-blind cross-over study compared the effects of Celsius ® and the placebo on metabolic rate. Twenty-two participants were randomly assigned to ingest a 12 ounce serving of Celsius ® and on a separate day a serving of twelve ounces of Diet Coke ® . All subjects completed both trials using a randomized, counterbalanced design. Randomized means that subjects were selected for each group randomly to ensure that the different treatments were statistically equivalent. Counterbalancing means that individuals in one group drank the placebo on the first day and drank Celsius ® on the second day. The other group did the opposite. Counterbalancing is a design method that is used to control “order effects.” In other words, this was done to make sure that the order that subjects were served does not impact the results and analysis. Metabolic rate (via indirect calorimetry, measurements taken from breaths into and out of calorimeter) and substrate oxidation (via respiratory exchange ratios) were measured at baseline (pre-ingestion) and for ten minutes at the end of each hour for three hours post-ingestion. The results showed an average increase of metabolism of twelve percent over the three-hour period, compared to a statistically insignificant change for the control group. Metabolic rate, or metabolism, is the rate at which the body expends energy. This is also referred to as the “caloric burn rate.” Indirect calorimetry calculates heat that living organisms produce from their production of carbon dioxide. It is called “indirect” because the caloric burn rate is calculated from a measurement of oxygen uptake. Direct calorimetry would involve the subject being placed inside the calorimeter for the measurement to determine the heat being produced. Respiratory Exchange Ratio is the ratio oxygen taken in a breath compared to the carbon dioxide breathed out in one breath or exchange. Measuring this ratio can be used for estimating which substrate (fuel such as carbohydrate or fat) is being metabolized or ‘oxidized’ to supply the body with energy. The second study was conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2007. This blinded, placebo-controlled study was conducted on a total of 60 men and women of normal weight. An equal number of participants were separated into two groups to compare one serving (a single 12 ounce can) of Celsius ® to a placebo of the same amount. According to the study, those subjects consuming Celsius ® burned significantly more calories versus those consuming the placebo, over a three-hour period. The study confirmed that over the three-hour period, subjects consuming a single serving of Celsius ® burned 65% more calories than those consuming the placebo beverage and burned an average of more than 100 to 140 calories compared to the placebo. These results were statistically significant. The third study, conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2007, extended our second study with the same group of 60 individuals and protocol for 28 days and showed the same statistical significance of increased calorie burn (minimal attenuation). While the University of Oklahoma study did extend for 28 days, more testing would be needed for long term analysis of the Celsius ® calorie-burning effects. Also, although these studies were on relatively small numbers of subjects, they have statistically significant results. Additional studies on a larger number and wider range of body compositions can be considered to further the analysis. Our fourth study, conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2009, combined Celsius ® use with exercise. This ten-week placebo-controlled, randomized and blinded study was conducted on a total of 37 subjects. Participants were randomly assigned into one of two groups: Group 1 consumed one serving of Celsius ® per day, and Group 2 consumed one serving of an identically flavored and labeled placebo beverage. Both groups participated in ten weeks of combined aerobic and weight training, following the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines of training for previously sedentary adults. The results showed that consuming a single serving of Celsius ® prior to exercising may enhance the positive adaptations of exercise on body composition, cardio-respiratory fitness and endurance performance. According to the preliminary findings, subjects consuming a single serving of Celsius ® lost significantly more fat mass and gained significantly more muscle mass than those subjects consuming the placebo — a 93.75% greater loss in fat and 50% greater gain in muscle mass, respectively. The study also confirmed that subjects consuming Celsius® significantly improved measures of cardio-respiratory fitness and the ability to delay the onset of fatigue when exercising to exhaustion. 5 Our fifth study was conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2009. This ten-week placebo-controlled, randomized and blinded study was conducted on a total of 27 previously sedentary overweight and obese female subjects. Participants were randomly assigned into groups that consumed identically tasting treatment beverages with exercise or without exercise. All participants consumed one drink, either placebo or Celsius ® , per day for 10 weeks. The exercise groups participated in ten weeks of combined aerobic and weight training, following the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines of training for previously sedentary adults. No changes were made to their diet. The results showed that consuming a single serving of Celsius ® prior to exercising may improve cardiovascular health and fitness and enhance the positive adaptations of exercise on body composition. According to the preliminary findings, subjects consuming a single serving of Celsius ® lost significantly more fat mass and gained significantly more muscle mass when compared to exercise alone — a 46% greater loss in fat, 27% greater gain in muscle mass, respectively. The study also confirmed that subjects consuming Celsius ® significantly improved measures of cardio-respiratory fitness — 35% greater endurance performance with significant improvements to lipid profiles — total cholesterol decreases of 5 to 13% and bad LDL cholesterol 12 to 18%. Exercise alone had no effect on blood lipid levels. Our sixth study was conducted by the Applied Biochemistry & Molecular Physiology Laboratory of University of Oklahoma in 2009. This ten-week placebo-controlled, randomized and blinded study was conducted on a total of 37 previously sedentary male subjects. Participants were randomly assigned into groups that consumed identically tasting treatment beverages with exercise or without exercise. All participants consumed one drink, either placebo or Celsius ® , per day for 10 weeks. The exercise groups participated in ten weeks of combined aerobic and weight training, following the American College of Sports Medicine guidelines of training for previously sedentary adults. No changes were made to their diet. The results showed that consuming a single serving of Celsius ® prior to exercising may improve cardiovascular health and fitness and enhance the positive adaptations of exercise on body composition. Significantly greater decreases in fat mass and percentage body fat and increases in VO 2 were observed in the subjects that consumed Celsius ® before exercise versus those that consumed the placebo before exercise. Mood was not affected. Clinical markers for hepatic, renal, cardiovascular and immune function, as determined by pre-and post-blood work revealed no adverse effects. Our seventh study was conducted by Miami Research Institute in 2010 and demonstrated the efficacy and safety of the powders and the shots. This study allows the Company to make the same structure/function claims as the ready to drink beverages. Manufacture and Supply of Our Products Our beverages are produced by established third party beverage co-packers. A co-packer is a manufacturing plant that provides the service of filling bottles or cans for the brand owner. We believe one benefit of using co-packers is that we do not have to invest in the production facility and can focus our resources on brand development, sales and marketing. It also allows us produce in multiple locations strategically placed throughout the country. We purchase most of the ingredients and all packaging materials. The co-pack facility assembles our products and charges us a fee by the case. The shelf life of Celsius ® is specified as 15 to 18 months. Substantially all of the raw materials used in the preparation, bottling and packaging of our products are purchased by us or by our co-packers in accordance with our specifications. Generally, we obtain the ingredients used in our products from domestic suppliers and some ingredients have several reliable suppliers. The ingredients in Celsius ® include green tea (EGCG), ginger (from the root), caffeine, B vitamins, vitamin C, taurine, guarana, chromium, calcium, glucuronolactone, sucralose, natural flavors and natural colorings. Celsius ® is labeled with a supplements facts panel. We have no major supply contracts with any of our suppliers. We single-source all our ingredients for purchasing efficiency; however, we have identified a second source for our critical ingredients and there are many suppliers of flavors, colorings and sucralose. In case of a supply restriction or interruption from any of the flavor and coloring suppliers, we would have to test and qualify other suppliers that may disrupt our production schedules. Packaging materials, except for our distinctive sleek aluminum cans, are easily available from multiple sources in the United States; however, due to efficiencies we utilize single source vendor relationships. We believe that our co-packing arrangement and supply sources are adequate for our present needs. Distribution Domestic In the United States and elsewhere in North America, Celsius ® is sold across many retail segments. They include supermarkets, convenience stores, drug stores, nutritional stores, and mass merchants. We also sell to health clubs, spas, gyms, the military, e-commerce websites and a limited number of international markets. 6 We distribute our products domestically through a hybrid of direct-store delivery (DSD) distributors and as well as sales direct to retailers (DTR). International Internationally, we distribute our products through regional and country-specific distribution partners. During 2018, we focused a significant part of our marketing efforts on expanding our global reach into the Asian market, which is one of the most dynamic and fastest-growing, making it an important target in our pursuit of global growth. Having a diverse, established and expanding product line, we increased our investment in this key market with the launch and expansion of two important relationships and the formation of an experienced, focused regional team. In September 2017, we entered China with our partner, Qifeng Food Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd. (“ Qifeng ”). With exciting success, we began both local production and initial distribution of the Celsius ® brand. The initial distribution covered select channels across three Tier-1 cities - Beijing, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, as well as in over 30 other cities across 14 provinces. Consumer response has been overwhelmingly positive and signals that our plan for broader product distribution in China is in-line with market opportunities. At the same time, we are also accelerating our distribution in Hong Kong through our partnership with A.S. Watson Industries. The foundation of our business in Asia is with strong, capable partners, and we are committed to building on our success to further grow our brand and increase placements of our products. Effective January 1, 2019, we have restructured our China distribution efforts by entering into a license and repayment of investment agreement with Qifeng, thereby creating a risk-mitigated method of capturing market share in China. Under the agreement, Qifeng has been granted the exclusive license rights to manufacture, market and commercialize Celsius® brand products in China. Qifeng pay a fixed royalty fee of $6.9 million for the five years, transitioning to a volume-based royalty fee, thereafter. In addition, Qifeng Food will repay all capital Celsius has invested into the China market to date, over a five-year period. Sales to one customer, a foreign distributor of our products, accounted for 16% and 30% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Accordingly, if sales to this customer were to significantly decline or cease entirely, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. Seasonality of Sales As is typical in the beverage industry, sales of our beverages are seasonal, with the highest sales volumes generally occurring in the second and third fiscal quarters, which correspond to the warmer months of the year in our major markets. Competition We believe that we are one of the few calorie-burning fitness beverages whose effectiveness is supported by clinical studies, which gives us a unique position in the beverage market. However, our products do compete broadly with all categories of consumer beverages. The beverage market is highly competitive, and includes international, national, regional and local producers and distributors, most of whom have greater financial, management and other resources than us. Our direct competitors in the functional beverage market include, but are not limited to The Coca-Cola Company, Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, PepsiCo, Inc., Nestlé, Waters North America, Inc., Hansen Natural Corp., Monster Energy, and Red Bull. Proprietary Rights We have registered the Celsius ® and MetaPlus ® trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, as well as a number of additional trademarks. We have and will continue to take appropriate measures, such as entering into confidentiality agreements with our contract packers and ingredient suppliers, to maintain the secrecy and proprietary nature of our MetaPlus ® formulation and product formulas. We maintain our MetaPlus ® formulation and product formulas as trade secrets. We believe that trade secrecy is a preferable method of protection for our formulas as patenting them might require their disclosure. Other than a company that is our outsourced production manager, no single member of the raw material supply chain or our co-packers has access to the complete formula. We consider our trademarks and trade secrets to be of considerable value and importance to our business. No successful challenges to our registered trademarks have arisen and we have no reason to believe that any such challenges will arise in the future. Government Regulation The production, distribution and sale of our products in the United States is subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act , the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 , the Occupational Safety and Health Act , various environmental statutes and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations applicable to the production, transportation, sale, safety, advertising, labeling and ingredients of such products. California law requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a component listed by California as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects. The law exposes all food and beverage producers to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products because the law recognizes no generally applicable quantitative thresholds below which a warning is not required. Consequently, even trace amounts of listed components can expose affected products to the prospect of warning labels. Products containing listed substances that occur naturally in the product or that are contributed to the product solely by a municipal water supply are generally exempt from the warning requirement. While none of our products are required to display warnings under this law, we cannot predict whether an important component of any of our products might be added to the California list in the future. We also are unable to predict whether or to what extent a warning under this law would have an impact on costs or sales of our products. 7 Measures have been enacted in various localities and states that require that a deposit be charged for certain non-refillable beverage containers. The precise requirements imposed by these measures vary. Other deposit, recycling or product stewardship proposals have been introduced in certain states and localities and in Congress, and we anticipate that similar legislation or regulations may be proposed in the future at the local, state and federal levels, both in the United States and elsewhere. Our facilities in the United States are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Compliance with these provisions has not had, and we do not expect such compliance to have, any material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations. Employees As of the date of this Report, the Company employs 50 persons, including its executive officers. Our business faces certain risks. The risks described below may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently think as immaterial, may also impair our business. If any of the events anticipated by the risks described below or elsewhere in this report occur, our results of operations and financial conditions could be adversely affected. Risk Factors Relating to Our Business We have a history of losses and we may experience additional losses in the futures. The Company has a history of losses, including net losses available to common shareholders of $11,419,781 and $8,606,578 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Our future operating results will depend on many factors, both in and out of our control, including the ability to increase and sustain demand for and acceptance of our products, the level of our competition, and our ability to attract and maintain key management and key employees. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we can attain consistent profitability. We rely on third party co-packers to manufacture our products. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our co-packers and/or their ability to manufacture our products becomes constrained or unavailable to us, our business could suffer. We do not directly manufacture our products, but instead outsource such manufacturing to established third party co-packers. These third-party co-packers may not be able to fulfill our demand as it arises, could begin to charge rates that make using their services cost inefficient or may simply not be able to or willing to provide their services to us on a timely basis or at all. In the event of any disruption or delay, whether caused by a rift in our relationship or the inability of our co-packers to manufacture our products as required, we would need to secure the services of alternative co-packers. We may be unable to procure alternative packing facilities at commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time period and any such transition could be costly. In such case, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. We rely on distributors to distribute our products in the DSD sales channel and in international markets. If we are unable to secure such distributors and/or we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing distributors, our business could suffer. We distribute Celsius ® in the DSD sales channel by entering into agreements with direct-to-store delivery distributors having established sales, marketing and distribution organizations. We similarly are seeking to expand our international distribution, particularly in the Far East and elsewhere in Asia by entering into agreements with large established distributors who service those markets. Many of our distributors are affiliated with and manufacture and/or distribute other beverage products. In many cases, such products compete directly with our products. The marketing efforts of our distributors are important for our success. If Celsius ® proves to be less attractive to our distributors and/or if we fail to attract distributors, and/or our distributors do not market and promote our products with greater focus in preference to the products of our competitors, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. 8 Our customers are material to our success. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing customers, our business could suffer. Unilateral decisions could be taken by our distributors, grocery chains, convenience chains, drug stores, nutrition stores, mass merchants, club warehouses and other customers to discontinue carrying all or any of our products that they are carrying at any time, which could cause our business to suffer. One customer accounts for a significant portion of our revenues. If sales to this customer were to significantly decline or cease , our business could be significantly harmed . Sales to a foreign customer of our products accounted for 16% and 30% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Accordingly, if sales to this customer were to significantly decline or cease entirely, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be significantly harmed. Increases in cost or shortages of raw materials or increases in costs of co-packing could harm our business . The principal raw materials used by us are flavors and ingredient blends as well as aluminum cans, the prices of which are subject to fluctuations. We are uncertain whether the prices of any of the above or any other raw materials or ingredients we utilize will rise in the future and whether we will be able to pass any of such increases on to our customers. We do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials. In addition, some of these raw materials, such as our distinctive sleek 12 ounce can, are available from a single or a limited number of suppliers. As alternative sources of supply may not be available, any interruption in the supply of such raw materials might materially harm us. Our failure to accurately estimate demand for our products could adversely affect our business and financial results. We may not correctly estimate demand for our products. If we materially underestimate demand for our products and are unable to secure sufficient ingredients or raw materials, we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis, in which case our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We depend upon our trademarks and proprietary rights, and any failure to protect our intellectual property rights or any claims that we are infringing upon the rights of others may adversely affect our competitive position. Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to protect our current and future brands and products and to defend our intellectual property rights. We cannot be sure that trademarks will be issued with respect to any future trademark applications or that our competitors will not challenge, invalidate or circumvent any existing or future trademarks issued to, or licensed by, us. Our products are manufactured using our proprietary blends of ingredients. These blends are created by third-party suppliers to our specifications and then supplied to our co-packers. Although all of the third parties in our supply and manufacture chain execute confidentiality agreements, there can be no assurance that our trade secrets, including our proprietary ingredient blends will not become known to competitors. We believe that our competitors, many of whom are more established and have greater financial and personnel resources than we do, may be able to replicate or reverse engineer our processes, brands, flavors, or our products in a manner that could circumvent our protective safeguards. Therefore, we cannot give you any assurance that our confidential business information will remain proprietary. Any such loss of confidentiality could diminish or eliminate any competitive advantage provided by our proprietary information. We may incur material losses as a result of product recall and product liability . We may be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury, illness or death. We also may be required to recall some of our products if they become contaminated or are damaged or mislabeled. A significant product liability judgment against us, or a widespread product recall, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The amount of the insurance we carry is limited, and that insurance is subject to certain exclusions and may or may not be adequate. Our lack of product diversification and inability to timely introduce new or alternative products could cause us to cease operations. Our business is centered on Celsius ® and our recent product line extensions, including Celsius Heat™. The risks associated with focusing on a limited product line are substantial. Even though we recently announced our first product line extension, if consumers do not accept our products or if there is a general decline in market demand for, or any significant decrease in, the consumption of functional beverages, we are not financially or operationally capable of introducing alternative products within a short time frame. As a result, such lack of acceptance or market demand decline could cause us to cease operations. 9 We are dependent on our key executives and employees and the loss of any of their services could materially adversely affect us which may have a material adverse effect on our Company. Our future success will depend substantially upon the abilities of, and personal relationships developed by our key executives and employees. The sudden loss of the services of any key executive or employee could materially adversely affect our business and our prospects for the future. We do not have key person insurance on the lives of such individuals. We are dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified technical, sales and managerial personnel . Our future success depends in part on our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical, sales and managerial personnel. Competition for such personnel in the beverage industry is intense and we may not be able to retain our key managerial, sales and technical employees or attract and retain additional highly qualified technical, sales and managerial personnel in the future. Any inability to attract and retain the necessary technical, sales and managerial personnel could materially adversely affect us. The FDA has not passed on the efficacy of our products or the accuracy of any claim we make related to our products. Although six independent clinical studies have been conducted relating to the calorie-burning and related effects of our products, the results of these studies have not been submitted to or reviewed by the FDA. Further, the FDA has not passed on the efficacy of any of our products nor has it reviewed or passed on any claims we make related to our products, including the claim that our products aid consumers in burning calories or enhancing their metabolism. Risk Factors Relating to Our Industry We are subject to significant competition in the beverage industry . The beverage industry is highly competitive. The principal areas of competition are pricing, packaging, distribution channel penetration, development of new products and flavors and marketing campaigns. Our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of manufacturers, most of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution resources and name recognition than we do. Important factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include the taste and flavor of our products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective development of new, unique cutting-edge products, attractive and different packaging, branded product advertising and pricing. Our products compete with all liquid refreshments and with products of much larger and substantially better financed competitors, including the products of numerous nationally and internationally known producers, such as The Coca Cola Company, Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, PepsiCo, Inc., Nestle, Waters North America, Inc., Hansen Natural Corp. and Red Bull. We also compete with companies that are smaller or primarily local in operation. Our products also compete with private label brands such as those carried by supermarket chains, convenience store chains, drug store chains, mass merchants and club warehouses. There can be no assurance that we will compete successfully in the functional beverage industry. The failure to do so would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We compete in an industry that is brand-conscious, so brand name recognition and acceptance of our products are critical to our success and significant marketing and advertising could be needed to achieve and sustain brand recognition. Our business is substantially dependent upon awareness and market acceptance of our products and brands by our targeted consumers. Our business depends on acceptance by our independent distributors of our brand as one that has the potential to provide incremental sales growth rather than reduce distributors’ existing beverage sales. The development of brand awareness and market acceptance is likely to require significant marketing and advertising expenditures. There can be no assurance that Celsius ® will achieve and maintain satisfactory levels of acceptance by independent distributors and retail consumers. Any failure of the Celsius ® brand to maintain or increase acceptance or market penetration would likely have a material adverse effect on business, financial condition and results of operations. Our sales are affected by seasonality. As is typical in the beverage industry, our sales are seasonal. Our highest sales volumes generally occur in the second and third quarters, which correspond to the warmer months of the year in our major markets. Consumer demand for our products is also affected by weather conditions. Cool, wet spring or summer weather could result in decreased sales of our beverages and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Our business is subject to many regulations and noncompliance is costly . The production, marketing and sale of our beverage products are subject to the rules and regulations of various federal, state and local health agencies. If a regulatory authority finds that a current or future product or production run is not in compliance with any of these regulations, we may be fined, or production may be stopped, thus adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, any adverse publicity associated with any noncompliance may damage our reputation and our ability to successfully market our products. Furthermore, the rules and regulations are subject to change from time to time and while we closely monitor developments in this area, we have no way of anticipating whether changes in these rules and regulations will impact our business adversely. Additional or revised regulatory requirements, whether labeling, environmental, tax or otherwise, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 10 Risk Factors Relating to our Status as a Fully Reporting Public Company We are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) that require us to incur audit fees and legal fees in connection with the preparation of such reports. These additional costs could reduce or eliminate our ability to earn a profit. We are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and as a result, we are now required to file periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “ SEC ”) pursuant to the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. In order to comply with these requirements, our independent registered public accounting firm has to review our financial statements on a quarterly basis and audit our financial statements on an annual basis. Moreover, our legal counsel has to review and assist in the preparation of such reports. The costs charged by these professionals for such services cannot be accurately predicted at this time because factors such as the number and type of transactions that we engage in and the complexity of our reports cannot be determined at this time and will have a major effect on the amount of time to be spent by our auditors and attorneys. However, the incurrence of such costs will obviously be an expense to our operations and thus have a negative effect on our ability to meet our overhead requirements and earn a profit. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our common stock, if a market ever develops, could drop significantly. If we do not maintain an effective internal control environment as well as adequate control procedures over our financial reporting, investor confidence may be adversely affected thereby affecting the value of our stock price We are required to maintain proper internal control over our financial reporting and adequate controls related to our disclosures. As defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. If we fail to maintain adequate controls, our business, the results of operations, financial condition and/or the value of our stock may be adversely impacted. 11 Risk Factors Related to our Common Stock We cannot guarantee the continued existence of an active established public trading market for our common stock. Our common stock currently is listed for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market. Trading in stock quoted on the Nasdaq Capital Market may often experience wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance. 12 Market prices for our common stock may also be influenced by a number of other factors, including: Our board of directors has the authority, without shareholder approval, to issue preferred stock with terms that may not be beneficial to common shareholders and with the ability to affect adversely shareholder voting power and perpetuate their control over us. Our Articles of Incorporation allows our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without any vote or further action by our shareholders. Our board of directors has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock. As a result, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation, the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock and the right to the redemption of the shares, together with a premium, prior to the redemption of our common stock. The ability of our principal shareholders to control our business may limit or eliminate minority shareholders’ ability to influence corporate affairs. Our principal shareholders own common stock and/or preferred stock which holds a majority of the voting power of our issued and outstanding capital. Accordingly, they will be able to effectively control the election of directors, as well as all other matters requiring shareholder approval. The interests of our principal shareholders may differ from the interests of other shareholders with respect to the issuance of shares, business transactions with or sales to other companies, selection of other directors and other business decisions. The minority shareholders have no way of overriding decisions made by our principal shareholders. This level of control may also have an adverse impact on the market value of our shares because our principal shareholders may institute or undertake transactions, policies or programs that result in losses, may not take any steps to increase our visibility in the financial community and / or may sell sufficient numbers of shares to significantly decrease our price per share. We do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future . We have never paid cash dividends on our common stock. We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock at any time in the foreseeable future. The future payment of dividends directly depends upon our future earnings, capital requirements, financial requirements and other factors that our board of directors will consider. Since we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock, return on your investment, if any, will depend solely on an increase, if any, in the market value of our common stock. The “market overhang” from our outstanding options, warrants and convertible securities could adversely impact the market price of our common stock . As of the date of this Report, we have 4,808,347 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding options and warrants and conversion of outstanding convertible securities. Such “ market overhang ” could adversely impact the market price of our common stock as a result of the dilution which would result if such securities were exercised for or converted into shares of common stock. 13 Not applicable to the Company because we are a “ smaller reporting company .” At present, we do not own any real property. We currently lease our principal executive offices located at 2424 N Federal Highway, Boca Raton, Florida 33431. Our premises are leased for a monthly cost of $12,452. The current lease expires on October 2020. The Company has no warehouses or other facilities as we store our product at third party contract warehouse facilities. Legal Proceedings. On February 22, 2017, we were served with a summons and complaint with respect to a breach of contract action filed in Superior Court of the State of California, Los Angeles County, by Statewide Beverage Company, Inc. (“Statewide”), a former distributor of the Company’s products, whose distribution agreement, with the Company had terminated effective November 2016 for “cause” (non-payment of invoices within the applicable grace period provided in the distribution agreement). The complaint alleged that the distribution agreement was terminated without “cause” and sought unspecified damages consisting of termination payments and fees which would be due upon a termination without “cause,” but not on a termination for “cause” as well as certain invasion fees allegedly due under the terms of the distribution agreement. The Company settled this case as of July 31, 2018 for three cash payments over a five (5) month period through January 1, 2019 totaling $750,000 and the issuance of 60,000 restricted shares of our common stock, valued at $4.66 per share. Accordingly, the total impact of this settlement amounted to $1,029,600. In our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2018, we reported that an action for damages was brought against the Company in July 2018 in Circuit Court, Palm Beach County, Florida by Johnny Nunez, a photographer who performed certain services for us. In December 2018, that action was dismissed by the plaintiff without prejudice. On December 18, 2018, Rockstar, Inc. (“ Rockstar ”) filed suit against Celsius in federal district court in the District of Nevada. Rockstar’s complaint alleges three claims for relief: (a) false advertising in violation of 15 USC §1125(a); (b) violation of the Nevada Deceptive Trade Practice Act; and (c) Nevada common law unfair competition. On January 30, 2019, Celsius filed its answer to the complaint denying the allegations by Rockstar, and setting forth certain affirmative defenses. The action is in its initial stages and no discovery has taken place. Celsius believes that it has not committed the violations alleged, that it has strong defenses, and it intends to vigorously defend itself against the claims by Rockstar. In addition to the foregoing, from time to time, we may become party to litigation or other legal proceedings that we consider to be a part of the ordinary course of our business. Not applicable. 14 PART II Market Information Since May 24, 2017, our common stock has been listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “ CELH .” Holders As of March 14, 2019, there were 69 holders of record of our common stock and in excess of 5,465 beneficial owners of our common stock. 15 Securities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities Not Applicable .

Results of Operations Year ended December 31, 2018 compared to year ended December 31, 2017 Revenue For the year ended December 31, 2018, revenue was approximately $52.6 million, an increase of $16.4 million or 45% from $36.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This revenue growth was mainly associated with the results of the North American region which delivered an increase of $14.8 million over last year or 62% increase. The Asia region contributed growth of $3.5 million in revenues when compared to 2017. Our revenue performance was partially offset by a contraction in our European revenue of $1.8 million due to normalization of inventory levels, changes in flavors as well as the impact of restructuring changes in our Nordics distributor. The overall increase in revenue from 2017 to 2018 was primarily attributable to an increase in sales volume, as opposed to increases in product pricing. 16 The following table sets forth the amount of revenues by category and changes therein for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017: Gross profit For the year ended December 31, 2018, gross profit increased by approximately $5.6 million or 36% to $21.0 million from $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Gross profit margins totaled 40% and 43% in the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The reduction in gross margin profitability is mainly related to increases in promotional allowances, product repackaging and increase in freight costs. The increase in gross profit dollars from 2017 to 2018 is primarily attributable to the increases in revenue. Sales and marketing expenses Sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018, were approximately $21.2 million, an increase of $4.6 million, or 28% from $16.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase is due primarily to incremental in investments in sales and marketing programs which totaled $14.6 million in 2018, with focus on expansion and the launch of products into China and Hong Kong which accounted for approximately $7.1 million. The increase in sales and marketing expenses from 2017 to 2018 also reflected increased warehouse costs of $394,000, broker costs of $422,000 and increases in human resource investments of $1.1 million respectively. As a result of the royalty license and repayment of investment agreement entered into effective January 1, 2019 with Qifeng, our distribution partner in China., we anticipate that selling in marketing expenses in China will decrease in subsequent periods. General and administrative expenses General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 were approximately $10.5 million, an increase of $3.6 million, or 52%, from $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher stock-based compensation of $2.1 million and other general administration expenses of $1.5 million, mainly related the settlement of a lawsuit with a former distributor of approximately $1.0 million. Other expense Total other expense increased by approximately $405,000 for year ended December 31, 2018 to $566,000 from $161,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, mainly related to the recognition of a loss on debt extinguishment of $377,000 and amortization of discounts on notes payable of $28,000. Net Loss As a result of all the above, for the year ended December 31, 2018, Celsius had a net loss of $11.2 million and after giving effect to preferred stock dividends of $213,133, a net loss of $11.4 million or $0.23 per share based on a weighted average of 50,050,696 shares outstanding. In comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2017 we had a net loss of $8.2 million, and after giving effect to preferred stock dividends of $366,000, a net loss of $8.6 million or $0.19 per share based on a weighted average of 44,419,162 shares outstanding. A significant portion of the increase in net loss was attributable to increased expenses incurred in connection with entering and commencing distribution of our products in the Asian market and stock-based compensation expense. 17 Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, we had cash of approximately $7.7 million and $14.2 million, respectively and working capital of approximately $20.2 million and $20.6 million, respectively. Cash used in operations during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, totaled approximately $12.1 million and $8.4 million, respectively, reflecting increases in inventories on hand, accounts receivable and investments in sales and marketing programs as well as human resources initiatives. In addition to cash flow from operations, our primary sources of working capital have been private placements of our securities and our credit facilities with CD Financial, LLC (“CD Financial”), an affiliate of Carl DeSantis, a principal shareholder of the Company, as well as Charmnew Limited and Grieg International Limited. We originally entered into a loan and security agreement with CD Financial in July 2010, which provided us with a line of credit to fund operations. As amended in connection with a private investment transaction consummated in April 2015, the loan and security agreement provided Celsius with a revolving line of credit pursuant to which Celsius can borrow up to an aggregate maximum of $4.5 million from time to time until maturity in January 2020. The credit facility requires quarterly cash payments of interest only at the rate of five percent (5%) per annum until maturity and is secured by a pledge of substantially all the Company’s assets. The Company entered into Convertible Loan Agreements (the “ Loan Agreements ”) with its affiliates Charmnew Limited (“ Charmnew ”) and Grieg International Limited (“ Grieg ”) on December 12, 2018, and with its affiliate CD Financial on December 14, 2018, providing for aggregate loans to the Company in principal amounts of US$3,000,000, US$2,000,000 and US$5,000,000. In connection with the Loan Agreements, the Company executed and delivered Convertible Promissory Notes (the “ Notes ”) in favor of each of Charmnew, Grieg and CD Financial. The Loan Agreement and Note entered into with CD Financial replaces the existing credit facility between the Company and CD Financial described above. The other material terms and conditions of the loan transactions are as follows: Our current operating plan for the next twelve (12) months indicates a sufficient financial condition and we do not contemplate obtaining additional financing. However, if our sales volumes do not meet our projections, expenses exceed our expectations, or our plans change, we may be unable to generate enough cash flow from operations to cover our working capital requirements. In such case, we may be required to adjust our business plan, by reducing marketing and other expenses or seek additional financing. There can be no assurance that such financing, if required, will be available on commercially reasonable terms if at all. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of December 31, 2018, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. Not applicable. 18 The financial statements and supplementary data listed in “ Item 15 Financials Statements and Exhibits ” are attached to this Report. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure Not applicable. Disclosure controls and procedures Our President and Chief Executive Officer as well as our Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of December 31, 2018, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms adopted by the SEC, including to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and our Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial and accounting officer), or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of December 31, 2018, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in that (a) we maintain records that in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (b) our records provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and board of directors; and (c) our records provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. Our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer do not expect that our disclosure controls or internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. Although our disclosure controls and procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our principal executive officer and our Chief Financial Officer have determined that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at doing so, a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented if there exists in an individual a desire to do so. There can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on the framework set forth in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013). Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and financial officers and effected by the Company’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: 19 Based on the evaluation conducted under the above-referenced framework, our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of December 31, 2018, our internal control over financial reporting was effective. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm Effective with the filing of this report, the Company is deemed to be an “ accelerated filer ” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Accordingly, we have included the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm in Item 8 setting forth our registered public accounting firm’s attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Item 308 (b) of Regulation S-K. Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2018, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 20 PART III Directors and Executive Officers The following sets forth the name of each of our directors and executive officers and their positions with Celsius: John Fieldly was named Chief Executive Officer in April 2018 and has served as a director since March 2017.

The audit committee currently consists of Messrs. Lynch, Kravitz and Milmoe, the compensation committee currently consists of Messrs.

Our board of directors has determined that each of our directors is “ independent ” within the meaning of the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the listing standards of the Nasdaq Stock Market. In addition, we believe each of Messrs.

At the time of the listing of our common stock for trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market, we will be required to certify to the Nasdaq Stock Market, that our audit committee has, and will continue to have, at least one member who has past employment experience in finance or accounting, requisite professional certification in accounting, or other comparable experience or background that results in the individual’s financial sophistication.

Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Assurance Dimensions We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2017.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2018 and 2017 Business —Celsius Holdings, Inc. (the “ Company ” or “ Celsius Holdings ”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on April 26, 2005. On January 24, 2007, the Company entered into a merger agreement and plan of reorganization with Elite FX, Inc., a Florida corporation. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Elite FX, Inc. was merged into the Company’s subsidiary, Celsius, Inc. and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company on January 26, 2007. In addition, on March 28, 2007 the Company established Celsius Netshipments, Inc. a Florida corporation as two subsidiaries of the Company. On February 7, 2017, the Company established Celsius Asia Holdings Limited a Hong Kong corporation as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. On February 7, 2017 Celsius China Holdings Limited a Hong Kong corporation became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Celsius Asia Holdings Limited and on May 9, 2017, Celsius Asia Holdings Limited established Celsius (Beijing) Beverage Limited, a China corporation as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Celsius Asia Holdings Limited. The Company is engaged in the development, marketing, sale and distribution of “ functional ” calorie-burning fitness beverages under the Celsius® brand name. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”). Consolidation Policy — The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Celsius Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All material inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Significant Estimates — The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include the allowance for doubtful accounts, reserves for inventory obsolescence, the useful lives and values of property, fixtures and equipment, valuation of stock based compensation, and deferred tax asset valuation allowance. Segment Reporting — Although the Company has a number of operating divisions, separate segment data has not been presented, as they meet the criteria for aggregation as permitted by ASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting, (formerly Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 131, Disclosed About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information.) Our chief operating decision-maker is considered to be our Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The CEO reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance. The financial information reviewed by the CEO is identical to the information presented in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. Therefore, the Company has determined that it operates in a single operating segment. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 all material assets and revenues of the Company were in the United States except as disclosed in Note 2. F- 8 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2018 Concentrations of Risk — Substantially all of the Company’s revenue derives from the sale of Celsius ® beverages. The Company uses single supplier relationships for its raw materials purchases and filling capacity, which potentially subjects the Company to a concentration of business risk. If these suppliers had operational problems or ceased making product available to the Company, operations could be adversely affected. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with high-quality financial institutions. At times, balances in the Company’s cash accounts may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit. At December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately $6.76 million in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had the following 10 percent or greater concentrations of revenue with its customers: At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had the following 10 percent or greater concentrations of accounts receivable with its customers: *Revenues from customer A are derived from a customer located in Sweden. Revenues from all other customers were mainly derived from the United States. Receivables from customer B are obtained from a customer located in China. Cash Equivalents — The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. At December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company did not have any investments with maturities of three months or less. Accounts Receivable — Accounts receivable are reported at net realizable value. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors pertaining to the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends, and other information. Delinquent accounts are written-off when it is determined that the amounts are uncollectible. At December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, there was an allowance for doubtful accounts of $183,000 and $33,100, respectively. F- 9 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2018 Inventories — Inventories include only the purchase cost and are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is determined using the FIFO method. Inventories consist of raw materials and finished products. The Company establishes an inventory reserve to reduce the value of the inventory during the period in which such materials and products are no longer usable or marketable. Specifically, the Company reviews inventory utilization during the past twelve months and also customer orders for subsequent months. If there has been no utilization during the last 12 months and there are no orders in-place in future months which will require the use of inventory item, then inventory item will be included as part of the reserve during the period being evaluated. Management will then specifically evaluate whether these items may be utilized within a reasonable time frame (e.g., 3 to 6 months). In 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded inventory reserves in the amount of $74,650 and $36,300, respectively. The inventory reserve is included in cost of revenue. Free Samples are recorded as cost of sales. Property and Equipment — Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation of property and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset generally ranging from three to seven years. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets — In accordance with ASC Topic 360, “Property, Plant, and Equipment” the Company reviews the carrying value of intangibles and other long-lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of long-lived assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the undiscounted cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the property, if any, exceeds its fair value. Revenue Recognition — As of January 1, 2018, the Company adopted Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“ASC 606”). The new guidance sets forth a new five-step revenue recognition model which replaces the prior revenue recognition guidance in its entirety and is intended to eliminate numerous industry-specific pieces of revenue recognition guidance that have historically existed in U.S. GAAP. The underlying principle of the new standard is that a business or other organization will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects to receive in exchange for the goods or services. The standard also requires more detailed disclosures and provides additional guidance for transactions that were not addressed completely in the prior accounting guidance. The Company adopted the standard using the modified retrospective method and the adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. The Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied. Product sales occur once control is transferred upon delivery to the customer. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods. The amount of consideration the Company receives and revenue the Company recognizes varies with changes in customer incentives the Company offers to its customers and their customers. Sales taxes and other similar taxes are excluded from revenue. Customer Advance — From time to time the Company requires deposits in advance of delivery of products and/or production runs. Such amounts are initially recorded as customer advances liability. The Company recognizes such revenue as it is earned in accordance with revenue recognition policies. Advertising Costs — Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. The Company uses mainly radio, local sampling events, sponsorships, endorsements, and digital advertising. The Company incurred advertising expense of approximately $13.8 million and $6.8 million, during year ending December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Research and Development — Research and development costs are charged to general and administrative expenses as incurred and consist primarily of consulting fees, raw material usage and test productions of beverages. The Company incurred expenses of $572,000 and $360,000 during year ending December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Foreign Currency Translation — Generally, foreign subsidiaries’ functional currency is the local currency of operations and the net assets of foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates. The U.S. dollar results that arise from such translation, as well as exchange gains and losses on intercompany balances of long-term investment nature, are included in Comprehensive Income. The Company incurred foreign currency translation gains during the year ending in December 31, 2018 of approximately $12,400 and a loss of approximately $39,978 during the twelve months ending December 31, 2017. Fair Value of Financial Instruments — The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and notes payable approximates fair value due to their relative short-term maturity and market interest rates. F- 10 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2018 Fair Value Measurements - ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally, ASC 820 requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized below: Other than these noted previously, the Company did not have any other assets or liabilities measured at fair value at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. Income Taxes — The Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the provisions of ASC 740-10, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” which requires, among other things, an asset and liability approach to calculating deferred income taxes. The asset and liability approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets for which management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred asset will not be realized. The Company follows the provisions of the ASC 740 -10 related to, Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Positions. When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10, the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. F- 11 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2018 Income Taxes (continued) — Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. The Company believes its tax positions are all highly certain of being upheld upon examination. As such, the Company has not recorded a liability for uncertain tax benefits. The Company has adopted ASC 740-10-25 Definition of Settlement, which provides guidance on how an entity should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits and provides that a tax position can be effectively settled upon the completion of an examination by a taxing authority without being legally extinguished. For tax positions considered effectively settled, an entity would recognize the full amount of tax benefit, even if the tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained based solely on the basis of its technical merits and the statute of limitations remains open. The Company’s tax returns for tax years in 2015 through 2018 remain subject to potential examination by the taxing authorities. Earnings per Share — Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income (loss) available to stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share are computed using the weighted average number of common and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding during the period. Dilutive common share equivalents consist of shares issuable upon conversion of convertible debt, exercise of stock options and warrants (calculated using the reverse treasury stock method). As of December 31, 2018, the convertible debt may be converted into additional shares of common stock amounting to 2,681,400. There were no other dilutive common shares equivalents, including convertible notes and warrants, as no common share equivalents had an exercise price below the ending closing price of the year. The effects of dilutive instruments have not been presented as the effects would be anti-dilutive. F- 12 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2018 Share-Based Payments —The Company follows the provisions of ASC Topic 718 “Compensation — Stock Compensation” and related interpretations. As such, compensation cost is measured on the date of grant at the fair value of the share-based payments. Such compensation amounts, if any, are amortized over the respective vesting periods of the grants. On April 30, 2015, the Company adopted the 2015 Stock Incentive Plan. This plan is intended to provide incentives which will attract and retain highly competent persons at all levels as employees of the Company, as well as independent contractors providing consulting or advisory services to the Company, by providing them opportunities to acquire the Company’s common stock or to receive monetary payments based on the value of such shares pursuant to Awards issued. The 2015 Plan permits the grant of options and shares for up to 5,000,000 shares. In addition, there is a provision for an annual increase of 15% to the shares included under the plan, with the shares to be added on the first day of each calendar year, beginning on January 1, 2017. Cost of Sales — Cost of sales consists of the cost of concentrates and or beverage bases, the costs of raw materials utilized in the manufacture of products, co-packing fees, repacking fees, in-bound & out-bound freight charges, as well as certain internal transfer costs, warehouse expenses incurred prior to the manufacture of the Company’s finished products and certain quality control costs. Raw materials account for the largest portion of the cost of sales. Raw materials include cans, bottles, other containers, flavors, ingredients and packaging materials. Operating Expenses — Operating expenses include selling expenses such as warehousing expenses after manufacture, as well as expenses for advertising, samplings and in-store demonstrations costs, costs for merchandise displays, point-of-sale materials and premium items, sponsorship expenses, other marketing expenses and design expenses. Operating expenses also include such costs as payroll costs, travel costs, professional service fees (including legal fees), depreciation and other general and administrative costs. Shipping and Handling Costs — Shipping and handling costs for freight-out expense on goods shipped are included in cost of sales expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Freight-out expense on goods shipped for year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was approximately $5.5 million and $3.3 million, respectively. Recent Accounting Pronouncements The Company adopts all applicable, new accounting pronouncements as of the specified effective dates. Leases — We have completed our initial assessment of the requirements of ASU No. 2016-02. We plan to adopt ASU No. 2016-02, as amended, effective January 1, 2019. The adoption of the standard will result in the recognition of right to use assets and lease liabilities that have not been previously recorded. Based on our initial assessment, we do not expect that the adoption of the ASU will have a material impact to our financial statements and disclosures. The company is continuing to monitor potential changes that have been proposed by the FASB and will assess any necessary changes to the implementation process as the guidance is actualized. In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. ASU 2017-15 clarifies the presentation and classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact of ASU 2017-15 on its financial statements and related disclosures. In October 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-16—Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory. This ASU improves the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. This ASU is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of this ASU to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. In November 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2017-18 (ASU 2017-18), Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash. This ASU provides guidance on the classification of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this ASU are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments in the ASU should be adopted on a retrospective basis. The Company does not expect that adoption of this ASU to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. F- 13 In May 2018, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2018-09; Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting. The amendments in this ASU amends the scope of modification accounting for share-based payment arrangements, provides guidance on the types of changes to the terms or conditions of share-based payment awards an entity is required to apply modification accounting under ASC 718. The amendments in this ASU are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326) (“ASU 2016-13”), which requires the immediate recognition of management’s estimates of current and expected credit losses. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years and interim reporting periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted after fiscal years beginning December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance on our financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurements (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement. The amendments in this update modify the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements in Topic 820. The ASU is effective for the Registrants for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this standard on their Financial Statements. In July 2018, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2018-11; Earnings Per Share (Topic 260); Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (Topic 480): Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): (Part I) Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features, (Part II) Replacement of the Indefinite Deferral for Mandatorily Redeemable Financial Instruments of Certain Non public Entities and Certain Mandatorily Redeemable Non controlling Interests with a Scope Exception. The guidance is intended to reduce the complexity associated with issuers’ accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity. Specifically, a down round feature (as defined) would no longer cause a freestanding equity-linked financial instrument (or an embedded conversion option) to be accounted for as a derivative liability at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in current earnings. The amendments in this ASU are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. F- 14 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2018 Recent Accounting Pronouncements (continued) All new accounting pronouncements issued but not yet effective are not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position with the exception of the updated previously disclosed above, there have been no new accounting pronouncements not yet effective that have significance to our consolidated financial statements. Liquidity — These financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will be able to continue as a going concern. At December 31, 2018, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $73,380,692 which includes a net loss available to common stockholders of $11,419,781 for year ended December 31, 2018. During the year ending December 31, 2018 the Company’s net cash used in operating activities totaled $11,646,420. In addition to cash flow from operations, our primary sources of working capital have been private placements of our securities and our credit facilities with CD Financial, LLC (“CD Financial”), an affiliate of Carl DeSantis, a principal shareholder of the Company, as well as Charmnew Limited and Grieg International Limited. Charmnew Limited is an existing shareholder of record affiliated with Li Ka Shing, one of our principal shareholders. Grieg International Limited is an existing shareholder of record affiliated with Chau Hoi Shuen Solina, one of our principal shareholders Our current operating plan for the next twelve (12) months plans on a sufficient financial condition and we do not contemplate obtaining additional financing. However, if our sales volumes do not meet our projections, expenses exceed our expectations, our plans change, we may be unable to generate enough cash flow from operations to cover our working capital requirements. In such case, we may be required to adjust our business plan, by reducing marketing and other expenses or seek additional financing. There can be no assurance that such financing, if required, will be available on commercially reasonable terms if at all. Information about the Company’s net sales by reporting segment for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows: Inventories consist of the following at: F- 15 Celsius Holdings, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2018 Other current liabilities consist of the following at: Line of credit convertible note payable - related party consists of the following as of: F- 17 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2018 The Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with CDS Ventures of South Florida, LLC (“CDS”) and CD Financial, LLC (“CD”). CDS and CD are limited liability companies which are affiliates of Carl DeSantis, the Company’s principal shareholder. The Company issued 2,200 shares of its Series C Preferred Stock (the “Preferred C Shares”) in exchange for the conversion of a $550,000 short term loan from CDS and the conversion of $1,650,000 in indebtedness under the Company’s line of credit with CD (the “CD Line of Credit”). The Preferred C Shares are convertible into our common stock at the option of the holder thereof at a conversion price of $0.52 per share at any time until December 31, 2018, at which time they will automatically convert into shares of our common stock determined by dividing the liquidation preference of $1,000 per Preferred C Share by the conversion price then in effect. The conversion price is subject to adjustment in the event of stock dividends, stock splits and similar events. The Preferred C Shares accrue cumulative annual dividends at the rate of 6% per annum, payable by the issuance of additional Preferred C Shares. The holder of Preferred C Shares votes on an “as converted” basis, together with holders of common stock as a single class on all matters presented to shareholders for a vote, except as required by law. In April 2015, the Company issued 180 Preferred C Shares valued at $180,000 in settlement of $180,000 in accrued preferred C dividends. In October 2017, the Company issued 383 Preferred C Shares valued at $383,000 in settlement of $383,000 in accrued preferred C dividends. As of December 31, 2018, $255,903 of dividends has been accrued and converted into 256 of additional Preferred C. The Preferred C Shares matured on December 31, 2018 and were exchanged for shares of Company common stock in the amount of 5,806,022. On April 16, 2015, the Company entered into an amendment to its existing Loan and Security Agreement (the “Amendment”) with CD an affiliate of CDS Ventures and Mr. DeSantis. Pursuant to the Amendment, the outstanding principal amount of the CD note payable was reduced by $4.0 million, which amount was converted into 4,000 shares of a newly-designated Series D Preferred Stock (the “Preferred D Shares”). This related party was given a conversion price of $0.86 per common share, whereas other investors purchased common shares at $0.89 in the private placement, as discussed in note 12. The difference of $0.03 per share, which resulted in $139,535, was recorded as a dividend in accordance with ASC 470-20-35, subsequent measurement for debt with conversion and other options. The Preferred D Shares are convertible into our common stock at the option of the holder thereof at a conversion price of $0.86 per share until the earlier of the January 2, 2021 due date of our note payable with CD Financial or such earlier date as the note payable is satisfied (the “Maturity Date”). The conversion price is subject to adjustment in the event of stock dividends, stock splits and similar events. The Preferred D Shares accrue cumulative annual cash dividends at the rate of 5% per annum, payable quarterly in cash and have a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share. On the Maturity Date, the Preferred D Shares automatically convert into shares of our common stock in a number determined by dividing the $1,000 per Preferred D Share liquidation preference plus any accrued but unpaid dividends, by the conversion price then in effect. The Holder shall have the right, at its election, to require the Company to redeem all or any portion of the shares held by the holder in exchange for cash or common stock upon the occurrence of certain events which management believes are under the control of the Company. As of March 31, 2018, none of the contingent events have occurred and in accordance with ASC-480-10-25 “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity” and Regulation S-X-Rule 5-02-27, the Company has classified these shares as permanent equity. The Preferred D Shares may also be redeemed by us at any time on or after December 31, 2017, at a redemption price equal to 104% of the liquidation preference. The holder of the Preferred D Shares votes on an “as converted” basis, together with holders of common stock as a single class on all matters presented to shareholders for a vote, except as required by law. In March 2018, the Preferred D shares were converted into 4,651,163 shares of common stock. F- 18 Celsius Holdings, Inc.

China has corporate tax rate of 25% with net operating loss carry forwards expiring after 5 years. The Company had $11.2 million of net operating loss carry forwards in China as of December 31, 2018. Hong Kong has a corporate tax rate of 17% with net operating loss carry forwards that don’t expire. The Company had $1.87million of net operating loss carry forwards in Hong Kong as of December 31, 2018. The Company’s net operating loss carry forwards may be limited due to ownership changes pursuant to Internal Revenue Code section 382. Effective December 22, 2018 a new tax bill was signed into law that reduced the federal income tax rate for corporations from 35% to 21%. The new bill reduced the blended tax rate for the Company from 38.5% to 25.35%. The change in blended tax rate reduced the 2017 US net operating loss carry forward deferred tax assets by approximately $5.5 million. The Company adopted an Incentive Stock Plan on January 18, 2007. This plan is intended to provide incentives which will attract and retain highly competent persons at all levels as employees of the Company, as well as independent contractors providing consulting or advisory services to the Company, by providing them opportunities to acquire the Company’s common stock or to receive monetary payments based on the value of such shares pursuant to Awards issued. While the plan terminates 10 years after the adoption date, issued options have their own schedule of termination. During 2013, the majority of the shareholders approved to increase the total available shares in the plan from 2.5 million to 3.5 million shares of common stock. During May 2014, the majority of the shareholders approved to increase the total available shares in the plan from 3.5 million to 4.25 million shares of common stock, during February 2015, the majority of the shareholders approved to increase the total available shares in the plan from 4.25 million to 4.6 million shares of common stock and during April 2015, the majority of the shareholders approved to increase the total available shares in the plan from 4.6 million to 5.1 million shares of common stock.

F- 20 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2018 The Company adopted the 2015 Stock Incentive Plan on April 30, 2015. This plan is intended to provide incentives which will attract and retain highly competent persons at all levels as employees of the Company, as well as independent contractors providing consulting or advisory services to the Company, by providing them opportunities to acquire the Company’s common stock or to receive monetary payments based on the value of such shares pursuant to Awards issued. The 2015 Plan permits the grant of options and shares for up to 5,000,000 shares. In addition, there is a provision for an annual increase of 15% to the shares included under the plan, with the shares to be added on the first day of each calendar year, beginning on January 1, 2017. Under the 2015 Stock Incentive Plan, the Company has issued options to purchase approximately 4.47 million shares at an average price of $3.80 with a fair value of $5.34 million. For the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company issued options to purchase 1.83 million and 1.2 million shares. For the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized an expense of approximately $4.3 million and $2.2 million, respectively, of non-cash compensation expense (included in General and Administrative expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations) determined by application of a Black Scholes option pricing model with the following inputs: exercise price, dividend yields, risk-free interest rate, and expected annual volatility. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately $7,334,000 of unrecognized pre-tax non-cash compensation expense, which the Company expects to recognize, based on a weighted-average period of 3 years. The Company used straight-line amortization of compensation expense over the two to three-year requisite service or vesting period of the grant. There are options to purchase approximately 3.06 million shares that have vested as of December 31, 2018. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of its stock option awards and warrant issuances. The calculation of the fair value of the awards using the Black - Scholes option-pricing model is affected by the Company’s stock price on the date of grant as well as assumptions regarding the following: F- 21 Celsius Holdings, Inc. Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2018 The expected volatility was determined with reference to the historical volatility of the Company’s stock. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination within the valuation model. The expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury rate in effect at the time of grant. A summary of the status of the Company’s outstanding stock options as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 and changes during the period ending on that date is as follows: The following table summarizes information about employee stock options outstanding at December 31, 2018: F- 22 Celsius Holdings, Inc.

(“Statewide”), a former distributor of the Company’s products, whose distribution agreement, with the Company had terminated effective November 2016 for “cause” (non-payment of invoices within the applicable grace period provided in the distribution agreement). The complaint alleged that the distribution agreement was terminated without “cause” and sought unspecified damages consisting of termination payments and fees which would be due upon a termination without “cause,” but not on a termination for “cause” as well as certain invasion fees allegedly due under the terms of the distribution agreement. The Company settled this case as of July 19, 2018 for three cash payments over a five (5) month period through January 1, 2019 totaling $750,000 and the issuance of 60,000 restricted shares of our common stock, valued at $4.66 per share. Accordingly, the total impact of this settlement amounted to $1,029,600. In addition to the foregoing, from time to time, we may become party to litigation or other legal proceedings that we consider to be a part of the ordinary course of our business. The Company has entered into distribution agreements with liquidated damages in case the Company cancels the distribution agreements without cause. Cause has been defined in various ways. It is management’s belief that no such agreement has created any liability as of December 31, 2018. The Company entered into an office lease with a related party (see note 11) effective October 2015.
