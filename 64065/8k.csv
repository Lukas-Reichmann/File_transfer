Most importantly, we're bringing CRM, data, AI and trust together in a single, integrated platform, leading our customers into a new era of incredible productivity and growth.” “Over the last year we have transformed the company, enabling us to deliver another quarter of strong profitable growth with GAAP operating margin of 17.2% and non-GAAP operating margin of 31.2%,” said Amy Weaver, President and CFO of Salesforce. “We remain focused on driving shareholder value as we deliver innovation to our customers as the #1 AI CRM.” Salesforce delivered the following results for its fiscal third quarter: Revenue : Total third quarter revenue was $8.72 billion, an increase of 11% Y/Y and 10% CC.

Earnings per Share : Third quarter GAAP diluted EPS was $1.25, and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $2.11.

Current remaining performance obligation ended at $23.9 billion, an increase of 14% Y/Y, and 13% CC. Forward Looking Guidance As of November 29, 2023, the Company is initiating its fourth quarter GAAP and non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance, current remaining performance obligation growth guidance, and revenue guidance. The Company is updating its full year FY24 revenue guidance and raising its GAAP and non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance, GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin guidance, and operating cash flow growth guidance. Our guidance assumes no change to the value of the Company's strategic investment portfolio as it is not possible to forecast future gains and losses. In addition, the guidance below is based on estimated GAAP tax rates that reflect the Company’s currently available information, and excludes forecasted discrete tax items such as excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. The GAAP tax rates may fluctuate due to discrete tax items and related effects in conjunction with certain provisions in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, future acquisitions or other transactions. Q4 FY24 Guidance Full Year FY24 Guidance Revenue $9.18 - $9.23 Billion $34.75 - $34.8 Billion Y/Y Growth 10% 11% FX Impact (1) No impact ($50M) Y/Y FX GAAP Operating Margin N/A 14.5% Non-GAAP Operating Margin (2) N/A 30.5% GAAP Diluted Earnings per Share (2) $1.26 - $1.27 $3.99 - $4.00 Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings per Share (2) $2.25 - $2.26 $8.18 - $8.19 Operating Cash Flow Growth (Y/Y) (3) N/A 30% - 33% Current Remaining Performance Obligation Growth (Y/Y) 10% N/A FX Impact (4) (~1 pt) N/A (1) Revenue FX impact is calculated by taking the current period rates compared to the prior period average rates. (2) Non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. See below for an explanation of non-GAAP financial measures. The Company's shares used in computing GAAP Diluted EPS guidance and non-GAAP Diluted EPS guidance excludes any impact to share count from potential Q4 FY24 repurchase activity under our share repurchase program. (3) Operating Cash Flow Growth guidance includes an estimated 14% - 16% headwind from charges associated with our restructuring plan announced on January 4, 2023 (the ""Restructuring Plan""). (4) Current Remaining Performance Obligation FX impact is calculated by taking the current period rates compared to the prior period ending rates. The following is a reconciliation of GAAP operating margin guidance to non-GAAP operating margin guidance for the full year: Full Year FY24 Guidance GAAP operating margin (1) ~14.5% Plus Amortization of purchased intangibles (2) 5.4% Stock-based compensation expense (2)(3) 8.0% Restructuring (2)(3) 2.6% Non-GAAP operating margin (1) ~30.5% (1) GAAP operating margin is the proportion of GAAP income from operations as a percentage of GAAP revenue. Non-GAAP operating margin is the proportion of non-GAAP income from operations as a percentage of GAAP revenue. (2) The percentages shown above have been calculated based on the midpoint of the low and high ends of the revenue guidance for full year FY24. (3) The percentages shown in the restructuring line have been calculated based on charges associated with the Restructuring Plan. Stock-based compensation expense included in the full year FY24 guidance GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation table excludes stock-based compensation expense related to the Restructuring Plan, which is included in the restructuring line. The following is a per share reconciliation of GAAP diluted EPS to non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance for the next quarter and the full year: Fiscal 2024 Q4 FY24 GAAP diluted earnings per share range (1)(2) $1.26 - $1.27 $3.99 - $4.00 Plus Amortization of purchased intangibles $ 0.47 $ 1.90 Stock-based compensation expense $ 0.69 $ 2.82 Restructuring (3) $ 0.09 $ 0.91 Less Income tax effects and adjustments (4) $ (0.26) $ (1.44) Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (2) $2.25 - $2.26 $8.18 - $8.19 Shares used in computing basic net income per share (millions) (5) 973 975 Shares used in computing diluted net income per share (millions) (5) 984 985 (1) The Company's GAAP tax provision is expected to be approximately 26% for the three months ended January 31, 2024, and approximately 21% for the year ended January 31, 2024. The GAAP tax rates may fluctuate due to discrete tax items and related effects in conjunction with certain provisions in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, future acquisitions or other transactions. (2) The Company's projected GAAP and non-GAAP diluted EPS assumes no change to the value of our strategic investment portfolio as it is not possible to forecast future gains and losses. The impact of future gains or losses from the Company’s strategic investment portfolio could be material. (3) The estimated impact to GAAP diluted EPS is in connection with the Restructuring Plan. (4) The Company’s non-GAAP tax provision uses a long-term projected tax rate of 23.5%, which reflects currently available information and could be subject to change. (5) The Company's shares used in computing GAAP EPS guidance and non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes any impact to share count from Q4 FY24 repurchase activity under our share repurchase program. For additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures see the reconciliation of results and related explanations below. Management will provide further commentary around these guidance assumptions on its earnings call.

RPO is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the timing of renewals, the timing of software license deliveries, average contract terms and foreign currency exchange rates. Remaining performance obligation is also impacted by acquisitions. Unbilled portions of RPO denominated in foreign currencies are revalued each period based on the period end exchange rates. The portion of RPO that is unbilled is not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets.

These non-GAAP financial measures are measurements of financial performance that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and computational methods may differ from those used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP measures when planning, monitoring and evaluating the Company’s performance. The primary purpose of using non-GAAP measures is to provide supplemental information that may prove useful to investors and to enable investors to evaluate the Company’s results in the same way management does. Management believes that supplementing GAAP disclosure with non-GAAP disclosure provides investors with a more complete view of the Company’s operational performance and allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in the Company’s business. Further to the extent that other companies use similar methods in calculating non-GAAP measures, the provision of supplemental non-GAAP information can allow for a comparison of the Company’s relative performance against other companies that also report non-GAAP operating results. Non-GAAP Operating Margin is the proportion of non-GAAP income from operations as a percentage of GAAP revenue. Non-GAAP income from operations excludes the impact of the following items: stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, and charges related to the Restructuring Plan. Non-GAAP operating margin for Q1 FY25 reflects our operating priorities, not specific guidance. A reconciliation of non-GAAP operating margin for Q1 FY25 is not available without unreasonable efforts and has been omitted in accordance with SEC rules. Non-GAAP earnings per share excludes, to the extent applicable, the impact of the following items: stock-based compensation expense, amortization of purchased intangibles, charges related to the Restructuring Plan, and income tax adjustments. These items are excluded because the decisions that give rise to them are not made to increase revenue in a particular period, but instead for the Company’s long-term benefit over multiple periods. As described above, the Company excludes or adjusts for the following in its non-GAAP results and guidance: • Stock-Based Compensation Expense: The Company’s compensation strategy includes the use of stock-based compensation expense to attract and retain employees and executives. It is principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of our stockholders and at long-term employee retention, rather than to motivate or reward operational performance for any particular period. Thus, stock-based compensation expense varies for reasons that are generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period. • Amortization of Purchased Intangibles: The Company views amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s research and development efforts, trade names, customer lists and customer relationships, and in some cases, acquired lease intangibles, as items arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. While these intangible assets are continually evaluated for impairment, amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is a static expense, which is not typically affected by operations during any particular period. Although the Company excludes the amortization of purchased intangibles from these non-GAAP measures, management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation. • Restructuring: Restructuring charges are costs associated with a formal restructuring plan and may include employee notice period costs and severance payments, lease or contract termination costs, asset impairments, accelerated depreciation and amortization, and other related expenses. The Company excludes these restructuring charges because they are distinct from ongoing operational costs and it does not believe they are reflective of current and expected future business performance and operating results. • Gains on Strategic Investments, net: The Company records all fair value adjustments to its equity securities held within the strategic investment portfolio through the statement of operations. As it is not possible to forecast future gains and losses, the Company assumes no change to the value of its strategic investment portfolio in its GAAP and non-GAAP estimates for future periods, including its guidance. Gains on Strategic Investments, net, are included in its GAAP financial statements. • Income Tax Effects and Adjustments: The Company utilizes a fixed long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate in order to provide better consistency across the interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of items such as changes in the tax valuation allowance and tax effects of acquisition-related costs, since each of these can vary in size and frequency. When projecting this long-term rate, the Company evaluated a three-year financial projection that excludes the direct impact of the following non-cash items: stock-based expenses and the amortization of purchased intangibles. The projected rate also considers factors including the Company’s expected tax structure, its tax positions in various jurisdictions and key legislation in major jurisdictions where the Company operates. For fiscal 2023, the Company used a projected non-GAAP tax rate 22.0%. For fiscal 2024, the Company uses a projected non-GAAP tax rate of 23.5%, which reflects currently available information, as well as other factors and assumptions. The non-GAAP tax rate could be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in the Company’s geographic earnings mix due to acquisition activity, or other changes to the Company’s strategy or business operations. The Company will re-evaluate its long-term rate as appropriate. The Company presents constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how the Company's underlying business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. To present constant currency revenue growth rates, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars are converted into United States dollars at the weighted average exchange rate for the quarter being compared to rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during that period. To present current remaining performance obligation growth rates on a constant currency basis, current remaining performance obligation balances in local currencies in previous comparable periods are converted using the United States dollar currency exchange rate as of the most recent balance sheet date. The Company defines the non-GAAP measure free cash flow as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures. -;-",0001108524,CRM,"8-K:8-K 1 crm-20231129.htm 8-K crm-20231129 0001108524 FALSE 0001108524 2023-11-29 2023-11-29 UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Washington, D.C. 20549 ________________________________________________________ FORM 8-K ________________________________________________________ CURRENT REPORT Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 November 29, 2023 Date of Report (date of earliest event reported) _________________________________________________________ Salesforce, Inc.

Forward Looking Guidance As of November 29, 2023, the Company is initiating its fourth quarter GAAP and non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance, current remaining performance obligation growth guidance, and revenue guidance. The Company is updating its full year FY24 revenue guidance and raising its GAAP and non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance, GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin guidance, and operating cash flow growth guidance. Our guidance assumes no change to the value of the Company's strategic investment portfolio as it is not possible to forecast future gains and losses. In addition, the guidance below is based on estimated GAAP tax rates that reflect the Company’s currently available information, and excludes forecasted discrete tax items such as excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. The GAAP tax rates may fluctuate due to discrete tax items and related effects in conjunction with certain provisions in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, future acquisitions or other transactions. Q4 FY24 Guidance Full Year FY24 Guidance Revenue $9.18 - $9.23 Billion $34.75 - $34.8 Billion Y/Y Growth 10% 11% FX Impact (1) No impact ($50M) Y/Y FX GAAP Operating Margin N/A 14.5% Non-GAAP Operating Margin (2) N/A 30.5% GAAP Diluted Earnings per Share (2) $1.26 - $1.27 $3.99 - $4.00 Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings per Share (2) $2.25 - $2.26 $8.18 - $8.19 Operating Cash Flow Growth (Y/Y) (3) N/A 30% - 33% Current Remaining Performance Obligation Growth (Y/Y) 10% N/A FX Impact (4) (~1 pt) N/A (1) Revenue FX impact is calculated by taking the current period rates compared to the prior period average rates. (2) Non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. See below for an explanation of non-GAAP financial measures. The Company's shares used in computing GAAP Diluted EPS guidance and non-GAAP Diluted EPS guidance excludes any impact to share count from potential Q4 FY24 repurchase activity under our share repurchase program. (3) Operating Cash Flow Growth guidance includes an estimated 14% - 16% headwind from charges associated with our restructuring plan announced on January 4, 2023 (the ""Restructuring Plan""). (4) Current Remaining Performance Obligation FX impact is calculated by taking the current period rates compared to the prior period ending rates. The following is a reconciliation of GAAP operating margin guidance to non-GAAP operating margin guidance for the full year: Full Year FY24 Guidance GAAP operating margin (1) ~14.5% Plus Amortization of purchased intangibles (2) 5.4% Stock-based compensation expense (2)(3) 8.0% Restructuring (2)(3) 2.6% Non-GAAP operating margin (1) ~30.5% (1) GAAP operating margin is the proportion of GAAP income from operations as a percentage of GAAP revenue. Non-GAAP operating margin is the proportion of non-GAAP income from operations as a percentage of GAAP revenue. (2) The percentages shown above have been calculated based on the midpoint of the low and high ends of the revenue guidance for full year FY24. (3) The percentages shown in the restructuring line have been calculated based on charges associated with the Restructuring Plan. Stock-based compensation expense included in the full year FY24 guidance GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation table excludes stock-based compensation expense related to the Restructuring Plan, which is included in the restructuring line. The following is a per share reconciliation of GAAP diluted EPS to non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance for the next quarter and the full year: Fiscal 2024 Q4 FY24 GAAP diluted earnings per share range (1)(2) $1.26 - $1.27 $3.99 - $4.00 Plus Amortization of purchased intangibles $ 0.47 $ 1.90 Stock-based compensation expense $ 0.69 $ 2.82 Restructuring (3) $ 0.09 $ 0.91 Less Income tax effects and adjustments (4) $ (0.26) $ (1.44) Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (2) $2.25 - $2.26 $8.18 - $8.19 Shares used in computing basic net income per share (millions) (5) 973 975 Shares used in computing diluted net income per share (millions) (5) 984 985 (1) The Company's GAAP tax provision is expected to be approximately 26% for the three months ended January 31, 2024, and approximately 21% for the year ended January 31, 2024. The GAAP tax rates may fluctuate due to discrete tax items and related effects in conjunction with certain provisions in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, future acquisitions or other transactions. (2) The Company's projected GAAP and non-GAAP diluted EPS assumes no change to the value of our strategic investment portfolio as it is not possible to forecast future gains and losses. The impact of future gains or losses from the Company’s strategic investment portfolio could be material. (3) The estimated impact to GAAP diluted EPS is in connection with the Restructuring Plan. (4) The Company’s non-GAAP tax provision uses a long-term projected tax rate of 23.5%, which reflects currently available information and could be subject to change. (5) The Company's shares used in computing GAAP EPS guidance and non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes any impact to share count from Q4 FY24 repurchase activity under our share repurchase program. For additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures see the reconciliation of results and related explanations below. Management will provide further commentary around these guidance assumptions on its earnings call.

These non-GAAP financial measures are measurements of financial performance that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and computational methods may differ from those used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP measures when planning, monitoring and evaluating the Company’s performance. The primary purpose of using non-GAAP measures is to provide supplemental information that may prove useful to investors and to enable investors to evaluate the Company’s results in the same way management does. Management believes that supplementing GAAP disclosure with non-GAAP disclosure provides investors with a more complete view of the Company’s operational performance and allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in the Company’s business. Further to the extent that other companies use similar methods in calculating non-GAAP measures, the provision of supplemental non-GAAP information can allow for a comparison of the Company’s relative performance against other companies that also report non-GAAP operating results. Non-GAAP Operating Margin is the proportion of non-GAAP income from operations as a percentage of GAAP revenue. Non-GAAP income from operations excludes the impact of the following items: stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, and charges related to the Restructuring Plan. Non-GAAP operating margin for Q1 FY25 reflects our operating priorities, not specific guidance. A reconciliation of non-GAAP operating margin for Q1 FY25 is not available without unreasonable efforts and has been omitted in accordance with SEC rules. Non-GAAP earnings per share excludes, to the extent applicable, the impact of the following items: stock-based compensation expense, amortization of purchased intangibles, charges related to the Restructuring Plan, and income tax adjustments. These items are excluded because the decisions that give rise to them are not made to increase revenue in a particular period, but instead for the Company’s long-term benefit over multiple periods. As described above, the Company excludes or adjusts for the following in its non-GAAP results and guidance: • Stock-Based Compensation Expense: The Company’s compensation strategy includes the use of stock-based compensation expense to attract and retain employees and executives. It is principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of our stockholders and at long-term employee retention, rather than to motivate or reward operational performance for any particular period. Thus, stock-based compensation expense varies for reasons that are generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period. • Amortization of Purchased Intangibles: The Company views amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s research and development efforts, trade names, customer lists and customer relationships, and in some cases, acquired lease intangibles, as items arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. While these intangible assets are continually evaluated for impairment, amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is a static expense, which is not typically affected by operations during any particular period. Although the Company excludes the amortization of purchased intangibles from these non-GAAP measures, management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation. • Restructuring: Restructuring charges are costs associated with a formal restructuring plan and may include employee notice period costs and severance payments, lease or contract termination costs, asset impairments, accelerated depreciation and amortization, and other related expenses. The Company excludes these restructuring charges because they are distinct from ongoing operational costs and it does not believe they are reflective of current and expected future business performance and operating results. • Gains on Strategic Investments, net: The Company records all fair value adjustments to its equity securities held within the strategic investment portfolio through the statement of operations. As it is not possible to forecast future gains and losses, the Company assumes no change to the value of its strategic investment portfolio in its GAAP and non-GAAP estimates for future periods, including its guidance. Gains on Strategic Investments, net, are included in its GAAP financial statements. • Income Tax Effects and Adjustments: The Company utilizes a fixed long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate in order to provide better consistency across the interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of items such as changes in the tax valuation allowance and tax effects of acquisition-related costs, since each of these can vary in size and frequency. When projecting this long-term rate, the Company evaluated a three-year financial projection that excludes the direct impact of the following non-cash items: stock-based expenses and the amortization of purchased intangibles. The projected rate also considers factors including the Company’s expected tax structure, its tax positions in various jurisdictions and key legislation in major jurisdictions where the Company operates. For fiscal 2023, the Company used a projected non-GAAP tax rate 22.0%. For fiscal 2024, the Company uses a projected non-GAAP tax rate of 23.5%, which reflects currently available information, as well as other factors and assumptions. The non-GAAP tax rate could be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in the Company’s geographic earnings mix due to acquisition activity, or other changes to the Company’s strategy or business operations. The Company will re-evaluate its long-term rate as appropriate. The Company presents constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how the Company's underlying business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. To present constant currency revenue growth rates, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars are converted into United States dollars at the weighted average exchange rate for the quarter being compared to rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during that period. To present current remaining performance obligation growth rates on a constant currency basis, current remaining performance obligation balances in local currencies in previous comparable periods are converted using the United States dollar currency exchange rate as of the most recent balance sheet date. The Company defines the non-GAAP measure free cash flow as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures. "

Forward Looking Guidance As of August 30, 2023, the Company is initiating its third quarter GAAP and non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance, current remaining performance obligation growth guidance, and revenue guidance. The Company is raising its full year FY24 revenue guidance, GAAP and non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance, GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin guidance, and operating cash flow growth guidance. Our guidance assumes no change to the value of the Company's strategic investment portfolio as it is not possible to forecast future gains and losses. In addition, the guidance below is based on estimated GAAP tax rates that reflect the Company’s currently available information, and excludes forecasted discrete tax items such as excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. The GAAP tax rates may fluctuate due to discrete tax items and related effects in conjunction with certain provisions in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, future acquisitions or other transactions. Q3 FY24 Guidance Full Year FY24 Guidance Revenue $8.70 - $8.72 Billion $34.7 - $34.8 Billion Y/Y Growth ~11% ~11% FX Impact (1) $100M Y/Y FX no impact GAAP Operating Margin N/A ~13.3% Non-GAAP Operating Margin (2) N/A ~30.0% GAAP Diluted Earnings per Share (2) $1.02 - $1.03 $3.50 - $3.52 Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings per Share (2) $2.05 - $2.06 $8.04 - $8.06 Operating Cash Flow Growth (Y/Y) (3) N/A 22% - 23% Current Remaining Performance Obligation Growth (Y/Y) Slightly above 11% N/A FX Impact (4) ~1 pt N/A (1) Revenue FX impact is calculated by taking the current period rates compared to the prior period average rates. (2) Non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. See below for an explanation of non-GAAP financial measures. The Company's shares used in computing GAAP Diluted EPS guidance and Non-GAAP Diluted EPS guidance excludes any impact to share count from potential Q3 - Q4 FY24 repurchase activity under our share repurchase program. (3) Operating Cash Flow Growth guidance includes an estimated 14% - 16% headwind associated with charges from restructuring. (4) Current Remaining Performance Obligation FX impact is calculated by taking the current period rates compared to the prior period ending rates. The following is a reconciliation of GAAP operating margin guidance to non-GAAP operating margin guidance for the full year: Full Year FY24 Guidance GAAP operating margin (1) ~13.3% Plus Amortization of purchased intangibles (2) 5.4% Stock-based compensation expense (2) 8.1% Restructuring (2)(3) 3.2% Non-GAAP operating margin (1) ~30.0% (1) GAAP operating margin is the proportion of GAAP income from operations as a percentage of GAAP revenue. Non-GAAP operating margin is the proportion of non-GAAP income from operations as a percentage of GAAP revenue. (2) The percentages shown above have been calculated based on the midpoint of the low and high ends of the revenue guidance for full year FY24. (3) The percentages shown above have been calculated based on the high end of the estimated charges in connection with our restructuring plan announced on January 4, 2023 (the ""Restructuring Plan""). The following is a per share reconciliation of GAAP diluted EPS to non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance for the next quarter and the full year: Fiscal 2024 Q3 FY24 GAAP diluted earnings per share range (1)(2) $1.02 - $1.03 $3.50 - $3.52 Plus Amortization of purchased intangibles $ 0.47 $ 1.89 Stock-based compensation expense $ 0.71 $ 2.84 Restructuring (3) $ 0.10 $ 1.11 Less Income tax effects and adjustments (4) $ (0.25) $ (1.30) Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (2) $2.05 - $2.06 $8.04 - $8.06 Shares used in computing basic net income per share (millions) (5) 978 979 Shares used in computing diluted net income per share (millions) (5) 987 988 (1) The Company's GAAP tax provision is expected to be approximately 27% for the three months ended October 31, 2023, and approximately 25% for the year ended January 31, 2024. The GAAP tax rates may fluctuate due to discrete tax items and related effects in conjunction with certain provisions in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, future acquisitions or other transactions. (2) The Company's projected GAAP and Non-GAAP diluted EPS assumes no change to the value of our strategic investment portfolio as it is not possible to forecast future gains and losses. The impact of future gains or losses from the company’s strategic investment portfolio could be material. (3) The estimated impact to GAAP diluted EPS has been calculated based on the high end of the estimated charges in connection with the Restructuring Plan. (4) The Company’s Non-GAAP tax provision uses a long-term projected tax rate of 23.5%, which reflects currently available information and could be subject to change. (5) The Company's shares used in computing GAAP EPS guidance and Non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes any impact to share count from Q3 - Q4 FY24 repurchase activity under our share repurchase program. For additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures see the reconciliation of results and related explanations below. Management will provide further commentary around these guidance assumptions on its earnings call.

These non-GAAP financial measures are measurements of financial performance that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and computational methods may differ from those used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP measures when planning, monitoring and evaluating the Company’s performance. The primary purpose of using non-GAAP measures is to provide supplemental information that may prove useful to investors and to enable investors to evaluate the Company’s results in the same way management does. Management believes that supplementing GAAP disclosure with non-GAAP disclosure provides investors with a more complete view of the Company’s operational performance and allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in the Company’s business. Further to the extent that other companies use similar methods in calculating non-GAAP measures, the provision of supplemental non-GAAP information can allow for a comparison of the Company’s relative performance against other companies that also report non-GAAP operating results. Non-GAAP Operating Margin is the proportion of non-GAAP income from operations as a percentage of GAAP revenue. Non-GAAP income from operations excludes the impact of the following items: stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, and charges related to the Restructuring Plan. Non-GAAP operating margin for Q1 FY25 reflects our operating priorities, not specific guidance. A reconciliation of non-GAAP operating margin for Q1 FY25 is not available without unreasonable efforts and has been omitted in accordance with SEC rules. Non-GAAP earnings per share excludes, to the extent applicable, the impact of the following items: stock-based compensation expense, amortization of purchased intangibles, charges related to the Restructuring Plan, and income tax adjustments. These items are excluded because the decisions that give rise to them are not made to increase revenue in a particular period, but instead for the Company’s long-term benefit over multiple periods. As described above, the Company excludes or adjusts for the following in its non-GAAP results and guidance: • Stock-Based Compensation Expense: The Company’s compensation strategy includes the use of stock-based compensation expense to attract and retain employees and executives. It is principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of our stockholders and at long-term employee retention, rather than to motivate or reward operational performance for any particular period. Thus, stock-based compensation expense varies for reasons that are generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period. • Amortization of Purchased Intangibles: The Company views amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired Company’s research and development efforts, trade names, customer lists and customer relationships, and in some cases, acquired lease intangibles, as items arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. While these intangible assets are continually evaluated for impairment, amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is a static expense, which is not typically affected by operations during any particular period. Although the Company excludes the amortization of purchased intangibles from these non-GAAP measures, management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation. • Restructuring: Restructuring charges are costs associated with a formal restructuring plan and may include employee notice period costs and severance payments, lease or contract termination costs, asset impairments, accelerated depreciation and amortization, and other related expenses. The Company excludes these restructuring charges because they are distinct from ongoing operational costs and it does not believe they are reflective of current and expected future business performance and operating results. • Gains on Strategic Investments, net: The Company records all fair value adjustments to its equity securities held within the strategic investment portfolio through the statement of operations. As it is not possible to forecast future gains and losses, the Company assumes no change to the value of its strategic investment portfolio in its GAAP and non-GAAP estimates for future periods, including its guidance. Gains on Strategic Investments, net, are included in its GAAP financial statements. • Income Tax Effects and Adjustments: The Company utilizes a fixed long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate in order to provide better consistency across the interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of items such as changes in the tax valuation allowance and tax effects of acquisition-related costs, since each of these can vary in size and frequency. When projecting this long-term rate, the Company evaluated a three-year financial projection that excludes the direct impact of the following non-cash items: stock-based expenses and the amortization of purchased intangibles. The projected rate also considers factors including the Company’s expected tax structure, its tax positions in various jurisdictions and key legislation in major jurisdictions where the Company operates. For fiscal 2023, the Company used a projected non-GAAP tax rate 22.0%. For fiscal 2024, the Company uses a projected non-GAAP tax rate of 23.5%, which reflects currently available information, as well as other factors and assumptions. The non-GAAP tax rate could be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in the Company’s geographic earnings mix due to acquisition activity, or other changes to the Company’s strategy or business operations. The Company will re-evaluate its long-term rate as appropriate. The Company presents constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how the Company's underlying business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. To present constant currency revenue growth rates, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars are converted into United States dollars at the weighted average exchange rate for the quarter being compared to rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during that period. To present current remaining performance obligation growth rates on a constant currency basis, current remaining performance obligation balances in local currencies in previous comparable periods are converted using the United States dollar currency exchange rate as of the most recent balance sheet date. The Company defines the non-GAAP measure free cash flow as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures. -;-",0001108524,CRM,"8-K:8-K 1 crm-20230830.htm 8-K crm-20230830 0001108524 FALSE 0001108524 2023-08-30 2023-08-30 UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Washington, D.C. 20549 ________________________________________________________ FORM 8-K ________________________________________________________ CURRENT REPORT Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 August 30, 2023 Date of Report (date of earliest event reported) _________________________________________________________ Salesforce, Inc.

Forward Looking Guidance As of August 30, 2023, the Company is initiating its third quarter GAAP and non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance, current remaining performance obligation growth guidance, and revenue guidance. The Company is raising its full year FY24 revenue guidance, GAAP and non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance, GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin guidance, and operating cash flow growth guidance. Our guidance assumes no change to the value of the Company's strategic investment portfolio as it is not possible to forecast future gains and losses. In addition, the guidance below is based on estimated GAAP tax rates that reflect the Company’s currently available information, and excludes forecasted discrete tax items such as excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. The GAAP tax rates may fluctuate due to discrete tax items and related effects in conjunction with certain provisions in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, future acquisitions or other transactions. Q3 FY24 Guidance Full Year FY24 Guidance Revenue $8.70 - $8.72 Billion $34.7 - $34.8 Billion Y/Y Growth ~11% ~11% FX Impact (1) $100M Y/Y FX no impact GAAP Operating Margin N/A ~13.3% Non-GAAP Operating Margin (2) N/A ~30.0% GAAP Diluted Earnings per Share (2) $1.02 - $1.03 $3.50 - $3.52 Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings per Share (2) $2.05 - $2.06 $8.04 - $8.06 Operating Cash Flow Growth (Y/Y) (3) N/A 22% - 23% Current Remaining Performance Obligation Growth (Y/Y) Slightly above 11% N/A FX Impact (4) ~1 pt N/A (1) Revenue FX impact is calculated by taking the current period rates compared to the prior period average rates. (2) Non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. See below for an explanation of non-GAAP financial measures. The Company's shares used in computing GAAP Diluted EPS guidance and Non-GAAP Diluted EPS guidance excludes any impact to share count from potential Q3 - Q4 FY24 repurchase activity under our share repurchase program. (3) Operating Cash Flow Growth guidance includes an estimated 14% - 16% headwind associated with charges from restructuring. (4) Current Remaining Performance Obligation FX impact is calculated by taking the current period rates compared to the prior period ending rates. The following is a reconciliation of GAAP operating margin guidance to non-GAAP operating margin guidance for the full year: Full Year FY24 Guidance GAAP operating margin (1) ~13.3% Plus Amortization of purchased intangibles (2) 5.4% Stock-based compensation expense (2) 8.1% Restructuring (2)(3) 3.2% Non-GAAP operating margin (1) ~30.0% (1) GAAP operating margin is the proportion of GAAP income from operations as a percentage of GAAP revenue. Non-GAAP operating margin is the proportion of non-GAAP income from operations as a percentage of GAAP revenue. (2) The percentages shown above have been calculated based on the midpoint of the low and high ends of the revenue guidance for full year FY24. (3) The percentages shown above have been calculated based on the high end of the estimated charges in connection with our restructuring plan announced on January 4, 2023 (the ""Restructuring Plan""). The following is a per share reconciliation of GAAP diluted EPS to non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance for the next quarter and the full year: Fiscal 2024 Q3 FY24 GAAP diluted earnings per share range (1)(2) $1.02 - $1.03 $3.50 - $3.52 Plus Amortization of purchased intangibles $ 0.47 $ 1.89 Stock-based compensation expense $ 0.71 $ 2.84 Restructuring (3) $ 0.10 $ 1.11 Less Income tax effects and adjustments (4) $ (0.25) $ (1.30) Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (2) $2.05 - $2.06 $8.04 - $8.06 Shares used in computing basic net income per share (millions) (5) 978 979 Shares used in computing diluted net income per share (millions) (5) 987 988 (1) The Company's GAAP tax provision is expected to be approximately 27% for the three months ended October 31, 2023, and approximately 25% for the year ended January 31, 2024. The GAAP tax rates may fluctuate due to discrete tax items and related effects in conjunction with certain provisions in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, future acquisitions or other transactions. (2) The Company's projected GAAP and Non-GAAP diluted EPS assumes no change to the value of our strategic investment portfolio as it is not possible to forecast future gains and losses. The impact of future gains or losses from the company’s strategic investment portfolio could be material. (3) The estimated impact to GAAP diluted EPS has been calculated based on the high end of the estimated charges in connection with the Restructuring Plan. (4) The Company’s Non-GAAP tax provision uses a long-term projected tax rate of 23.5%, which reflects currently available information and could be subject to change. (5) The Company's shares used in computing GAAP EPS guidance and Non-GAAP EPS guidance excludes any impact to share count from Q3 - Q4 FY24 repurchase activity under our share repurchase program. For additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures see the reconciliation of results and related explanations below. Management will provide further commentary around these guidance assumptions on its earnings call.

RPO is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the timing of renewals, the timing of software license deliveries, average contract terms and foreign currency exchange rates. Remaining performance obligation is also impacted by acquisitions. Unbilled portions of RPO denominated in foreign currencies are revalued each period based on the period end exchange rates. The portion of RPO that is unbilled is not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets.

These non-GAAP financial measures are measurements of financial performance that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and computational methods may differ from those used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP measures when planning, monitoring and evaluating the Company’s performance. The primary purpose of using non-GAAP measures is to provide supplemental information that may prove useful to investors and to enable investors to evaluate the Company’s results in the same way management does. Management believes that supplementing GAAP disclosure with non-GAAP disclosure provides investors with a more complete view of the Company’s operational performance and allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in the Company’s business. Further to the extent that other companies use similar methods in calculating non-GAAP measures, the provision of supplemental non-GAAP information can allow for a comparison of the Company’s relative performance against other companies that also report non-GAAP operating results. Non-GAAP Operating Margin is the proportion of non-GAAP income from operations as a percentage of GAAP revenue. Non-GAAP income from operations excludes the impact of the following items: stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, and charges related to the Restructuring Plan. Non-GAAP operating margin for Q1 FY25 reflects our operating priorities, not specific guidance. A reconciliation of non-GAAP operating margin for Q1 FY25 is not available without unreasonable efforts and has been omitted in accordance with SEC rules. Non-GAAP earnings per share excludes, to the extent applicable, the impact of the following items: stock-based compensation expense, amortization of purchased intangibles, charges related to the Restructuring Plan, and income tax adjustments. These items are excluded because the decisions that give rise to them are not made to increase revenue in a particular period, but instead for the Company’s long-term benefit over multiple periods. As described above, the Company excludes or adjusts for the following in its non-GAAP results and guidance: • Stock-Based Compensation Expense: The Company’s compensation strategy includes the use of stock-based compensation expense to attract and retain employees and executives. It is principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of our stockholders and at long-term employee retention, rather than to motivate or reward operational performance for any particular period. Thus, stock-based compensation expense varies for reasons that are generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period. • Amortization of Purchased Intangibles: The Company views amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired Company’s research and development efforts, trade names, customer lists and customer relationships, and in some cases, acquired lease intangibles, as items arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. While these intangible assets are continually evaluated for impairment, amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is a static expense, which is not typically affected by operations during any particular period. Although the Company excludes the amortization of purchased intangibles from these non-GAAP measures, management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation. • Restructuring: Restructuring charges are costs associated with a formal restructuring plan and may include employee notice period costs and severance payments, lease or contract termination costs, asset impairments, accelerated depreciation and amortization, and other related expenses. The Company excludes these restructuring charges because they are distinct from ongoing operational costs and it does not believe they are reflective of current and expected future business performance and operating results. • Gains on Strategic Investments, net: The Company records all fair value adjustments to its equity securities held within the strategic investment portfolio through the statement of operations. As it is not possible to forecast future gains and losses, the Company assumes no change to the value of its strategic investment portfolio in its GAAP and non-GAAP estimates for future periods, including its guidance. Gains on Strategic Investments, net, are included in its GAAP financial statements. • Income Tax Effects and Adjustments: The Company utilizes a fixed long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate in order to provide better consistency across the interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of items such as changes in the tax valuation allowance and tax effects of acquisition-related costs, since each of these can vary in size and frequency. When projecting this long-term rate, the Company evaluated a three-year financial projection that excludes the direct impact of the following non-cash items: stock-based expenses and the amortization of purchased intangibles. The projected rate also considers factors including the Company’s expected tax structure, its tax positions in various jurisdictions and key legislation in major jurisdictions where the Company operates. For fiscal 2023, the Company used a projected non-GAAP tax rate 22.0%. For fiscal 2024, the Company uses a projected non-GAAP tax rate of 23.5%, which reflects currently available information, as well as other factors and assumptions. The non-GAAP tax rate could be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in the Company’s geographic earnings mix due to acquisition activity, or other changes to the Company’s strategy or business operations. The Company will re-evaluate its long-term rate as appropriate. The Company presents constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how the Company's underlying business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. To present constant currency revenue growth rates, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars are converted into United States dollars at the weighted average exchange rate for the quarter being compared to rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during that period. To present current remaining performance obligation growth rates on a constant currency basis, current remaining performance obligation balances in local currencies in previous comparable periods are converted using the United States dollar currency exchange rate as of the most recent balance sheet date. The Company defines the non-GAAP measure free cash flow as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures. "

On June 24, 2019, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (“Bristol-Myers Squibb” or “Company”) issued a press release announcing an update on the regulatory approval process and timeline for the Company’s planned merger (the “Transaction”) with Celgene Corporation (“Celgene”). As further described in the press release, to allow the Transaction to close on a timely basis in light of concerns expressed by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the Company is planning the divestiture of OTEZLA® (apremilast). The divestiture is subject to further review by the FTC and requires that Bristol-Myers Squibb enter into a consent decree with the FTC. Once the FTC accepts the consent order and the other customary closing conditions are satisfied, Bristol-Myers Squibb intends to close the Transaction at the earliest possible date, which it currently expects to be at the end of 2019 or the beginning of 2020. In addition, the Company also announced that Bristol-Myers Squibb and Celgene have concluded their pre-notification process with the European Commission, and are pleased to confirm that they have today submitted the formal application for clearance by the European Commission. A copy of the press release announcing the regulatory update is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein in its entirety .

The company is evolving key aspects of its R&D and Commercialization structure to drive the continued growth of a highly successful marketed portfolio, maximize the six near-term launch opportunities and deliver the value of the combined pipeline, all guided by its continued mission of serving patients with serious disease. The business will be supported by a lean infrastructure to enable efficiency and agility. “I’m looking forward to working with this Leadership Team as we combine the strengths of Bristol-Myers Squibb and Celgene to enhance the value of our marketed portfolio, deliver six significant new product launches and realize the full potential of our deep and broad pipeline,” said Giovanni Caforio, M.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Bristol-Myers Squibb. “We are building on a strong track record of best-in-class commercial execution, industry-leading science and a culture of collaboration and innovation. Together, we will create the leading biopharma company, one that will be known for pursuing the best science to create highly innovative medicines that bring meaningful benefits to patients and value to shareholders.” Research & Development The new structure will focus on the innovation core to both companies’ success, pairing internal discovery with strong partnerships that provide access to external innovation. To deliver on the full value of its R&D capabilities, Bristol-Myers Squibb is evolving the structure and leadership around two core functional areas, Research & Early Development (R&ED) and Global Drug Development. Rupert Vessey, M.A., B.M., B.Ch., F.R.C.P., D.Phil. , will serve as President, Research & Early Development, reporting to Caforio and serving as a member of the Leadership Team.

Commercialization With nine $1 billion-plus marketed products, six near-term launch opportunities and four strengthened global franchises of Oncology, Hematology, Immunology and Cardiovascular, our combined company is well positioned for continued growth. Two experienced and proven leaders will work closely together to ensure that Bristol-Myers Squibb’s commercialization organization continues to deliver superior in-market performance and successfully launch new products, leveraging existing strong capabilities across the entire portfolio. Chris Boerner, Ph.D., will continue in his role as Executive Vice President and Chief Commercialization Officer, reporting to Caforio and serving as a member of the Leadership Team.

To deliver on the full value of its R&D capabilities, Bristol-Myers Squibb is evolving the structure and leadership around two core functional areas, Research & Early Development (R&ED) and Global Drug Development. Rupert Vessey, M.A., B.M., B.Ch., F.R.C.P., D.Phil. , will serve as President, Research & Early Development, reporting to Caforio and serving as a member of the Leadership Team. Vessey is the current President, Research & Early Development at Celgene. Under Vessey’s leadership, the R&ED organization will work as a cohesive unit across Discovery, Early Development and Translational Medicine to advance promising assets through the early pipeline. Vessey will oversee the company’s expanded range of discovery platforms to drive scientific advancements across therapeutic areas and will work closely with Business Development to identify external sources of innovation. Samit Hirawat, M.D., will join Bristol-Myers Squibb as the Chief Medical Officer, Global Drug Development, leading the development organization across therapeutic areas. Hirawat will report to Caforio and will serve as a member of the Leadership Team. Hirawat will be joining from Novartis where he was most recently Executive Vice President and Head of Oncology Development. Hirawat brings extensive experience in a range of roles in drug development. Under his leadership, the development organization will ensure progression of pipeline assets from proof-of-concept to commercialization through world-class clinical trial design and operations. Tom Lynch, M.D., will continue to serve as Executive Vice President & Chief Scientific Officer, reporting to Caforio and serving as a member of the Leadership Team until he departs the company by October 1, 2019, to pursue opportunities in healthcare. Lynch has played a significant role in evolving R&D, including enhancing the company’s translational medicine capabilities and increasing its focus on disease biology and data and analytics. “I want to thank Tom for joining the company from our Board of Directors, for his leadership as Chief Scientific Officer in building new capabilities in R&D and for his support during this period of transition,” said Caforio. Commercialization With nine $1 billion-plus marketed products, six near-term launch opportunities and four strengthened global franchises of Oncology, Hematology, Immunology and Cardiovascular, our combined company is well positioned for continued growth. Two experienced and proven leaders will work closely together to ensure that Bristol-Myers Squibb’s commercialization organization continues to deliver superior in-market performance and successfully launch new products, leveraging existing strong capabilities across the entire portfolio. Chris Boerner, Ph.D., will continue in his role as Executive Vice President and Chief Commercialization Officer, reporting to Caforio and serving as a member of the Leadership Team. Boerner is currently responsible for commercial strategy and execution for the BMS portfolio across all geographies. Following transaction close, he will assume an expanded role, overseeing the combined company’s Oncology, Immunology and Cardiovascular global businesses, Worldwide Value, Access and Pricing, and Worldwide Commercial Operations. The Global Medical organization will also report to Boerner following the transaction close. Nadim Ahmed will serve as President, Hematology, reporting to Caforio and serving as a member of the Leadership Team. Ahmed is the current President, Global Hematology & Oncology at Celgene. Following transaction close, Ahmed will oversee the company’s Hematology business including Cell Therapy. Ahmed brings deep expertise in Hematology, an area of critical importance for the combined company’s near-term success, including four potential near-term launches. Chief Financial Officer David Elkins, who is currently the Chief Financial Officer of Celgene, will be appointed the company’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, reporting to Caforio and serving as a member of the Leadership Team. Elkins has a long career in finance, including roles of increasing responsibility at Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca and as the Chief Financial Officer of Becton Dickinson. Elkins will have oversight of the Finance organization, Business Insights & Analytics and Procurement. Following transaction close, Charles Bancroft will work closely with Elkins to ensure an effective transition of all financial and operational matters. He will also continue with the company as Executive Lead for Integration, reporting to Caforio and serving as a member of the Leadership Team, until he retires from the company during 2020 after 35 years of service. Caforio commented, “I would like to thank Charlie for his extraordinary contributions during his 10 years as Chief Financial Officer and for his partnership and support. Charlie has played a significant leadership role in driving our company strategy, leading our transformation and executing important business development activities, including the acquisition of Celgene. I appreciate Charlie’s commitment to lead the integration to help make this combination a reality.” As previously announced, Caforio will continue to serve as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Company.
