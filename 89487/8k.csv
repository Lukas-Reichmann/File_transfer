Jack Plants II Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer -;-EX-99.1:EX-99.1 2 ex99-1.htm PRESS RELEASE ISSUED BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INC. ON LEADERSHIP CHANGES, DECEMBER 8, 2023 Exhibit 99.1 Financial Institutions, Inc. Announces Leadership Changes Realignment strengthens the diversified financial services company’s leadership team and streamlines organizational structure in key areas to support future growth WARSAW, N.Y., December 8, 2023 — Financial Institutions, Inc. (NASDAQ: FISI) (the “Company”), parent company of Five Star Bank (“Five Star”), SDN Insurance Agency, LLC, and Courier Capital, LLC, today announced changes to its executive leadership team and an associated realignment to strengthen its ability to execute on its long-term strategy and risk functions. Reid A. Whiting, who formerly served as Senior Vice President, Director of Indirect and Fintech Lending Solutions, was named Chief Banking Officer. This newly created position leverages Mr. Whiting’s proven track record of executing on operational efficiency and process improvement during his tenures at both Five Star and Morgan Stanley, where he had global responsibility for a range of large-scale efficiency and regulatory change initiatives . As Chief Banking Officer, he will oversee all consumer banking channels, including digital banking, the retail branch network and call center, along with consumer lending, residential mortgage and the Company’s growing Banking-as-a-Service, or BaaS, line of business. Mr. Whiting will also join the executive leadership team as a direct report of President and CEO Martin K. Birmingham . Senior Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer Blake G. Jones, a 20-year marketing and communications veteran, was also appointed to the executive leadership team, reporting directly into Mr. Birmingham and her span of control has been expanded to include enterprise sales. Her elevation to the Company’s executive ranks ensures that marketing, brand strategy and enterprise sales are aligned more closely with the Company’s long-term strategy and better positioned to support the success of Five Star and its affiliates. Additionally, several executives will assume expanded leadership responsibilities, ensuring the Company is better situated to serve its internal and external stakeholders. The Company’s operations, product, and technology areas will move under Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer W. Jack Plants II, leveraging Mr. Plants’ financial services and operational expertise. Chief Risk Officer Gary A. Pacos, who has more than 30 years of risk management experience , assumes executive oversight of all credit administration, while Chief Human Resources Officer Laurie R. Collins will now take on ownership of enterprise-wide training and incentive planning, supporting the Company’s disciplined and consistent focus on the development of talent . The Company also announced that Chief Administrative Officer Sean M. Willett is pursuing a new opportunity as CEO of an out-of-market bank and will remain with the Company through year-end to support a smooth transition of the functions he previously oversaw. In addition, Chief Community Banking Officer Justin K. Bigham has resigned. “The exciting changes announced this week position our Company to accelerate our ability to grow our digital engagement with customers while ensuring our exceptional customer-facing teams are in a strong position to provide value-added services to those we serve,” said Mr. Birmingham. “As we respond to an evolving and challenging operating environment that we expect to continue in 2024, we now can do so as a simpler, more streamlined and functional organization, where leaders across the enterprise are empowered to drive near-term success in pursuit of strong execution of long-term initiatives.” “These leadership changes leverage the strengths of our team of executives, which now includes Blake Jones and Reid Whiting. Both Blake and Reid have considerable experience in their respective areas, bring new and diverse perspectives to our leadership team, and, importantly, allow us to bring key functions closer together in a way that will better support our enterprise into the future,” Mr. Birmingham added. “I would like to also thank both Sean and Justin for their leadership and contributions to our Company. We wish them well in their future endeavors.” In conjunction with these leadership changes, the Company announced a broader restructuring that simplifies its organizational structure by reducing layers of management that no longer align with the Company’s long-term focus , positions the Company to better capitalize on data and technology expertise to further improve operational efficiencies, and supports improved process execution, while enhancing the Company’s ability to deepen customer relationships across its diversified and complimentary lines of business. The realignment impacted approximately 3.4% of the Company’s workforce and is also reflective of proactive measures to remove approximately $6 million in annual noninterest expenses that are primarily representative of salaries and benefits. Mr. Whiting joined the Company in September 2022 from Morgan Stanley, where he gained broad experience in treasury liquidity planning, regulatory affairs and compliance, most recently serving as Treasurer for Morgan Stanley’s US institutional broker dealer and global head of the recovery and resolution planning program. He earned his B.A. in Economics and Public Relations from Syracuse University’s Maxwell School of Citizenship & Public Affairs and S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications, respectively, and M.B.A. from New York University’s Leonard N. Stern School of Business. He is a member of the Consumer Bankers Association Automobile Finance Committee. Ms. Jones joined the Company in July 2023, bringing 20 years of marketing and communications experience to the growing community bank and its affiliates. Prior to joining Five Star, she served as Senior Vice President, Marketing Director for Arrow Financial Corp. Earlier in her career, Ms. Jones was a journalist and editor with publications in New York, Hawaii and California. She earned her B.A. in Mass Communications from Washington and Lee University.

Patel, Ph.D., Protagonist President and Chief Executive Officer. These maturing assets reflect our steady transition toward becoming a fully integrated company. In addition to the ongoing Phase 2 study in beta-thalassemia, we continue to explore the full potential of the hepcidin mimetic PTG-300 as one product with multiple clinical applications. We recently dosed the first patient in a Phase 2 open-label study for the potential treatment of polycythemia vera. We are on track to initiate a Phase 2 study with PTG-300 in hereditary hemochromatosis, and we expect an investigator sponsored study in myelodysplastic syndrome to begin in early 2020. In the portfolio of inflammatory bowel disease product candidates comprised of oral gut-restricted peptides, we plan to begin a Phase 2 study with the alpha-4-beta-7 integrin antagonist PN-943 in patients with ulcerative colitis in the second quarter of 2020, on the basis of a completed Phase 1 study. We also recently dosed the first patient in a Phase 2 study of oral interleukin-23 receptor antagonist PTG-200, partnered with Janssen Biotech, with results from this study expected in 2021. Finally, we continue to maintain a strong financial position, with available cash, investments and access to an established debt facility to support the development of pipeline assets through year-end 2021. Product Development and Corporate Update: PTG-300 · Preliminary Phase 2 results from the ongoing study of PTG-300 for the treatment of beta-thalassemia are expected in the fourth quarter of 2019. · An abstract relating to pre-clinical studies of hepcidin mimetic PTG-300 has been accepted for presentation at the American Society for Hematology (ASH) Annual meeting, taking place Dec. 7-10 in Orlando, Fla. · The Company is planning to initiate a Phase 2 study in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis, a third indication of development for PTG-300, by early 2020. · An investigator-sponsored study of PTG-300 in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, which represents a fourth potential indication for PTG-300, is expected to begin in early 2020. PTG-943 · Protagonist announced results from the multiple ascending dose (MAD) part of the Phase 1 study of PN-943 with two weeks of daily administration, demonstrating sustained target engagement and additional confirmation of superior target engagement as compared with the first generation oral alpha-4-beta-7 integrin antagonist PTG-100. · Clinical data from the Phase 1 study of oral alpha-4-beta-7 integrin antagonist PN-943 were presented at the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) Annual Scientific Meeting. · The Company plans to initiate a Phase 2 study of PN-943 for the treatment of ulcerative colitis in the second quarter of 2020. PTG-200 (JNJ-67864238) · Data from the Phase 1 study of PTG-200, an oral peptide IL-23 receptor antagonist partnered with Janssen Biotech, were recently presented at the United European Gastroenterology Week conference and the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) Annual Scientific Meeting. · The first patient has been dosed in a Phase 2 study of PTG-200 (also referenced as JNJ-67864238) in patients with moderate to severe Crohns disease. Protagonist Therapeutics and Janssen Biotech are jointly conducting the development of PTG-200 through completion of Phase 2 clinical proof of concept in the treatment of Crohns disease. Financing · During the third quarter of 2019, the Company issued 1.9 million shares through its at-the-market (ATM) program and raised $23.9 million, at an average price of $12.44 per share. · The Company recently announced it has entered into a four-year debt facility with MidCap Financial and Silicon Valley Bank providing access to an aggregate principal amount up to $50 million to support the ongoing Protagonist clinical development programs and related general corporate purposes. Financial Results Protagonist reported a net loss of $16.4 million and $59.7 million, respectively, for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019, as compared to a net loss of $8.7 million and $25.1 million, respectively, for the same periods of 2018. The increase in net loss for the third quarter of 2019 as compared to the prior year period was driven primarily by increased research and development (R&D) costs related to advancing its products in various clinical trials. The increase in net loss for the first nine months of 2019 as compared to the prior year period was driven primarily by the previously reported application of revenue accounting principles following the May 2019 Amendment to the Janssen collaboration agreement where the Company re-assessed overall timelines as well as re-estimated completed and remaining services, including a cumulative one-time adjustment of $9.4 million reported in the second quarter of 2019, and an increase in R&D costs related to advancing its products is various clinical trials. The net loss for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 includes non-cash stock-based compensation of $2.2 million and $6.2 million, respectively, as compared to $2.0 million and $4.8 million, respectively, for the same periods of 2018. R&D expenses for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 were $17.3 million and $49.1 million, respectively, as compared to $12.1 million and $45.2 million, respectively, for the same periods of 2018. The increases in R&D expenses were primarily due to increased clinical development costs related to PTG-300 and PN-943, offset by lower cost related to pre-clinical and discovery expenses and other clinical development expenses. General and administrative (G&A) expenses for the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 were $4.0 million and $11.6 million, respectively, as compared to $3.4 million and $10.2 million, respectively, for the same periods of 2018. The increases in G&A expenses were primarily due to increases in salaries and employee-related expenses driven by an increase in headcount and professional services expenses to support growth in operations. Protagonist ended the third quarter with $137.7 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, and $10 million of the debt facility was funded at closing in October 2019. The Company expects cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, and access to its debt facility will be sufficient to fund its planned operating and capital expenditures through year-end 2021.

Dated:August 7, 2019 By: /s/ Don Kalkofen Don Kalkofen Chief Financial Officer 3-;-EX-99.1:Exhibit 99.1 Protagonist Therapeutics Reports Second Quarter 2019 Financial Results  Initial Phase 2 results for hepcidin mimetic PTG-300 in beta-thalassemia are expected in the fourth quarter of 2019   Phase 2 study of PTG-300 in polycythemia vera expected to begin in the third quarter of 2019; studies in hereditary hemochromatosis and myelodysplastic syndrome planned for early 2020   Phase 1 studies with oral alpha-4-beta-7 integrin antagonist PN-943 in normal healthy volunteers are complete   Phase 2 U.S. Investigational New Drug (IND) application for Crohns disease filed by partner Janssen Biotech for oral IL-23 receptor antagonist PTG-200  NEWARK, Calif., Aug. 7, 2019  Protagonist Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq:PTGX) today reported financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2019, and provided a corporate update. We continue to make great progress in advancing our three clinical assets in diverse disease areas and are pleased with our cash runway scenario, which we expect will provide operating capital through mid-2021, commented Dinesh V. Patel, Ph.D., Protagonist President and Chief Executive Officer. In addition to the ongoing study of hepcidin mimetic PTG-300 in patients with beta-thalassemia, we expect to initiate a Phase 2 study in the third quarter in patients with polycythemia vera (PV), a rare myeloproliferative disease with limited treatment options. Given the central role of hepcidin in iron homeostasis and erythropoiesis, we view PTG-300 as a one product portfolio with potential applications in multiple blood disorders. We also intend to initiate a Phase 2 study in patients with hereditary hemochromatosis, and we expect that an investigator-sponsored trial in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes will begin in early 2020. These indications rely on different aspects of iron biology that comprise the central mechanism of PTG-300 and offer the advantage of allowing evaluation in small clinical studies with objective endpoints. We are also pleased with the successful completion of the Phase 1 study of our oral alpha-4-beta-7 integrin antagonist PN-943 in normal healthy volunteers, and are advancing PN-943 toward a Phase 2 study in patients with ulcerative colitis. Finally, our oral IL-23 receptor antagonist PTG-200, partnered with Janssen, is moving forward in a Phase 2 study in patients with Crohns disease. Corporate and Product Development Updates: Financing · During the second quarter of 2019, the Company issued 921,684 shares through its at-the-market (ATM) program and raised $10.5 million, at an average of $11.44 per share. · The Company also reported sales of an additional 1.2 million shares through its ATM program during July 2019, raising $15.0 million, or $12.64 per share. · The additional funding is expected to extend the Companys cash runway through mid-2021 as it advances its three clinical programs. · As of July 31, 2019, the Company had $22.1 million remaining available for sale under its ATM financing facility. PTG-300 · Protagonist is conducting the Phase 2 TRANSCEND study, a single-arm, open label, study of PTG-300, an injectable hepcidin mimetic, in the treatment of patients with transfusion-dependent as well as non-transfusion dependent beta-thalassemia. Initial results from this Phase 2 trial are expected in the fourth quarter of 2019, with final topline data expected in the first half of 2020. · Protagonist plans to initiate a Phase 2 study of PTG-300 in patients with polycythemia vera in the third quarter of 2019. · The Company is working toward the initiation of a clinical study in early 2020 of PTG-300 in the treatment of hereditary hemochromatosis, a third indication of development for PTG-300. · An investigator-sponsored study of PTG-300 in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes is also expected to begin in early 2020. PTG-200 · In May 2019, Protagonist expanded its collaboration with Janssen Biotech to include the discovery of second generation oral IL-23 receptor antagonists, with Protagonist receiving a $25 million milestone payment following the signing of the expanded agreement. Protagonist also received research funding supporting full-time equivalent employees. · Protagonist and Janssen are jointly conducting the development of PTG-200 through completion of a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study in Crohns disease. Protagonist and Janssen Biotech completed the filing of a U.S. Investigational New Drug (IND) application to support the global Phase 2 clinical study with initiation expected in the fourth quarter of 2019. PN-943 · In May 2019, Protagonist announced results of the single ascending dose part of the first clinical study of PN-943. The Company also recently announced results from the multiple ascending dose part of the study. Administration of PN-943 was found to be safe and well tolerated, and results of target engagement as measured by blood receptor occupancy were supportive of the higher potency of PN-943 as compared to the first generation antagonist, PTG-100. The PN-943 Phase 1 data has guided the design of a Phase 2 study of PN-943 in patients with ulcerative colitis, with study initiation expected in early 2020. · Preclinical and early clinical research findings from the single ascending dose study describing the properties of PN-943, including high potency relative to PTG-100, were detailed in an oral presentation in May 2019 at the Digestive Diseases Week Conference in San Diego. Financial Results Protagonist reported a net loss of $29.2 million and $43.3 million, respectively, for the second quarter and first six months of 2019, as compared to a net loss of $8.7 million and $16.3 million, respectively, for the same periods of 2018. The increase in net loss for both the second quarter and year-to-date periods was driven primarily by the application of revenue accounting principles following the May 2019 Amendment to the Janssen collaboration agreement. The Company reported an adjustment to revenue of $(8.2) million which decreased the booked license and collaboration revenue in the second quarter. Application of the accounting principles required the Company to re-assess overall timelines as well as re-estimate completed and remaining services following the Collaboration Agreement amendment, leading to the revenue adjustment. The Company also determined that the accounting transaction price had increased to $109.2 million as of June 30, 2019, following the Amendment, from $60.6 million as of March 31, 2019. This has been influenced predominantly by the $25 million milestone payment received from Janssen in the second quarter along with additional research funding and other research and development (R&D) services. The remaining revenue of $64.9 million will be recognized as the Company performs services related to PTG-200 development as well as new services related to the R&D activities for second generation product candidates. The net loss for the second quarter and first six months of 2019 includes non-cash stock-based compensation of $2.0 million and $4.0 million, respectively, as compared to $1.6 million and $2.8 million, respectively, for the same periods of 2018. Amounts reported in the category of license and collaboration revenue were $(8.2) million and $(6.6) million for the second quarter and first six months of 2019, respectively, and contained the cumulative catch-up revenue accounting adjustment following the amendment to the Janssen Collaboration Agreement. This is compared to license and collaboration revenue of $11.7 million and $22.5 million for the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively. R&D expenses for the second quarter and first six months of 2019 were $19.4 million and $31.8 million, respectively, as compared to $17.7 million and $33.1 million, respectively, for the same periods of 2018. The increases in R&D expenses in the second quarter from the same period a year ago are primarily due to increased costs related to preparation for and conduct of clinical trials for our product candidates PTG-300 and PN-943. R&D expenses for the quarter also included an increase in salaries and employee-related expenses. G&A expenses for the second quarter and first six months of 2019 were $3.9 million and $7.6 million, respectively, as compared to $3.2 million and $6.8 million, respectively, for the same periods of 2018. The increases in G&A expenses were primarily due to increases in salaries and employee-related expenses primarily due to an increase in headcount and consulting and professional services expenses to support growth in operations. Protagonist ended the second quarter of 2019 with $126.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. Protagonist forecasts having sufficient financial resources to fund operations through mid-2021. About Protagonist Therapeutics, Inc.

The Company reported an adjustment to revenue of $(8.2) million which decreased the booked license and collaboration revenue in the second quarter. Application of the accounting principles required the Company to re-assess overall timelines as well as re-estimate completed and remaining services following the Collaboration Agreement amendment, leading to the revenue adjustment. The Company also determined that the accounting transaction price had increased to $109.2 million as of June 30, 2019, following the Amendment, from $60.6 million as of March 31, 2019. This has been influenced predominantly by the $25 million milestone payment received from Janssen in the second quarter along with additional research funding and other research and development (R&D) services. The remaining revenue of $64.9 million will be recognized as the Company performs services related to PTG-200 development as well as new services related to the R&D activities for second generation product candidates. The net loss for the second quarter and first six months of 2019 includes non-cash stock-based compensation of $2.0 million and $4.0 million, respectively, as compared to $1.6 million and $2.8 million, respectively, for the same periods of 2018. Amounts reported in the category of license and collaboration revenue were $(8.2) million and $(6.6) million for the second quarter and first six months of 2019, respectively, and contained the cumulative catch-up revenue accounting adjustment following the amendment to the Janssen Collaboration Agreement. This is compared to license and collaboration revenue of $11.7 million and $22.5 million for the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively. R&D expenses for the second quarter and first six months of 2019 were $19.4 million and $31.8 million, respectively, as compared to $17.7 million and $33.1 million, respectively, for the same periods of 2018. The increases in R&D expenses in the second quarter from the same period a year ago are primarily due to increased costs related to preparation for and conduct of clinical trials for our product candidates PTG-300 and PN-943. R&D expenses for the quarter also included an increase in salaries and employee-related expenses. G&A expenses for the second quarter and first six months of 2019 were $3.9 million and $7.6 million, respectively, as compared to $3.2 million and $6.8 million, respectively, for the same periods of 2018. The increases in G&A expenses were primarily due to increases in salaries and employee-related expenses primarily due to an increase in headcount and consulting and professional services expenses to support growth in operations. Protagonist ended the second quarter of 2019 with $126.1 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. Protagonist forecasts having sufficient financial resources to fund operations through mid-2021. About Protagonist Therapeutics, Inc.
