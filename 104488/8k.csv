We remain committed to providing medical care teams with innovative products and services that deliver value and close gaps in access to advanced radiotherapy treatments.” Fiscal First Quarter Results Total net revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was $103.9 million, compared to $96.5 million in the prior fiscal year first quarter.

Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Guidance Accuray’s financial guidance is based on current expectations. The following statements are forward-looking and actual results could differ materially depending on market and economic conditions, supply chain disruption, and the factors set forth under “Safe Harbor Statement” below. The company is reaffirming guidance for fiscal year 2024 as follows: Guidance for non-GAAP financial measures excludes depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, interest expense, provision for income taxes, and ERP and ERP related expenditures. For more information regarding the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this press release, please see ""Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" below. Conference Call Information Accuray will host a conference call beginning at 1:30 p.m. PT/4:30 p.m. ET today to discuss results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 as well as recent corporate developments. Conference call dial-in information is as follows: Individuals interested in listening to the live conference call via the Internet may do so by logging on to the Investor Relations section of Accuray’s website, www.accuray.com.

In addition , a taped replay of the conference call will be available beginning approximately one hour after the call’s conclusion and will be available for seven days. The replay number is (877) 344-7529 (USA), or (412) 317-0088 (International), Conference ID: 7621845. An archived webcast will also be available on Accuray’s website until Accuray announces its results for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Accuray reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) and the rules of the SEC. To supplement its financial statements prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, Accuray uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted EBITDA, and net revenue on a constant currency basis. Accuray has supplemented its GAAP net income (loss) with a non-GAAP measure of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, ERP and ERP related expenditures, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation (“adjusted EBITDA”). The calculation of adjusted EBITDA also excludes certain non-recurring, irregular and one-time items. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding the performance of the company and facilitates a meaningful comparison of results for current periods with previous operating results. A reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) (the most directly comparable GAAP measure) to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA is provided in the schedules below. Accuray has also reported certain operating results on a constant currency basis in order to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of its results without regard to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Management believes disclosure of non-GAAP constant currency results is helpful to investors because it facilitates period-to-period comparisons of the company’s results by increasing the transparency of the underlying performance by excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to net revenue on a constant currency basis is revenue. Accuray calculates the constant currency amounts by translating local currency amounts in the current period using the same foreign translation rate used in the prior period being compared against rather than the actual exchange rate in effect during the current period. There are limitations in using these non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP financial measures. Investors and potential investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures only in conjunction with the company’s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.

ACCURAY INCORPORATED Date: November 7, 2023 By: /s/ Ali Pervaiz Ali Pervaiz Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer 3","EX-99.1:Exhibit 99.1 Accuray Reports Fiscal 2024 First Quarter Financial Results Company Achieves 8% Revenue Growth, Reiterates FY 2024 Guidance MADISON, Wis, November 7, 2023 — Accuray Incorporated (NASDAQ: ARAY) today reported financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 ended September 30, 2023. First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Summary Other Recent Operational Highlights “We delivered another strong quarter of revenue growth and margin expansion with successful execution against our strategic growth agenda,"" said Suzanne Winter, Chief Executive Officer. “I am very pleased with our strong start to the fiscal year, which includes key new product introductions and regulatory milestones that I believe will be the catalysts for increased use and adoption of our technology. We remain committed to providing medical care teams with innovative products and services that deliver value and close gaps in access to advanced radiotherapy treatments.” Fiscal First Quarter Results Total net revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was $103.9 million, compared to $96.5 million in the prior fiscal year first quarter. Product revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was $53.4 million, compared to $44.6 million in the prior fiscal year first quarter. Service revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was $50.5 million, compared to $51.9 million in the prior fiscal year first quarter.

Operating expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 were $37.3 million, compared to $36.8 million in the prior fiscal year first quarter. Net loss in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was $3.0 million, or $0.03 per share, compared to a net loss of $5.4 million, or $0.06 per share, in the prior fiscal year first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was $6.5 million, compared to $1.9 million in the prior fiscal year first quarter. Gross product orders in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 totaled $63.7 million compared to $69.8 million in the prior fiscal year first quarter.

Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Guidance Accuray’s financial guidance is based on current expectations. The following statements are forward-looking and actual results could differ materially depending on market and economic conditions, supply chain disruption, and the factors set forth under “Safe Harbor Statement” below. The company is reaffirming guidance for fiscal year 2024 as follows: Guidance for non-GAAP financial measures excludes depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, interest expense, provision for income taxes, and ERP and ERP related expenditures. For more information regarding the non-GAAP financial measures discussed in this press release, please see ""Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" below. Conference Call Information Accuray will host a conference call beginning at 1:30 p.m. PT/4:30 p.m. ET today to discuss results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 as well as recent corporate developments. Conference call dial-in information is as follows: Individuals interested in listening to the live conference call via the Internet may do so by logging on to the Investor Relations section of Accuray’s website, www.accuray.com. There will be a slide presentation accompanying today’s event which can also be accessed on the company’s Investor Relations page at www.accuray.com. In addition , a taped replay of the conference call will be available beginning approximately one hour after the call’s conclusion and will be available for seven days. The replay number is (877) 344-7529 (USA), or (412) 317-0088 (International), Conference ID: 7621845. An archived webcast will also be available on Accuray’s website until Accuray announces its results for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Accuray reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) and the rules of the SEC. To supplement its financial statements prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, Accuray uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as adjusted EBITDA, and net revenue on a constant currency basis. Accuray has supplemented its GAAP net income (loss) with a non-GAAP measure of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, ERP and ERP related expenditures, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation (“adjusted EBITDA”). The calculation of adjusted EBITDA also excludes certain non-recurring, irregular and one-time items. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding the performance of the company and facilitates a meaningful comparison of results for current periods with previous operating results. A reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) (the most directly comparable GAAP measure) to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA is provided in the schedules below. Accuray has also reported certain operating results on a constant currency basis in order to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of its results without regard to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Management believes disclosure of non-GAAP constant currency results is helpful to investors because it facilitates period-to-period comparisons of the company’s results by increasing the transparency of the underlying performance by excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to net revenue on a constant currency basis is revenue. Accuray calculates the constant currency amounts by translating local currency amounts in the current period using the same foreign translation rate used in the prior period being compared against rather than the actual exchange rate in effect during the current period. There are limitations in using these non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP financial measures. Investors and potential investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures only in conjunction with the company’s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Management believes that non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding the performance of the company and facilitates a more meaningful comparison of results for current periods with previous operating results. Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures assist management in analyzing future trends, making strategic and business decisions, and establishing internal budgets and forecasts. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is provided in the Appendix. Accuray has also reported certain operating results on a constant currency basis in order to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of its results without regard to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Management believes disclosure of non-GAAP constant currency results is helpful to investors because it facilitates period-to-period comparisons of the company's results by increasing the transparency of the underlying performance by excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Accuray calculates the constant currency amounts by translating local currency amounts in the current period using the same foreign translation rate used in the prior period being compared against rather than the actual exchange rate in effect during the current period. There are limitations in using these non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP financial measures.

Forward-looking statements in this presentation relate, but are not limited, to: expectations regarding fiscal 2024 through 2026 financial metrics, including revenue and unit targets, adjusted EBITDA margin goals, targets for inventory turnover, days sales outstanding and cash position; expectations regarding our strategic growth plans, including our goals to create meaningful value and close the gaps in cancer care, regional strategies and priorities, priorities and goals to build durable organic growth; plans and expectations regarding our future technologies and services as well as planned product and service introductions; expectations regarding the size and growth of the radiotherapy market; expectations regarding trends in cancer and radiation therapy and our ability to capitalize on those trends; expectations regarding expanding commercial growth through our partnerships; expectations regarding service as a significant revenue and margin growth opportunity; and expectations regarding margin expansion and adjusted EBITDA margin expansion. Forward-looking statements generally can be identified by words such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “projects,” “may,” “will be,” “will continue,” and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: risks related to the current global economic environment, including in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation or recession on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows; disruptions to our supply chain, including increased logistics costs; our ability to achieve widespread market acceptance of our products, including new product offerings and improvements; our ability to develop new products or enhance existing products to meet customers’ needs and compete favorably in the market; our ability to realize the expected benefits of the joint-venture and other partnerships; risks inherent in international operations; our ability to effectively manage our growth; our ability to maintain or increase our gross margins on product sales and services; delays in regulatory approvals or the development or release of new offerings; our ability to meet the covenants under our credit facilities; our ability to convert backlog to revenue; and other risks identified under the heading “Risk Factors” in our annual report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on September 7, 2023, and as updated periodically with our other filings with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made and are based on information available to Accuray at the time those statements are made and/or management’s good faith belief as of that time with respect to future events. Accuray assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect actual performance or results, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting forward-looking information, except to the extent required by applicable securities laws. Accordingly, investors should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Non-GAAP Financial Measures This presentation also contains non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding the performance of the company and facilitates a more meaningful comparison of results for current periods with previous operating results. Additionally, these non-GAAP financial measures assist management in analyzing future trends, making strategic and business decisions, and establishing internal budgets and forecasts. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is provided in the Appendix. Accuray has also reported certain operating results on a constant currency basis in order to facilitate period-to-period comparisons of its results without regard to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Management believes disclosure of non-GAAP constant currency results is helpful to investors because it facilitates period-to-period comparisons of the company's results by increasing the transparency of the underlying performance by excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Accuray calculates the constant currency amounts by translating local currency amounts in the current period using the same foreign translation rate used in the prior period being compared against rather than the actual exchange rate in effect during the current period. There are limitations in using these non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP financial measures. Investors and potential investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures only in conjunction with the company’s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Philip Morris International: Delivering a Smoke-Free Future Philip Morris International (PMI) is leading a transformation in the tobacco industry to create a smoke-free future and ultimately replace cigarettes with smoke-free products to the benefit of adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, society, the company and its shareholders. PMI is a leading international tobacco company engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes, smoke-free products and associated electronic devices and accessories, and other nicotine-containing products in markets outside the U.S. PMI is building a future on a new category of smoke-free products that, while not risk-free, are a much better choice than continuing to smoke. Through multidisciplinary capabilities in product development, state-of-the-art facilities and scientific substantiation, PMI aims to ensure that its smoke-free products meet adult consumer preferences and rigorous regulatory requirements. PMI’s smoke-free IQOS product portfolio includes heat-not-burn and nicotine-containing vapor products. As of June 30, 2019, PMI estimates that approximately 8.0 million adult smokers around the world have already stopped smoking and switched to PMI’s heat-not-burn product, available for sale in 48 markets in key cities or nationwide under the IQOS brand.

(NYSE: PM) today announced that it is in discussions with Altria Group, Inc. (NYSE: MO) regarding a potential all-stock, merger of equals. There can be no assurance that any agreement or transaction will result from these discussions.

Philip Morris International intends to make no further comment regarding the discussions unless and until it is appropriate to do so. Philip Morris International: Delivering a Smoke-Free Future Philip Morris International (PMI) is leading a transformation in the tobacco industry to create a smoke-free future and ultimately replace cigarettes with smoke-free products to the benefit of adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, society, the company and its shareholders. PMI is a leading international tobacco company engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes, smoke-free products and associated electronic devices and accessories, and other nicotine-containing products in markets outside the U.S. PMI is building a future on a new category of smoke-free products that, while not risk-free, are a much better choice than continuing to smoke. Through multidisciplinary capabilities in product development, state-of-the-art facilities and scientific substantiation, PMI aims to ensure that its smoke-free products meet adult consumer preferences and rigorous regulatory requirements. PMI’s smoke-free IQOS product portfolio includes heat-not-burn and nicotine-containing vapor products. As of June 30, 2019, PMI estimates that approximately 8.0 million adult smokers around the world have already stopped smoking and switched to PMI’s heat-not-burn product, available for sale in 48 markets in key cities or nationwide under the IQOS brand.

(NYSE: PM) today announced its 2019 second-quarter results and increases its 2019 full-year reported diluted earnings per share forecast. Comparisons presented in this press release on a ""like-for-like"" basis reflect pro forma 2018 results, which have been adjusted for the deconsolidation of PMI's Canadian subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson & Hedges, Inc. (RBH), effective March 22, 2019 (the date of deconsolidation). In addition, reflecting the deconsolidation, PMI's total market share has been restated for previous periods. 2019 SECOND-QUARTER & YEAR-TO-DATE HIGHLIGHTS 2019 Second-Quarter • Reported diluted EPS of $1.49 , up by 5.7% ; up by 10.6% , excluding currency • Adjusted diluted EPS of $1.46 , up by 3.5% ; up by 15.0% on a like-for-like basis, excluding currency • Cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume down by 1.4% (down by 0.7% on a like-for-like basis), reflecting cigarette shipment volume down by 3.6% and heated tobacco unit shipment volume up by 37.0% • Net revenues down by 0.3% ; up by 9.0% on a like-for-like basis, excluding currency • Operating income up by 3.0% ; up by 8.4% , excluding currency • Adjusted operating income up by 15.7% on a like-for-like basis, excluding currency • Adjusted operating income margin, excluding currency, increased by 2.4 points to 41.4% on a like-for-like basis • PMI declared a regular quarterly dividend of $1.14 , representing an annualized rate of $4.56 per common share • The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced that the marketing of IQOS , PMI's electrically heated tobacco system, is appropriate for the protection of public health and authorized it for sale in the United States 2019 Six Months Year-to-Date • Reported diluted EPS of $2.36 , down by 2.1% ; up by 3.3% , excluding currency • Adjusted diluted EPS of $2.55 , up by 5.8% ; up by 15.0% on a like-for-like basis, excluding currency • Cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume down by 0.2% ( up by 0.1% on a like-for-like basis), reflecting cigarette shipment volume down by 1.9% and heated tobacco unit shipment volume up by 29.2% • Net revenues down by 1.2% ; up by 6.2% on a like-for-like basis, excluding currency • Operating income down by 5.1% ; up by 0.5% , excluding currency • Adjusted operating income up by 12.7% on a like-for-like basis, excluding currency • Adjusted operating income margin, excluding currency, increased by 2.2 points to 39.4% on a like-for-like basis ""Building on our encouraging start to the year, we delivered another strong quarter that continues to demonstrate the soundness of our strategies and the quality of our execution, "" said André Calantzopoulos, Chief Executive Officer . ""Of particular note is our combined cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume, which -- for the first six months of the year -- was up by 0.1% on a like-for-like basis. This positive performance was led by robust in-market heated tobacco unit year-to-date sales growth of 34.0% , making HEETS/HeatSticks, combined, a top-ten international tobacco brand, despite only being present in approximately one quarter of our markets. In the markets where they are sold, our heated tobacco brands held a sizable combined share of 5.0% year-to-date, driving a total international share of 2.1% , up by 0.6 points."" ""Our strong year-to-date results are the reason behind today's announcement to increase our full-year guidance and raise our currency-neutral, like-for-like 2019 full-year adjusted diluted EPS growth rate by one percentage point to at least 9% in a further demonstration of our overall confidence in PMI's short and long-term growth prospects. This projection includes additional investment behind our RRP portfolio to support geographic expansion and portfolio development that should help us enter 2020 in an even stronger position."" 2019 FULL-YEAR FORECAST Full-Year 2019 EPS Forecast 2019 Forecast 2018 Adjusted Growth Reported Diluted EPS ≥ $4.94 (a) $5.08 2018 Tax items — 0.02 2019 Tax items (0.04 ) — 2019 Asset impairment and exit costs 0.03 — 2019 Canadian tobacco litigation-related expense 0.09 — 2019 Loss on deconsolidation of RBH 0.12 — Adjusted Diluted EPS $5.14 $5.10 Net earnings attributable to RBH (0.26 ) (b) Adjusted Diluted EPS $5.14 $4.84 (c) Currency (0.14 ) Adjusted Diluted EPS, excl. currency $5.28 $4.84 (c) ≥ 9 % (a) Reflects the exclusion of previously anticipated net EPS of approximately $0.28 attributable to RBH from March 22, 2019 through December 31, 2019. The impact relating to the eight-day stub period was not material. (b) Net reported diluted EPS attributable to RBH from March 22, 2018 through December 31, 2018. (c) Pro forma. PMI revises its full-year 2019 reported diluted EPS forecast to be at least $4.94 at prevailing exchange rates, compared to the previously communicated forecast of at least $4.87, versus $5.08 in 2018. This revised full-year guidance reflects: • The net impact of the loss on deconsolidation of PMI's Canadian subsidiary Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. (RBH) under U.S. GAAP of approximately $ 0.12 per share, recorded in the first quarter of 2019, which is a non-cash item, as well as the Canadian tobacco litigation-related expense of approximately $ 0.09 per share; - -2 - • The exclusion, announced on March 22, 2019, of RBH’s previously anticipated net earnings from PMI’s consolidated financial statements, from March 22, 2019 (the date of deconsolidation) to December 31, 2019, of approximately $0.28 per share; • Asset impairment and exit costs of approximately $ 0.03 per share resulting from plant closures as part of global manufacturing infrastructure optimization, reflecting: $0.01 per share related to Pakistan recorded in the first quarter of 2019; and $0.02 per share related to Colombia ($0.01 per share recorded in the second quarter of 2019 and $0.01 per share anticipated in the third quarter of 2019); • A favorable tax item of $0.04 per share related to a reduction in estimated U.S. federal income tax on dividend repatriation for the years 2015-2018; • An unfavorable currency impact, at prevailing exchange rates, of approximately $0.14 ; • A full-year effective tax rate of approximately 23%, excluding discrete tax items and Loss on Deconsolidation of RBH; and • A projected increase of at least 9%, excluding currency, versus pro forma adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.84 in 2018, as detailed in the attached Schedule 3 and as shown in the 2019 EPS Forecast table above. 2019 Full-Year Forecast Overview & Assumptions This forecast assumes: • A total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume decline for PMI of approximately 1.0%, on a like-for-like basis, compared to the previously disclosed range of approximately 1.5% to 2.0%; • An estimated total international industry volume decline, excluding China and the U.S., at the lower end of the previously disclosed range of approximately 2.5% to 3.0%; and • Currency-neutral net revenue growth of at least 6% on a like-for-like basis, compared to the previously disclosed assumption of at least 5%, which includes an adverse impact of approximately 0.7 points related to the move to highly inflationary accounting in Argentina resulting in the treatment of the U.S. dollar as the functional currency of the company’s Argentinian affiliates. This forecast further assumes: • Net incremental investment behind RRPs of approximately $400 million for the full year 2019, compared to the previously disclosed estimate of approximately $300 million. Approximately half of the total net incremental investment of $400 million is expected in the third quarter; • An increase in full-year currency-neutral, like-for-like adjusted operating income margin of at least 100 basis points compared to 2018; • Operating cash flow of approximately $9.5 billion, subject to year-end working capital requirements; • Capital expenditures of approximately $1.1 billion; and • No share repurchases. This forecast excludes the impact of any future acquisitions, unanticipated asset impairment and exit cost charges, future changes in currency exchange rates, further developments related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, further developments pertaining to the judgment in the two Québec Class Action lawsuits and the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA) protection granted to RBH and any unusual events. This forecast also excludes the contemplated proposal, previously communicated by PMI's local affiliate, to end cigarette production in Berlin, - -3 - Germany, by January 2020. Factors described in the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements section of this release represent continuing risks to these projections. FDA Authorization for Sale of IQOS in the United States On April 30, 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that the marketing of IQOS , PMI's electrically heated tobacco system, is appropriate for the protection of public health and authorized it for sale in the United States. The FDA’s decision follows its comprehensive assessment of PMI’s premarket tobacco product applications (PMTAs) submitted to the Agency in 2017. PMI will bring IQOS to the U.S. through an exclusive license with Altria Group, Inc., whose subsidiary, Philip Morris USA, will market the product and comply with the provisions set forth in the FDA's marketing order, and has the expertise and infrastructure to ensure a successful launch, beginning with the initial lead market of Atlanta, Georgia.

Excluding estimated net trade inventory movements, the total market decreased by 7.4% ; • Canada, down by 9.5% , reflecting the same factor as in the quarter; and • Venezuela, down by 58.5%, reflecting the same factors as in the quarter; partly offset by: • Mexico, up by 3.3% , or down by 0.4% excluding estimated net trade inventory movements related to the timing of price increases. - -25 - PMI's total shipment volume decreased by 7.9% to 36.2 billion units, or by 4.4% on a like-for-like basis mainly due to: • Argentina, down by 10.5% , primarily reflecting the lower total market, as well as lower market share; and • Venezuela, down by 80.9%, primarily reflecting the lower total market, as well as lower market share; partly offset by • Mexico, up by 6.3% , reflecting the same factors as in the quarter. - -26 - FDA NEWS RELEASE (APRIL 30, 2019) (https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-permits-sale-iqos-tobacco-heating-system-through-premarket-tobacco-product-application-pathway) FDA permits sale of IQOS Tobacco Heating System through premarket tobacco product application pathway Agency places stringent marketing restrictions on heated tobacco products aimed at preventing youth access and exposure to the new products For Immediate Release: April 30, 2019 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today announced it has authorized the marketing of new tobacco products manufactured by Philip Morris Products S.A. for the IQOS “Tobacco Heating System” – an electronic device that heats tobacco-filled sticks wrapped in paper to generate a nicotine-containing aerosol. The FDA has placed stringent marketing restrictions on the products in an effort to prevent youth access and exposure. Following a rigorous science-based review through the premarket tobacco product application (PMTA) pathway, the agency determined that authorizing these products for the U.S. market is appropriate for the protection of the public health because, among several key considerations, the products produce fewer or lower levels of some toxins than combustible cigarettes. The products authorized for sale include the IQOS device, Marlboro Heatsticks, Marlboro Smooth Menthol Heatsticks and Marlboro Fresh Menthol Heatsticks. While today’s action permits the tobacco products to be sold in the U.S., it does not mean these products are safe or “FDA approved.” All tobacco products are potentially harmful and addictive and those who do not use tobacco products should continue not to. Additionally, today’s action is not a decision on the separate modified risk tobacco product (MRTP) applications that the company also submitted for these products to market them with claims of reduced exposure or reduced risk. “Ensuring new tobacco products undergo a robust premarket evaluation by the FDA is a critical part of our mission to protect the public, particularly youth, and to reduce tobacco-related disease and death. While the authorization of new tobacco products doesn’t mean they are safe, the review process makes certain that the marketing of the products is appropriate for the protection of the public health, taking into account the risks and benefits to the population as a whole. This includes how the products may impact youth use of nicotine and tobacco, and the potential for the products to completely move adult smokers away from use of combustible cigarettes,” said Mitch Zeller, J.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products. “Importantly, the FDA is putting in place postmarket requirements aimed at, among other things, monitoring market dynamics such as potential youth uptake. We’ll be keeping a close watch on the marketplace, including how the company is marketing these products, and will take action as necessary to ensure the continued sale of these products in the U.S. remains appropriate and make certain that the company complies with the agency’s marketing restrictions to prevent youth access and exposure. As other manufacturers seek to market new tobacco products, the FDA remains committed to upholding the vital public health standards under the law and using all the tools at our disposal to ensure the efficient and appropriate oversight of tobacco products.” Under the PMTA pathway, manufacturers must demonstrate to the agency, among other things, that marketing of the new tobacco product would be appropriate for the protection of the public health. That standard requires the FDA to consider the risks and benefits to the population as a whole, including users and non-users of tobacco products. Importantly this includes youth. The agency’s evaluation includes reviewing a tobacco product’s components, ingredients, additives and health risks, as well as how the product is manufactured, packaged and - -27 - labeled. The review for the IQOS products took into account the increased or decreased likelihood that existing tobacco product users will stop using tobacco products, and the increased or decreased likelihood that those who do not use tobacco products will start using them. In particular, through the FDA’s scientific evaluation of the company’s applications, peer-reviewed published literature and other sources, the agency found that the aerosol produced by the IQOS Tobacco Heating System contains fewer toxic chemicals than cigarette smoke, and many of the toxins identified are present at lower levels than in cigarette smoke. For example, the carbon monoxide exposure from IQOS aerosol is comparable to environmental exposure, and levels of acrolein and formaldehyde are 89% to 95% and 66% to 91% lower than from combustible cigarettes, respectively. Additionally, IQOS delivers nicotine in levels close to combustible cigarettes suggesting a likelihood that IQOS users may be able to completely transition away from combustible cigarettes and use IQOS exclusively. Available data, while limited, also indicate that few non-tobacco users would be likely to choose to start using IQOS, including youth. While these non-combusted cigarettes may be referred to as “heat-not-burn” or “heated” tobacco products, they meet the definition of a cigarette in the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Therefore, these products must adhere to existing restrictions for cigarettes under FDA regulations, as well as other federal laws that, among other things, prohibit television and radio advertising. In addition, to further limit youth access to the products and exposure to their advertising and promotion, the FDA is placing stringent restrictions on how the products are marketed – particularly via websites and through social media platforms – by including requirements that advertising be targeted to adults. The company must also give notification to the FDA of, among other things, its labeling, advertising, marketing plans, including information about specific adult target audiences, and how it plans to restrict youth access and limit youth exposure to the products’ labeling, advertising, marketing and promotion. The agency has issued a document providing its rationale for these postmarket requirements, which highlight important considerations for reviewing the company’s applications as well any potential future PMTAs for other products. The FDA also is requiring all package labels and advertisements for these products to include a warning about the addictiveness of nicotine, in addition to other warnings required for cigarettes, to prevent consumer misperceptions about the relative addiction risk of using IQOS compared to combusted cigarettes. With the authorization of these products, the FDA will evaluate new available data regarding the products through postmarketing records and reports required in the marketing order. The company is required to report regularly to the FDA with information regarding the products on the market, including, but not limited to, ongoing and completed consumer research studies, advertising, marketing plans, sales data, information on current and new users, manufacturing changes and adverse experiences. The FDA may withdraw a marketing order if it, among other reasons, determines that the continued marketing of a product is no longer appropriate for the protection of the public health, such as if there is an uptake of the product by youth. The FDA is continuing its substantive scientific review of the company’s MRTP applications. The company would need to receive an MRTP order from the FDA before they could market a tobacco product with any implicit or explicit claims that, among other things, a product reduces exposure to certain chemicals or that use of the product is less harmful than another tobacco product or would reduce the risk of disease. If a company markets a tobacco product as an MRTP without authorization, the company would be in violation of the law and may face FDA advisory or enforcement actions. #### - -28 - Philip Morris International: Delivering a Smoke-Free Future Philip Morris International (PMI) is leading a transformation in the tobacco industry to create a smoke-free future and ultimately replace cigarettes with smoke-free products to the benefit of adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, society, the company and its shareholders. PMI is a leading international tobacco company engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes, smoke-free products and associated electronic devices and accessories, and other nicotine-containing products in markets outside the U.S. PMI is building a future on a new category of smoke-free products that, while not risk-free, are a much better choice than continuing to smoke. Through multidisciplinary capabilities in product development, state-of-the-art facilities and scientific substantiation, PMI aims to ensure that its smoke-free products meet adult consumer preferences and rigorous regulatory requirements. PMI's smoke-free IQOS product portfolio includes heat-not-burn and nicotine-containing vapor products. As of June 30, 2019 , PMI estimates that approximately 8.0 million adult smokers around the world have already stopped smoking and switched to PMI’s heat-not-burn product, available for sale in 48 markets in key cities or nationwide under the IQOS brand.

Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements This press release contains projections of future results and other forward-looking statements. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. In the event that risks or uncertainties materialize, or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those contained in such forward-looking statements. Pursuant to the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, PMI is identifying important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by PMI. PMI's business risks include: excise tax increases and discriminatory tax structures; increasing marketing and regulatory restrictions that could reduce our competitiveness, eliminate our ability to communicate with adult consumers, or ban certain of our products; health concerns relating to the use of tobacco products and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke; litigation related to tobacco use; intense competition; the effects of global and individual country economic, regulatory and political developments, natural disasters and conflicts; changes in adult smoker behavior; lost revenues as a result of counterfeiting, contraband and cross-border purchases; governmental investigations; unfavorable currency exchange rates and currency devaluations, and limitations on the ability to repatriate funds; adverse changes in applicable corporate tax laws; adverse changes in the cost and quality of tobacco and other agricultural products and raw materials; and the integrity of its information systems and effectiveness of its data privacy policies. PMI's future profitability may also be adversely affected should it be unsuccessful in its attempts to produce and commercialize reduced-risk products or if regulation or taxation do not differentiate between such products and cigarettes; if it is unable to successfully introduce new products, promote brand equity, enter new markets or improve its margins through increased prices and productivity gains; if it is unable to expand its brand portfolio internally or through acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships; or if it is unable to attract and retain the best global talent. Future results are also subject to the lower predictability of our reduced-risk product category's performance. PMI is further subject to other risks detailed from time to time in its publicly filed documents, including the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2019. PMI cautions that the foregoing list of important factors is not a complete discussion of all potential risks and uncertainties. PMI does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that it may make from time to time, except in the normal course of its public disclosure obligations. - -29 - Key Terms, Definitions and Explanatory Notes General • ""PMI"" refers to Philip Morris International Inc. and its subsidiaries. Trademarks and service marks that are the registered property of, or licensed by, the subsidiaries of PMI, are italicized. • Comparisons are made to the same prior-year period unless otherwise stated. • Unless otherwise stated, references to total industry, total market, PMI shipment volume and PMI market share performance reflect cigarettes and heated tobacco units. • [REVISED] References to total international market, defined as worldwide cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume excluding the United States, total industry, total market and market shares are PMI estimates for tax-paid products based on the latest available data from a number of internal and external sources and may, in defined instances, exclude the People's Republic of China and/or PMI's duty free business. In addition, to reflect the deconsolidation of PMI's Canadian subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson & Hedges, Inc. (RBH), effective March 22, 2019, PMI's total market share has been restated for previous periods. • ""OTP"" is defined as ""other tobacco products,"" primarily roll-your-own and make-your-own cigarettes, pipe tobacco, cigars and cigarillos, and does not include reduced-risk products. • ""Combustible products"" is the term PMI uses to refer to cigarettes and OTP, combined. • In-market sales, or ""IMS,"" is defined as sales to the retail channel, depending on the market and distribution model. • ""Total shipment volume"" is defined as the combined total of cigarette shipment volume and heated tobacco unit shipment volume. • ""North Africa"" is defined as Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia. • ""The GCC"" (Gulf Cooperation Council) is defined as Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). • Following the deconsolidation of PMI's Canadian subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson & Hedges, Inc. (RBH), PMI will continue to report the volume of brands sold by RBH for which other PMI subsidiaries are the trademark owner. These include HEETS , Next , Philip Morris and Rooftop , which accounted for approximately 40% of RBH's total shipment volume in 2018. • [REVISED] From time to time, PMI’s shipment volumes are subject to the impact of distributor inventory movements, and estimated total industry/market volumes are subject to the impact of inventory movements in various trade channels that include estimated trade inventory movements of PMI’s competitors arising from market-specific factors that significantly distort reported volume disclosures. Such factors may include changes to the manufacturing supply chain, shipment methods, consumer demand, timing of excise tax increases or other influences that may affect the timing of sales to customers. In such instances, in addition to reviewing PMI shipment volumes and certain estimated total industry/market volumes on a reported basis, management reviews these measures on an adjusted basis that excludes the impact of distributor and/or estimated trade inventory movements. Management also believes that disclosing PMI shipment volumes and estimated total industry/market volumes in such circumstances on a basis that excludes the impact of distributor and/or estimated trade inventory movements, such as on an IMS basis, improves the comparability of performance and trends for these measures over different reporting periods. Financial • Net revenues related to combustible products refer to the operating revenues generated from the sale of these products, including shipping and handling charges billed to customers, net of sales and promotion incentives, and excise taxes. PMI recognizes revenue when control is transferred to the customer, typically either upon shipment or delivery of goods. • Net revenues related to RRPs represent the sale of heated tobacco units, IQOS devices and related accessories, and other nicotine-containing products, primarily e-vapor products, including shipping and handling charges billed to customers, net of sales and promotion incentives, and excise taxes. PMI recognizes revenue when control is transferred to the customer, typically either upon shipment or delivery of goods. • ""Cost of sales"" consists principally of: tobacco leaf, non-tobacco raw materials, labor and manufacturing costs; shipping and handling costs; and the cost of IQOS devices produced by third-party electronics manufacturing service providers. Estimated costs associated with IQOS warranty programs are generally provided for in cost of sales in the period the related revenues are recognized. - -30 - • ""Marketing, administration and research costs"" include the costs of marketing and selling our products, other costs generally not related to the manufacture of our products (including general corporate expenses), and costs incurred to develop new products. The most significant components of our marketing, administration and research costs are marketing and sales expenses and general and administrative expenses. • [REVISED] ""Cost/Other"" in the Consolidated Financial Summary table of total PMI and the six reporting segments of this release reflects the currency-neutral variances of: cost of sales (excluding the volume/mix cost component); marketing, administration and research costs (including asset impairment and exit costs, the Canadian tobacco litigation-related expense and the charge related to the deconsolidation of RBH in Canada); and amortization of intangibles. “Cost/Other” also includes the currency-neutral net revenue variance, unrelated to volume/mix and price components, attributable to fees for certain distribution rights billed to customers in certain markets in the ME&A Region, as well as the impact of the deconsolidation in RBH. • ""Adjusted Operating Income Margin"" is calculated as adjusted operating income, divided by net revenues. • ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and equity (income)/loss in unconsolidated subsidiaries, excluding asset impairment and exit costs, and unusual items. • ""Net debt"" is defined as total debt, less cash and cash equivalents. • Management reviews net revenues, OI, OI margins, operating cash flow and earnings per share, or ""EPS,"" on an adjusted basis, which may exclude the impact of currency and other items such as acquisitions, asset impairment and exit costs, tax items and other special items. For example, PMI’s adjusted diluted EPS and other impacted results reflect the loss on deconsolidation of RBH and the Canadian tobacco litigation-related expense, recorded in the first quarter of 2019. PMI believes that the adjusted measures, including pro forma measures, will provide useful insight into underlying business trends and results, and will provide a more meaningful performance comparison for the period during which RBH remains under CCAA protection. For PMI's 2018 pro forma adjusted diluted EPS by quarter and year-to-date, see Schedule 3 in PMI's second-quarter 2019 earnings release. • Management reviews these measures because they exclude changes in currency exchange rates and other factors that may distort underlying business trends, thereby improving the comparability of PMI’s business performance between reporting periods. Furthermore, PMI uses several of these measures in its management compensation program to promote internal fairness and a disciplined assessment of performance against company targets. PMI discloses these measures to enable investors to view the business through the eyes of management. • Non-GAAP measures used in this release should neither be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for the financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures, see the relevant schedules provided with this press release. • U.S. GAAP Treatment of Argentina as a Highly Inflationary Economy. Following the categorization of Argentina by the International Practices Task Force of the Center for Audit Quality as a country with a three-year cumulative inflation rate greater than 100%, the country is considered highly inflationary in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Consequently, PMI began to account for the operations of its Argentinian affiliates as highly inflationary, and to treat the U.S. dollar as the functional currency of the affiliates, effective July 1, 2018. The move to highly inflationary accounting in Argentina reduced PMI's currency-neutral net revenue growth by approximately 0.6 points in 2018. Reduced-Risk Products • ""Reduced-risk products,"" or ""RRPs,"" is the term PMI uses to refer to products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to smokers who switch to these products versus continued smoking. PMI has a range of RRPs in various stages of development, scientific assessment and commercialization. Because PMI's RRPs do not burn tobacco, they produce an aerosol that contains far lower quantities of harmful and potentially harmful constituents than found in cigarette smoke. • ""Heated tobacco units,"" or ""HTUs,"" is the term PMI uses to refer to heated tobacco consumables, which include the company's HEETS , HEETS Marlboro and HEETS FROM MARLBORO , defined collectively as HEETS , as well as Marlboro HeatSticks and Parliament HeatSticks . • Unless otherwise stated, all references to IQOS are to PMI's heat-not-burn products. • The IQOS heat-not-burn device is a precisely controlled heating device into which a specially designed and proprietary tobacco unit is inserted and heated to generate an aerosol. - -31 - Appendix 1 PHILIP MORRIS INTERNATIONAL INC. and Subsidiaries Key Market Data Quarters Ended June 30, Market Total Market, bio units PMI Shipments, bio units PMI Market Share, % (1) Total Cigarette HTU Total HTU 2019 2018 % Change 2019 2018 % Change 2019 2018 % Change 2019 2018 % Change 2019 2018 pp Change 2019 2018 pp Change Total PMI 696.0 702.5 (0.9 ) 198.9 201.7 (1.4 ) 183.8 190.7 (3.6 ) 15.1 11.0 37.0 28.3 28.2 0.1 2.1 1.6 0.5 European Union France 9.8 10.5 (6.6 ) 4.5 5.0 (10.6 ) 4.5 5.0 (10.8 ) — — — 44.7 45.2 (0.5 ) 0.2 0.1 0.1 Germany 18.9 19.6 (3.4 ) 7.3 7.4 (2.0 ) 7.1 7.3 (3.8 ) 0.2 0.1 +100 38.5 38.0 0.5 1.1 0.4 0.7 Italy 17.1 17.7 (3.1 ) 9.3 9.3 0.1 8.5 9.0 (5.5 ) 0.8 0.3 +100 51.8 51.3 0.5 4.6 1.9 2.7 Poland 12.3 11.4 8.0 5.0 4.7 6.7 4.8 4.6 2.9 0.3 0.1 +100 40.8 41.3 (0.5 ) 2.0 0.6 1.4 Spain 11.6 11.6 (0.6 ) 3.9 3.9 (0.9 ) 3.8 3.8 (1.7 ) 0.1 0.1 60.8 31.2 31.8 (0.6 ) 0.7 0.4 0.3 Eastern Europe Russia 59.8 62.1 (3.8 ) 17.7 17.5 1.1 15.9 16.9 (6.1 ) 1.8 0.6 +100 29.6 28.1 1.5 2.9 0.8 2.1 Middle East & Africa Saudi Arabia 5.4 5.0 6.7 0.8 1.7 (50.2 ) 0.8 1.7 (50.2 ) — — — 38.9 40.1 (1.2 ) — — — Turkey 31.3 28.6 9.2 12.5 13.5 (7.6 ) 12.5 13.5 (7.6 ) — — — 39.9 47.2 (7.3 ) — — — South & Southeast Asia Indonesia 78.8 75.2 4.8 24.9 25.0 (0.1 ) 24.9 25.0 (0.1 ) — — — 31.7 33.2 (1.5 ) — — — Philippines 18.6 18.9 (1.5 ) 13.1 13.2 (0.4 ) 13.1 13.2 (0.4 ) — — — 70.4 69.6 0.8 — — — East Asia & Australia Australia 2.9 3.3 (10.8 ) 0.9 1.0 (7.6 ) 0.9 1.0 (7.6 ) — — — 31.0 29.9 1.1 — — — Japan 40.6 42.4 (4.3 ) 15.1 15.1 (0.4 ) 8.0 8.7 (8.5 ) 7.1 6.4 10.6 33.9 34.4 (0.5 ) 16.6 15.5 1.1 Korea 17.7 17.9 (1.2 ) 4.1 4.5 (9.8 ) 2.8 3.1 (9.9 ) 1.3 1.4 (9.5 ) 23.1 25.3 (2.2 ) 7.3 8.0 (0.7 ) Latin America & Canada Argentina 7.8 8.6 (9.9 ) 5.6 6.2 (10.0 ) 5.6 6.2 (10.0 ) — — — 72.1 72.2 (0.1 ) — — — Mexico 10.0 9.2 8.3 7.0 6.1 13.4 7.0 6.1 13.4 — — — 69.5 66.4 3.1 — — — (1) Market share estimates are calculated using IMS data Note: % change for Total Market and PMI shipments is computed based on millions of units; PMI Market Share estimates for previous periods are restated to reflect RBH deconsolidation and exclude RBH-owned brands.

Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2019 second-quarter results. You may access the release on www.pmi.com or the PMI Investor Relations App. (SLIDE 2.) A glossary of terms, including the definition for reduced-risk products, or ""RRPs,"" as well as adjustments, other calculations and reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures, are at the end of today’s webcast slides, which are posted on our website. Unless otherwise stated, all references to IQOS are to our IQOS heat-not-burn products. Comparisons presented on a ""like-for-like"" basis reflect pro forma 2018 results, which have been adjusted for the deconsolidation of our Canadian subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson & Hedges, Inc. (RBH), effective March 22, 2019. (SLIDE 3.) Today’s remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements disclosure in today’s presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. It’s now my pleasure to introduce Martin King, our Chief Financial Officer. Martin. 1 MARTIN KING (SLIDE 4.) Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. Building on our encouraging start to the year, we delivered very solid performance in the second quarter, notably reflecting: • Positive momentum for both our combustible tobacco and smoke-free product portfolios; and • Strong currency-neutral adjusted financial results. (SLIDE 5.) Key among our strengths in the second quarter was our volume performance. On a like-for-like basis, total shipment volume declined by 0.7% in the quarter, and increased by 0.1% June year-to-date. This performance was better than we had anticipated, notably driven by the EU Region. Heated tobacco unit shipment volume increased by 37.0% to 15.1 billion units in the quarter, driven by the EU Region, the Eastern Europe Region and Japan. (SLIDE 6.) Second-quarter net revenues increased by 9.0% , excluding currency, on a like-for-like basis, driven by higher HTU shipment volume and favorable pricing for our combustible tobacco portfolio. Our performance was flattered by the timing of pricing in certain markets compared to the prior year, which contributed an estimated two percentage points to net revenue growth. RRP net revenues reached nearly $1.5 billion in the quarter, or nearly 20% of PMI's total net revenues. IQOS devices accounted for approximately 14% of RRP net revenues, compared to approximately 19% in the second quarter of 2018. (SLIDE 7.) We recorded a strong like-for-like combustible pricing variance of over 6% in the quarter, driven notably by Germany, Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines, Russia and Turkey. We have recently increased our cigarette prices in markets such as Mexico and Ukraine, which should further contribute to a positive pricing variance over the balance of 2019. (SLIDE 8.) On a currency-neutral, like-for-like basis, adjusted operating income increased by 15.7% in the second quarter, while adjusted operating income margin increased by 240 basis points. 2 The strong margin expansion was driven primarily by favorable geographic mix related to HTUs, reflecting the increased contribution of volume from IQOS geographies with relatively high unit margins, notably markets in the EU Region. (SLIDE 9.) Like-for-like adjusted diluted EPS increased by 15.0% , excluding currency, driven by our strong business performance. (SLIDE 10.) Our total international market share, excluding China and the U.S., increased by 0.1 percentage point to reach 28.3% in the second quarter. This growth was driven by heated tobacco units, which increased by 0.5 points to reach 2.1% , reflecting broad-based share gains across the EU Region and in Japan and Russia. In the markets where IQOS has been commercialized, our HTU brands recorded a total combined share of nearly 5% in the quarter, despite not yet being fully distributed in many of them. Our share performance for cigarettes in the quarter reflected continued adult smoker out-switching to IQOS , as well as an estimated adverse impact of approximately 0.2 points related to Turkey, due to the timing of price increases vis-a-vis the competition. We expect our share performance in Turkey to improve over the balance of the year. (SLIDE 11.) Turning now to RRPs, we surpassed 11 million IQOS users as of quarter-end. Approximately 70% of the total -- or some eight million IQOS users -- have stopped smoking and switched to IQOS , with the balance in various stages of conversion. (SLIDE 12.) In the EU Region, HEETS continued its sequential quarterly share growth, increasing by 0.3 percentage points to reach 2.4% . This growth reflects success across a broad range of markets with varying regulatory frameworks and adult smoker preferences. (SLIDE 13.) We have achieved significant progress with IQOS across the Region over the past year, as evidenced by the HEETS market shares shown on this slide. This includes strong growth in some of our larger markets, such as Italy, Poland and Germany, as well as even faster growth in other markets, such as the Czech Republic, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania and the Slovak Republic. 3 (SLIDE 14.) HEETS continued its strong performance in Russia in the quarter, with sequential in-market sales growth of over 23% and national share of 2.9% . As a reminder, our first-quarter HEETS share was flattered by the impact on the total market of seasonally lower cigarette industry volume. The in-market sales volume progression therefore remains a more realistic indicator of the brand's trajectory. For reference, we estimate a first-quarter adjusted share of 2.3%, implying sequential share growth of 0.6 points in the second quarter. We continued our geographic expansion during the quarter and are now commercializing IQOS in cities representing an estimated 40% of the market by total industry volume, compared to approximately 32% at the end of the first quarter. (SLIDE 15.) In Japan, our total share for HeatSticks and HEETS increased by 1.1 points versus the second quarter of 2018 to reach 16.6% , further demonstrating that the initiatives we introduced during the second half of last year are paying off and driving a step-up in our share performance. After adjusting for the impact of estimated trade inventory movements -- which benefited our first-quarter share this year -- our share was stable on a sequential basis. We continue to anticipate greater competitive activity in the category as the year progresses. While this may increase competitive churn among adult consumers over the short term as they try new products, we ultimately view this as a positive development for the category overall and for IQOS in particular. As I will cover later in my remarks, we are investing behind further enhancements to the IQOS 3 device in 2019 to reinforce the brand's leadership position. (SLIDE 16.) Importantly, share for both the heated tobacco category and our heated tobacco brands continued to grow sequentially in the quarter, based on the latest consumer offtake share data. (SLIDE 17.) In Korea, the heated tobacco category continues to be highly competitive, particularly in the area of non-menthol flavors and related new taste dimensions. Share for HEETS declined by 0.7 points and was stable on a sequential basis at 7.3% . This performance was flattered by the impact of inventory movements, as seen from the adjusted market share progression. We attribute the current share dynamics mainly to competitive churn, as new devices and consumables from the competition have entered the market and experienced initial trial. 4 We plan to broaden our portfolio of HEETS to better address the unique taste preferences of adult tobacco consumers in Korea, and have related launches scheduled for the second half of 2019. In addition, like Japan, Korea will be an initial focus geography for the upgraded IQOS 3 device. (SLIDE 18.) It is important to remember that, aside from Japan and Korea, our focus for IQOS across most launch markets remains targeted to key cities. These city-level shares compare very favorably to the corresponding national shares and provide an encouraging indicator of the greater opportunity that can come with broader focus and support in IQOS markets. (SLIDE 19.) Before closing on IQOS , I would also like to reiterate our excitement over the prospects for IQOS in the U.S. As a reminder, on April 30th, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration confirmed that the marketing of IQOS is appropriate for the protection of public health and authorized it for sale in the U.S. We are excited to bring IQOS to the U.S. market through an exclusive license with Altria Group, Inc., whose subsidiary Philip Morris USA has the market expertise and infrastructure to ensure a successful launch, beginning with the initial lead market of Atlanta, Georgia. (SLIDE 20.) Turning to our full-year outlook, we are raising our 2019 reported diluted EPS guidance, at prevailing exchange rates, to be at least $4.94. The seven cent increase, compared to our prior guidance on May 1st of at least $4.87, was driven by: • Stronger business performance, primarily reflecting better shipment volume; and • A tax benefit of four cents related to a reduction in estimated U.S. federal income tax on dividend repatriation for the years 2015 to 2018; partly offset by • Asset impairment and exit costs of approximately two cents per share related to a plant closure in Colombia, as part of our global manufacturing infrastructure optimization. Our guidance continues to include an unfavorable currency impact, at prevailing exchange rates, of approximately $0.14 per share, with just one cent in the second half of the year. 5 (SLIDE 21.) After excluding the $0.20 per share of reporting adjustments and tax items outlined on this slide, our forecast represents a projected currency-neutral like-for-like increase of at least 9% versus our pro forma adjusted diluted EPS of $4.84 in 2018. (SLIDE 22.) Our increased guidance now assumes a total shipment volume decline of approximately 1% on a like-for-like basis, versus a decline of 1.5% to 2% assumed previously. We continue to anticipate full-year HTU shipment volume broadly in line with our in-market sales volume, with any net inventory movements in individual markets essentially offsetting on an aggregate basis. For the industry, we now estimate a total volume decline in 2019 of approximately 2.5%, excluding China and the U.S., which is at the low end of the previously communicated decline range of 2.5% to 3%. (SLIDE 23.) Our increased guidance further assumes like-for-like net revenue growth, excluding currency, of at least 6%, compared to the assumption of at least 5% in our prior guidance. We also now expect IQOS device net revenues to account for less than 20% of our total RRP net revenues in 2019. The change from the previously communicated range of 20% to 25% primarily reflects the favorable geographic mix impact related to HTU shipment volume that I noted earlier. We continue to anticipate a full-year like-for-like combustible pricing variance above 5%, supported by our June year-to-date variance of 5.2%. (SLIDE 24.) This positive top-line momentum provides us the opportunity to further increase or advance investments behind IQOS in order to: • Accelerate product and commercial development; • Expand distribution in both existing and new geographies during the second half of 2019; • Further enhance the IQOS 3 device in 2019 to reinforce the brand; and • Strengthen our category leadership as competition intensifies. Consequently, we now anticipate net incremental investments behind RRPs this year of approximately $400 million, compared to our previously disclosed estimate of approximately $300 million, with the majority of the $100 million step-up in investment expected to occur in the third quarter. We believe this increased investment will reinforce the positive momentum behind IQOS heading into 2020. 6 Despite the increased investment, we are maintaining our assumption of currency-neutral adjusted operating income margin expansion of at least 100 basis points on a like-for-like basis. (SLIDE 25.) While we don't give quarterly guidance, I believe it is appropriate to provide some additional visibility on the third-quarter, in which we expect currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS to be essentially flat compared to our pro forma adjusted diluted EPS of $1.35 in the third quarter of 2018. This estimate assumes a like-for-like currency-neutral net revenue growth rate in the quarter slightly below our full-year assumption. As I noted earlier, compared to last year our second-quarter net revenue growth benefited from the timing of price increases in certain markets, and some of this benefit will be offset in the third quarter. We also face a challenging combustible pricing comparison versus the third quarter of 2018, our strongest quarter for pricing last year. Coupled with our top-line assumption, our third-quarter EPS estimate also reflects higher expected costs on a like-for-like basis. This is primarily due to our net incremental investments behind RRPs, with around half of the full-year total of approximately $400 million expected to come in the quarter. (SLIDE 26.) Turning to cash flow, we continue to anticipate full-year operating cash flow of approximately $9.5 billion, subject to year-end working capital requirements, as well as capital expenditures of approximately $1.1 billion. (SLIDE 27.) In conclusion, we are building upon our promising start to the year, and delivered a very solid performance in the second quarter. The fundamentals supporting our strong combustible tobacco portfolio are intact. The favorable momentum for IQOS continues across geographies, further supporting our confidence in our HTU shipment volume target of 90 to 100 billion units by 2021. Finally, on a currency-neutral like-for-like basis, we have increased our full-year 2019 growth assumption for net revenues to at least 6% and our anticipated full-year 2019 growth rate for adjusted diluted EPS to at least 9%, further demonstrating our overall confidence in PMI's short and long-term growth prospects. (SLIDE 28.) Thank you. I am now happy to take your questions. 7 NICK ROLLI That concludes our call today. Thank you for joining us.

(RBH), effective March 22, 2019 2 Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements • This presentation and related discussion contain projections of future results and other forward-looking statements. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. In the event that risks or uncertainties materialize, or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those contained in such forward-looking statements. Pursuant to the ""safe harbor"" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, PMI is identifying important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward- looking statements made by PMI • PMI's business risks include: excise tax increases and discriminatory tax structures; increasing marketing and regulatory restrictions that could reduce our competitiveness, eliminate our ability to communicate with adult consumers, or ban certain of our products; health concerns relating to the use of tobacco products and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke; litigation related to tobacco use; intense competition; the effects of global and individual country economic, regulatory and political developments, natural disasters and conflicts; changes in adult smoker behavior; lost revenues as a result of counterfeiting, contraband and cross-border purchases; governmental investigations; unfavorable currency exchange rates and currency devaluations, and limitations on the ability to repatriate funds; adverse changes in applicable corporate tax laws; adverse changes in the cost and quality of tobacco and other agricultural products and raw materials; and the integrity of its information systems and effectiveness of its data privacy policies. PMI's future profitability may also be adversely affected should it be unsuccessful in its attempts to produce and commercialize reduced-risk products or if regulation or taxation do not differentiate between such products and cigarettes; if it is unable to successfully introduce new products, promote brand equity, enter new markets or improve its margins through increased prices and productivity gains; if it is unable to expand its brand portfolio internally or through acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships; or if it is unable to attract and retain the best global talent. Future results are also subject to the lower predictability of our reduced-risk product category's performance • PMI is further subject to other risks detailed from time to time in its publicly filed documents, including the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2019. PMI cautions that the foregoing list of important factors is not a complete discussion of all potential risks and uncertainties. PMI does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that it may make from time to time, except in the normal course of its public disclosure obligations 3 Delivered Very Solid Performance in Q2, 2019 • Positive momentum for combustible tobacco and smoke-free product portfolios • Strong currency-neutral adjusted financial results Source: PMI Financials or estimates 4 Q2, 2019: Better-than-Anticipated Total PMI Volume Shipments Like-for-Like Change vs. PY (billion units) Q2, 2019 H1, 2019 201.7 198.9 Total (0.7)% 0.1% 11.0 15.1 HTUs 37.0% 29.2% 190.7 183.8 Cigarettes (2.9)% (1.5)% Q2, 2018 Q2, 2019 Source: PMI Financials or estimates 5 Q2, 2019: Strong Adjusted Financial Results Growth vs. PY • Currency-neutral like-for-like net revenue (ex-currency, like-for-like basis) growth driven by: ⎼ Higher HTU shipment volume ⎼ Favorable pricing for combustible tobacco portfolio • Nearly $1.5 billion in RRP net revenues (or nearly 20% of PMI's total net revenues): ⎼ IQOS devices accounted for approximately 14% 9.0% Net Adjusted Adjusted Revenues OI Diluted EPS Source: PMI Financials or estimates 6 Q2, 2019: Strong Combustible Tobacco Pricing • Pricing variance of over 6%(a), on a like- for-like basis, driven notably by Germany, Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines, Russia and Turkey • Recently increased our cigarette prices in markets such as Mexico and Ukraine (a) Reflects combustible tobacco pricing as a % of PY combustible tobacco net revenues, on a like-for-like basis Source: PMI Financials or estimates 7 Q2, 2019: Strong Adjusted Financial Results Growth vs. PY • Currency-neutral like-for-like net revenue (ex-currency, like-for-like basis) growth driven by: ⎼ Higher HTU shipment volume ⎼ Favorable pricing for combustible tobacco portfolio • Nearly $1.5 billion in RRP net revenues (or nearly 20% of PMI's total net revenues): ⎼ IQOS devices accounted for approximately 14% • 240 bps currency-neutral like-for-like adjusted % % OI margin increase, driven primarily by a 9.0 15.7 favorable geographic mix related to HTUs Net Adjusted Adjusted Revenues OI Diluted EPS Source: PMI Financials or estimates 8 Q2, 2019: Strong Adjusted Financial Results Growth vs. PY • Currency-neutral like-for-like net revenue (ex-currency, like-for-like basis) growth driven by: ⎼ Higher HTU shipment volume ⎼ Favorable pricing for combustible tobacco portfolio • Nearly $1.5 billion in RRP net revenues (or nearly 20% of PMI's total net revenues): ⎼ IQOS devices accounted for approximately 14% • 240 bps currency-neutral like-for-like adjusted % % % OI margin increase, driven primarily by a 9.0 15.7 15.0 favorable geographic mix related to HTUs Net Adjusted Adjusted Revenues OI Diluted EPS Source: PMI Financials or estimates 9 Q2, 2019: Continued Total Share Growth, Driven by HTUs PMI Total International SoM(a) +0.1pp 28.2% 28.3% 1.6% HTUs 2.1% 26.6% Cigarettes 26.2% 20% Q2, 2018 Q2, 2019 (a) Sales volume of PMI cigarettes and HTUs as a percentage of the total industry sales volume for cigarettes and HTUs Note: Current view (reflecting the deconsolidation, PMI’s total market share has been restated for previous periods).

(""Altria""). Since that time the company has been independent and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (ticker symbol ""PM"") • ""RBH"" refers to PMI’s Canadian subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. • The Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA) is a Canadian federal law that permits a Canadian business to restructure its affairs while carrying on its business in the ordinary course • Trademarks are italicized • Comparisons are made to the same prior-year period unless otherwise stated • Unless otherwise stated, references to total industry, total market, PMI shipment volume and PMI market share performance reflect cigarettes and heated tobacco units • References to total international market, defined as worldwide cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume excluding the United States, total industry, total market and market shares are PMI estimates for tax-paid products based on the latest available data from a number of internal and external sources and may, in defined instances, exclude the People's Republic of China and/or PMI's duty free business. In addition, to reflect the deconsolidation of PMI's Canadian subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson & Hedges, Inc. (RBH), effective March 22, 2019, PMI's total market share has been restated for previous periods • ""OTP"" is defined as ""other tobacco products,"" primarily roll-your-own and make-your-own cigarettes, pipe tobacco, cigars and cigarillos, and does not include reduced-risk products • ""Combustible products"" is the term PMI uses to refer to cigarettes and OTP, combined • In-market sales, or ""IMS,"" is defined as sales to the retail channel, depending on the market and distribution model • ""Total shipment volume"" is defined as the combined total of cigarette shipment volume and heated tobacco unit shipment volume 31 Glossary: General Terms (cont.) • ""EU"" is defined as the European Union Region • ""EE"" is defined as the Eastern Europe Region • ""ME&A"" is defined as the Middle East & Africa Region and includes PMI's duty free business • ""S&SA"" is defined as the South & Southeast Asia Region • ""EA&A"" is defined as the East Asia & Australia Region • ""LA&C"" is defined as the Latin America & Canada Region • Following the deconsolidation of PMI's Canadian subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson & Hedges, Inc. (RBH), PMI will continue to report the volume of brands sold by RBH for which other PMI subsidiaries are the trademark owner. These include HEETS, Next, Philip Morris and Rooftop, which accounted for approximately 40% of RBH's total shipment volume in 2018 • From time to time, PMI’s shipment volumes are subject to the impact of distributor inventory movements, and estimated total industry/market volumes are subject to the impact of inventory movements in various trade channels that include estimated trade inventory movements of PMI’s competitors arising from market-specific factors that significantly distort reported volume disclosures. Such factors may include changes to the manufacturing supply chain, shipment methods, consumer demand, timing of excise tax increases or other influences that may affect the timing of sales to customers. In such instances, in addition to reviewing PMI shipment volumes and certain estimated total industry/market volumes on a reported basis, management reviews these measures on an adjusted basis that excludes the impact of distributor and/or estimated trade inventory movements. Management also believes that disclosing PMI shipment volumes and estimated total industry/market volumes in such circumstances on a basis that excludes the impact of distributor and/or estimated trade inventory movements, such as on an IMS basis, improves the comparability of performance and trends for these measures over different reporting periods • ""SoM"" stands for share of market 32 Glossary: Financial Terms • Net revenues related to combustible products refer to the operating revenues generated from the sale of these products, including shipping and handling charges billed to customers, net of sales and promotion incentives, and excise taxes. PMI recognizes revenue when control is transferred to the customer, typically either upon shipment or delivery of goods • Net revenues related to RRPs represent the sale of heated tobacco units, IQOS devices and related accessories, and other nicotine-containing products, primarily e-vapor products, including shipping and handling charges billed to customers, net of sales and promotion incentives, and excise taxes. PMI recognizes revenue when control is transferred to the customer, typically either upon shipment or delivery of goods • ""Adjusted Operating Income (OI) Margin"" is calculated as adjusted OI, divided by net revenues • Management reviews net revenues, OI, OI margins, operating cash flow and earnings per share, or ""EPS,"" on an adjusted basis, which may exclude the impact of currency and other items such as acquisitions, asset impairment and exit costs, tax items and other special items. For example, PMI’s adjusted diluted EPS and other impacted results reflect the loss on deconsolidation of RBH and the Canadian tobacco litigation-related expense, recorded in the first quarter of 2019. PMI believes that the adjusted measures, including pro forma measures, will provide useful insight into underlying business trends and results, and will provide a more meaningful performance comparison for the period during which RBH remains under CCAA protection. For PMI's 2018 pro forma adjusted diluted EPS by quarter and year-to-date, see Schedule 3 in PMI's second-quarter 2019 earnings release 33 Glossary: Reduced-Risk Products • ""Reduced-risk products,"" or ""RRPs,"" is the term PMI uses to refer to products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to smokers who switch to these products versus continued smoking. PMI has a range of RRPs in various stages of development, scientific assessment and commercialization. Because PMI's RRPs do not burn tobacco, they produce an aerosol that contains far lower quantities of harmful and potentially harmful constituents than found in cigarette smoke • ""Aerosol"" refers to a gaseous suspension of fine solid particles and/or liquid droplets • ""Combustion"" is the process of burning a substance in oxygen, producing heat and often light • ""Smoke"" is a visible suspension of solid particles, liquid droplets and gases in air, emitted when a material burns • ""Heated tobacco product,"" or ""HTP,"" is a manufactured tobacco product that delivers a nicotine containing vapor (aerosol), without combustion of the tobacco mixture • ""Heated tobacco units,"" or ""HTUs,"" is the term PMI uses to refer to heated tobacco consumables, which for PMI include the company's HEETS, HEETS Marlboro and HEETS FROM MARLBORO, defined collectively as HEETS, as well as Marlboro HeatSticks and Parliament HeatSticks • Unless otherwise stated, all references to IQOS are to PMI's heat-not-burn products • The IQOS heat-not-burn device is a precisely controlled heating device into which a specially designed and proprietary tobacco unit is inserted and heated to generate an aerosol • HTU ""offtake volume"" represents the estimated retail offtake of HTUs based on a selection of sales channels that vary by market, but notably include retail points of sale and e-commerce platforms • HTU ""offtake share"" represents the estimated retail offtake volume of HTUs divided by the sum of estimated total offtake volume for cigarettes and HTUs 34 Glossary: Reduced-Risk Products (cont.) • National market share for HTUs is defined as the total sales volume for HTUs as a percentage of the total estimated sales volume for cigarettes and HTUs • ""Total IQOS users"" means the estimated number of Legal Age (minimum 18-year-old) IQOS users that used PMI HTUs for at least 5% of their daily tobacco consumption over the past seven days • ""Converted IQOS Users"" means the estimated number of Legal Age (minimum 18-year-old) IQOS users that used PMI HTUs for over 95% of their daily tobacco consumption over the past seven days • ""Predominant IQOS Users"" means the estimated number of Legal Age (minimum 18-year-old) IQOS users that used PMI HTUs units for between 70% and 95% of their daily tobacco consumption over the past seven days • ""Situational IQOS Users"" means the estimated number of Legal Age (minimum 18-year-old) IQOS users that used PMI HTUs for between 5% and less than 70% of their daily tobacco consumption over the past seven days • ""Abandoned IQOS Users"" means the estimated number of Legal Age (minimum 18-year-old) IQOS users that used PMI HTUs for less than 5% of their daily tobacco consumption over the past seven days • New PMI methodology as of 2018 for estimating the number of people who have stopped smoking and made the change to IQOS: for markets where IQOS is the only heated tobacco product, daily individual consumption of PMI HTUs represents the totality of their daily tobacco consumption in the past seven days. For markets where IQOS is one among other heated tobacco products, daily individual consumption of HTUs represents the totality of their daily tobacco consumption in the past seven days, of which at least 70% are PMI HTUs • ""FDA"" stands for the U.S. Food & Drug Administration • ""MRTP"" stands for Modified Risk Tobacco Product, the term used by the U.S. FDA to refer to RRPs • ""MRTP application"" stands for Modified Risk Tobacco Product application under section 911 of the FD&C Act • ""PMTA"" stands for Premarket Tobacco Application under section 910 of the FD&C Act 35 PHILIP MORRIS INTERNATIONAL INC. and Subsidiaries Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures Reconciliation of Reported Diluted EPS to Reported Diluted EPS, excluding Currency, and Reconciliation of Reported Diluted EPS to Adjusted Diluted EPS, excluding Currency (Unaudited) Quarters Ended June 30, 2019 2018 % Change Reported Diluted EPS $ 1.49 $ 1.41 5.7% Currency (0.07) Reported Diluted EPS, excluding Currency $ 1.56 $ 1.41 10.6% Quarters Ended June 30, Year Ended 2019 2018 % Change 2018 Reported Diluted EPS $ 1.49 $ 1.41 5.7% $ 5.08 Asset impairment and exit costs 0.01 - - Tax items (0.04) - 0.02 Adjusted Diluted EPS $ 1.46 $ 1.41 3.5% $ 5.10 Currency (0.07) Adjusted Diluted EPS, excluding Currency $ 1.53 $ 1.41 8.5% 36 PHILIP MORRIS INTERNATIONAL INC. and Subsidiaries Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures Adjustments for the Impact of RBH, excluding Currency (Unaudited) Quarters Ended June 30, 2019 2018 % Change Adjusted Diluted EPS (a) $ 1.46 $ 1.41 3.5% Net earnings attributable to RBH (0.08) Adjusted Diluted EPS $ 1.46 $ 1.33 (b) 9.8% Currency (0.07) Adjusted Diluted EPS, excluding Currency $ 1.53 $ 1.33 (b) 15.0% (a) For the calculation, see previous slide (b) Pro forma 37 PHILIP MORRIS INTERNATIONAL INC. and Subsidiaries Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures Net Revenues by Product Category and Adjustments of Net Revenues for the Impact of Currency and Acquisitions ($ in millions) / (Unaudited) Net Net Revenues Excluding Net Revenues Quarters Ended Net Excluding Currency Acquisitions excluding Total Currency & Revenues excluding June 30, Revenues Currency Currency & Acquisitions Currency Acquisitions 2019 Reduced-Risk Products 2018 % Change $ 428 $ (36) $ 464 $ - $ 464 European Union $ 182 +100% +100% +100% 182 (15) 197 - 197 Eastern Europe 65 +100% +100% +100% 86 (3) 89 - 89 Middle East & Africa 112 (22.8)% (20.3)% (20.3)% - - - - - South & Southeast Asia - - - - 765 (7) 772 - 772 East Asia & Australia 656 16.6% 17.7% 17.7% 5 - 5 - 5 Latin America & Canada 5 (2.4)% 6.1% 6.1% $ 1,466 $ (62) $ 1,528 $ - $ 1,528 Total RRPs $ 1,020 43.7% 49.8% 49.8% 2019 PMI 2018 % Change $ 2,577 $ (216) $ 2,793 $ - $ 2,793 European Union $ 2,503 3.0% 11.6% 11.6% 822 (66) 888 - 888 Eastern Europe 760 8.2% 16.8% 16.8% 1,004 (90) 1,094 - 1,094 Middle East & Africa 1,022 (1.8)% 7.0% 7.0% 1,248 (32) 1,280 - 1,280 South & Southeast Asia 1,156 8.0% 10.7% 10.7% 1,521 (25) 1,546 - 1,546 East Asia & Australia 1,478 2.9% 4.6% 4.6% 527 (18) 545 - 545 Latin America & Canada 807 (34.7)% (32.5)% (32.5)% $ 7,699 $ (447) $ 8,146 $ - $ 8,146 Total PMI $ 7,726 (0.3)% 5.4% 5.4% Note: Sum of Regions might not foot to Total PMI due to roundings.

(NYSE: PM) today announced its 2019 second-quarter results and increases its 2019 full-year reported diluted earnings per share forecast. Comparisons presented in this press release on a ""like-for-like"" basis reflect pro forma 2018 results, which have been adjusted for the deconsolidation of PMI's Canadian subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson & Hedges, Inc. (RBH), effective March 22, 2019 (the date of deconsolidation). In addition, reflecting the deconsolidation, PMI's total market share has been restated for previous periods. 2019 SECOND-QUARTER & YEAR-TO-DATE HIGHLIGHTS 2019 Second-Quarter • Reported diluted EPS of $1.49 , up by 5.7% ; up by 10.6% , excluding currency • Adjusted diluted EPS of $1.46 , up by 3.5% ; up by 15.0% on a like-for-like basis, excluding currency • Cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume down by 1.4% (down by 0.7% on a like-for-like basis), reflecting cigarette shipment volume down by 3.6% and heated tobacco unit shipment volume up by 37.0% • Net revenues down by 0.3% ; up by 9.0% on a like-for-like basis, excluding currency • Operating income up by 3.0% ; up by 8.4% , excluding currency • Adjusted operating income up by 15.7% on a like-for-like basis, excluding currency • Adjusted operating income margin, excluding currency, increased by 2.4 points to 41.4% on a like-for-like basis • PMI declared a regular quarterly dividend of $1.14 , representing an annualized rate of $4.56 per common share • The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced that the marketing of IQOS , PMI's electrically heated tobacco system, is appropriate for the protection of public health and authorized it for sale in the United States 2019 Six Months Year-to-Date • Reported diluted EPS of $2.36 , down by 2.1% ; up by 3.3% , excluding currency • Adjusted diluted EPS of $2.55 , up by 5.8% ; up by 15.0% on a like-for-like basis, excluding currency • Cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume down by 0.2% ( up by 0.1% on a like-for-like basis), reflecting cigarette shipment volume down by 1.9% and heated tobacco unit shipment volume up by 29.2% • Net revenues down by 1.2% ; up by 6.2% on a like-for-like basis, excluding currency • Operating income down by 5.1% ; up by 0.5% , excluding currency • Adjusted operating income up by 12.7% on a like-for-like basis, excluding currency • Adjusted operating income margin, excluding currency, increased by 2.2 points to 39.4% on a like-for-like basis ""Building on our encouraging start to the year, we delivered another strong quarter that continues to demonstrate the soundness of our strategies and the quality of our execution, "" said André Calantzopoulos, Chief Executive Officer . ""Of particular note is our combined cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume, which -- for the first six months of the year -- was up by 0.1% on a like-for-like basis. This positive performance was led by robust in-market heated tobacco unit year-to-date sales growth of 34.0% , making HEETS/HeatSticks, combined, a top-ten international tobacco brand, despite only being present in approximately one quarter of our markets. In the markets where they are sold, our heated tobacco brands held a sizable combined share of 5.0% year-to-date, driving a total international share of 2.1% , up by 0.6 points."" ""Our strong year-to-date results are the reason behind today's announcement to increase our full-year guidance and raise our currency-neutral, like-for-like 2019 full-year adjusted diluted EPS growth rate by one percentage point to at least 9% in a further demonstration of our overall confidence in PMI's short and long-term growth prospects.

PMI revises its full-year 2019 reported diluted EPS forecast to be at least $4.94 at prevailing exchange rates, compared to the previously communicated forecast of at least $4.87, versus $5.08 in 2018. This revised full-year guidance reflects: • The net impact of the loss on deconsolidation of PMI's Canadian subsidiary Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. (RBH) under U.S. GAAP of approximately $ 0.12 per share, recorded in the first quarter of 2019, which is a non-cash item, as well as the Canadian tobacco litigation-related expense of approximately $ 0.09 per share; - -2 - • The exclusion, announced on March 22, 2019, of RBH’s previously anticipated net earnings from PMI’s consolidated financial statements, from March 22, 2019 (the date of deconsolidation) to December 31, 2019, of approximately $0.28 per share; • Asset impairment and exit costs of approximately $ 0.03 per share resulting from plant closures as part of global manufacturing infrastructure optimization, reflecting: $0.01 per share related to Pakistan recorded in the first quarter of 2019; and $0.02 per share related to Colombia ($0.01 per share recorded in the second quarter of 2019 and $0.01 per share anticipated in the third quarter of 2019); • A favorable tax item of $0.04 per share related to a reduction in estimated U.S. federal income tax on dividend repatriation for the years 2015-2018; • An unfavorable currency impact, at prevailing exchange rates, of approximately $0.14 ; • A full-year effective tax rate of approximately 23%, excluding discrete tax items and Loss on Deconsolidation of RBH; and • A projected increase of at least 9%, excluding currency, versus pro forma adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.84 in 2018, as detailed in the attached Schedule 3 and as shown in the 2019 EPS Forecast table above. 2019 Full-Year Forecast Overview & Assumptions This forecast assumes: • A total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume decline for PMI of approximately 1.0%, on a like-for-like basis, compared to the previously disclosed range of approximately 1.5% to 2.0%; • An estimated total international industry volume decline, excluding China and the U.S., at the lower end of the previously disclosed range of approximately 2.5% to 3.0%; and • Currency-neutral net revenue growth of at least 6% on a like-for-like basis, compared to the previously disclosed assumption of at least 5%, which includes an adverse impact of approximately 0.7 points related to the move to highly inflationary accounting in Argentina resulting in the treatment of the U.S. dollar as the functional currency of the company’s Argentinian affiliates. This forecast further assumes: • Net incremental investment behind RRPs of approximately $400 million for the full year 2019, compared to the previously disclosed estimate of approximately $300 million. Approximately half of the total net incremental investment of $400 million is expected in the third quarter; • An increase in full-year currency-neutral, like-for-like adjusted operating income margin of at least 100 basis points compared to 2018; • Operating cash flow of approximately $9.5 billion, subject to year-end working capital requirements; • Capital expenditures of approximately $1.1 billion; and • No share repurchases. This forecast excludes the impact of any future acquisitions, unanticipated asset impairment and exit cost charges, future changes in currency exchange rates, further developments related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, further developments pertaining to the judgment in the two Québec Class Action lawsuits and the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA) protection granted to RBH and any unusual events. This forecast also excludes the contemplated proposal, previously communicated by PMI's local affiliate, to end cigarette production in Berlin, - -3 - Germany, by January 2020. Factors described in the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements section of this release represent continuing risks to these projections. FDA Authorization for Sale of IQOS in the United States On April 30, 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that the marketing of IQOS , PMI's electrically heated tobacco system, is appropriate for the protection of public health and authorized it for sale in the United States. The FDA’s decision follows its comprehensive assessment of PMI’s premarket tobacco product applications (PMTAs) submitted to the Agency in 2017. PMI will bring IQOS to the U.S. through an exclusive license with Altria Group, Inc., whose subsidiary, Philip Morris USA, will market the product and comply with the provisions set forth in the FDA's marketing order, and has the expertise and infrastructure to ensure a successful launch, beginning with the initial lead market of Atlanta, Georgia.

The FDA has placed stringent marketing restrictions on the products in an effort to prevent youth access and exposure. Following a rigorous science-based review through the premarket tobacco product application (PMTA) pathway, the agency determined that authorizing these products for the U.S. market is appropriate for the protection of the public health because, among several key considerations, the products produce fewer or lower levels of some toxins than combustible cigarettes. The products authorized for sale include the IQOS device, Marlboro Heatsticks, Marlboro Smooth Menthol Heatsticks and Marlboro Fresh Menthol Heatsticks. While today’s action permits the tobacco products to be sold in the U.S., it does not mean these products are safe or “FDA approved.” All tobacco products are potentially harmful and addictive and those who do not use tobacco products should continue not to. Additionally, today’s action is not a decision on the separate modified risk tobacco product (MRTP) applications that the company also submitted for these products to market them with claims of reduced exposure or reduced risk. “Ensuring new tobacco products undergo a robust premarket evaluation by the FDA is a critical part of our mission to protect the public, particularly youth, and to reduce tobacco-related disease and death. While the authorization of new tobacco products doesn’t mean they are safe, the review process makes certain that the marketing of the products is appropriate for the protection of the public health, taking into account the risks and benefits to the population as a whole. This includes how the products may impact youth use of nicotine and tobacco, and the potential for the products to completely move adult smokers away from use of combustible cigarettes,” said Mitch Zeller, J.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products. “Importantly, the FDA is putting in place postmarket requirements aimed at, among other things, monitoring market dynamics such as potential youth uptake. We’ll be keeping a close watch on the marketplace, including how the company is marketing these products, and will take action as necessary to ensure the continued sale of these products in the U.S. remains appropriate and make certain that the company complies with the agency’s marketing restrictions to prevent youth access and exposure. As other manufacturers seek to market new tobacco products, the FDA remains committed to upholding the vital public health standards under the law and using all the tools at our disposal to ensure the efficient and appropriate oversight of tobacco products.” Under the PMTA pathway, manufacturers must demonstrate to the agency, among other things, that marketing of the new tobacco product would be appropriate for the protection of the public health. That standard requires the FDA to consider the risks and benefits to the population as a whole, including users and non-users of tobacco products. Importantly this includes youth. The agency’s evaluation includes reviewing a tobacco product’s components, ingredients, additives and health risks, as well as how the product is manufactured, packaged and - -27 - labeled. The review for the IQOS products took into account the increased or decreased likelihood that existing tobacco product users will stop using tobacco products, and the increased or decreased likelihood that those who do not use tobacco products will start using them. In particular, through the FDA’s scientific evaluation of the company’s applications, peer-reviewed published literature and other sources, the agency found that the aerosol produced by the IQOS Tobacco Heating System contains fewer toxic chemicals than cigarette smoke, and many of the toxins identified are present at lower levels than in cigarette smoke. For example, the carbon monoxide exposure from IQOS aerosol is comparable to environmental exposure, and levels of acrolein and formaldehyde are 89% to 95% and 66% to 91% lower than from combustible cigarettes, respectively. Additionally, IQOS delivers nicotine in levels close to combustible cigarettes suggesting a likelihood that IQOS users may be able to completely transition away from combustible cigarettes and use IQOS exclusively. Available data, while limited, also indicate that few non-tobacco users would be likely to choose to start using IQOS, including youth. While these non-combusted cigarettes may be referred to as “heat-not-burn” or “heated” tobacco products, they meet the definition of a cigarette in the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Therefore, these products must adhere to existing restrictions for cigarettes under FDA regulations, as well as other federal laws that, among other things, prohibit television and radio advertising. In addition, to further limit youth access to the products and exposure to their advertising and promotion, the FDA is placing stringent restrictions on how the products are marketed – particularly via websites and through social media platforms – by including requirements that advertising be targeted to adults. The company must also give notification to the FDA of, among other things, its labeling, advertising, marketing plans, including information about specific adult target audiences, and how it plans to restrict youth access and limit youth exposure to the products’ labeling, advertising, marketing and promotion. The agency has issued a document providing its rationale for these postmarket requirements, which highlight important considerations for reviewing the company’s applications as well any potential future PMTAs for other products. The FDA also is requiring all package labels and advertisements for these products to include a warning about the addictiveness of nicotine, in addition to other warnings required for cigarettes, to prevent consumer misperceptions about the relative addiction risk of using IQOS compared to combusted cigarettes. With the authorization of these products, the FDA will evaluate new available data regarding the products through postmarketing records and reports required in the marketing order. The company is required to report regularly to the FDA with information regarding the products on the market, including, but not limited to, ongoing and completed consumer research studies, advertising, marketing plans, sales data, information on current and new users, manufacturing changes and adverse experiences. The FDA may withdraw a marketing order if it, among other reasons, determines that the continued marketing of a product is no longer appropriate for the protection of the public health, such as if there is an uptake of the product by youth. The FDA is continuing its substantive scientific review of the company’s MRTP applications. The company would need to receive an MRTP order from the FDA before they could market a tobacco product with any implicit or explicit claims that, among other things, a product reduces exposure to certain chemicals or that use of the product is less harmful than another tobacco product or would reduce the risk of disease. If a company markets a tobacco product as an MRTP without authorization, the company would be in violation of the law and may face FDA advisory or enforcement actions. #### - -28 - Philip Morris International: Delivering a Smoke-Free Future Philip Morris International (PMI) is leading a transformation in the tobacco industry to create a smoke-free future and ultimately replace cigarettes with smoke-free products to the benefit of adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, society, the company and its shareholders. PMI is a leading international tobacco company engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes, smoke-free products and associated electronic devices and accessories, and other nicotine-containing products in markets outside the U.S. PMI is building a future on a new category of smoke-free products that, while not risk-free, are a much better choice than continuing to smoke. Through multidisciplinary capabilities in product development, state-of-the-art facilities and scientific substantiation, PMI aims to ensure that its smoke-free products meet adult consumer preferences and rigorous regulatory requirements. PMI's smoke-free IQOS product portfolio includes heat-not-burn and nicotine-containing vapor products. As of June 30, 2019 , PMI estimates that approximately 8.0 million adult smokers around the world have already stopped smoking and switched to PMI’s heat-not-burn product, available for sale in 48 markets in key cities or nationwide under the IQOS brand.

Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements This press release contains projections of future results and other forward-looking statements. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and inaccurate assumptions. In the event that risks or uncertainties materialize, or underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could vary materially from those contained in such forward-looking statements. Pursuant to the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, PMI is identifying important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by PMI. PMI's business risks include: excise tax increases and discriminatory tax structures; increasing marketing and regulatory restrictions that could reduce our competitiveness, eliminate our ability to communicate with adult consumers, or ban certain of our products; health concerns relating to the use of tobacco products and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke; litigation related to tobacco use; intense competition; the effects of global and individual country economic, regulatory and political developments, natural disasters and conflicts; changes in adult smoker behavior; lost revenues as a result of counterfeiting, contraband and cross-border purchases; governmental investigations; unfavorable currency exchange rates and currency devaluations, and limitations on the ability to repatriate funds; adverse changes in applicable corporate tax laws; adverse changes in the cost and quality of tobacco and other agricultural products and raw materials; and the integrity of its information systems and effectiveness of its data privacy policies. PMI's future profitability may also be adversely affected should it be unsuccessful in its attempts to produce and commercialize reduced-risk products or if regulation or taxation do not differentiate between such products and cigarettes; if it is unable to successfully introduce new products, promote brand equity, enter new markets or improve its margins through increased prices and productivity gains; if it is unable to expand its brand portfolio internally or through acquisitions and the development of strategic business relationships; or if it is unable to attract and retain the best global talent. Future results are also subject to the lower predictability of our reduced-risk product category's performance. PMI is further subject to other risks detailed from time to time in its publicly filed documents, including the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2019. PMI cautions that the foregoing list of important factors is not a complete discussion of all potential risks and uncertainties. PMI does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that it may make from time to time, except in the normal course of its public disclosure obligations. - -29 - Key Terms, Definitions and Explanatory Notes General • ""PMI"" refers to Philip Morris International Inc. and its subsidiaries. Trademarks and service marks that are the registered property of, or licensed by, the subsidiaries of PMI, are italicized. • Comparisons are made to the same prior-year period unless otherwise stated. • Unless otherwise stated, references to total industry, total market, PMI shipment volume and PMI market share performance reflect cigarettes and heated tobacco units. • [REVISED] References to total international market, defined as worldwide cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume excluding the United States, total industry, total market and market shares are PMI estimates for tax-paid products based on the latest available data from a number of internal and external sources and may, in defined instances, exclude the People's Republic of China and/or PMI's duty free business. In addition, to reflect the deconsolidation of PMI's Canadian subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson & Hedges, Inc. (RBH), effective March 22, 2019, PMI's total market share has been restated for previous periods. • ""OTP"" is defined as ""other tobacco products,"" primarily roll-your-own and make-your-own cigarettes, pipe tobacco, cigars and cigarillos, and does not include reduced-risk products. • ""Combustible products"" is the term PMI uses to refer to cigarettes and OTP, combined. • In-market sales, or ""IMS,"" is defined as sales to the retail channel, depending on the market and distribution model. • ""Total shipment volume"" is defined as the combined total of cigarette shipment volume and heated tobacco unit shipment volume. • ""North Africa"" is defined as Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia. • ""The GCC"" (Gulf Cooperation Council) is defined as Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). • Following the deconsolidation of PMI's Canadian subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson & Hedges, Inc. (RBH), PMI will continue to report the volume of brands sold by RBH for which other PMI subsidiaries are the trademark owner. These include HEETS , Next , Philip Morris and Rooftop , which accounted for approximately 40% of RBH's total shipment volume in 2018. • [REVISED] From time to time, PMI’s shipment volumes are subject to the impact of distributor inventory movements, and estimated total industry/market volumes are subject to the impact of inventory movements in various trade channels that include estimated trade inventory movements of PMI’s competitors arising from market-specific factors that significantly distort reported volume disclosures. Such factors may include changes to the manufacturing supply chain, shipment methods, consumer demand, timing of excise tax increases or other influences that may affect the timing of sales to customers. In such instances, in addition to reviewing PMI shipment volumes and certain estimated total industry/market volumes on a reported basis, management reviews these measures on an adjusted basis that excludes the impact of distributor and/or estimated trade inventory movements. Management also believes that disclosing PMI shipment volumes and estimated total industry/market volumes in such circumstances on a basis that excludes the impact of distributor and/or estimated trade inventory movements, such as on an IMS basis, improves the comparability of performance and trends for these measures over different reporting periods. Financial • Net revenues related to combustible products refer to the operating revenues generated from the sale of these products, including shipping and handling charges billed to customers, net of sales and promotion incentives, and excise taxes. PMI recognizes revenue when control is transferred to the customer, typically either upon shipment or delivery of goods. • Net revenues related to RRPs represent the sale of heated tobacco units, IQOS devices and related accessories, and other nicotine-containing products, primarily e-vapor products, including shipping and handling charges billed to customers, net of sales and promotion incentives, and excise taxes. PMI recognizes revenue when control is transferred to the customer, typically either upon shipment or delivery of goods. • ""Cost of sales"" consists principally of: tobacco leaf, non-tobacco raw materials, labor and manufacturing costs; shipping and handling costs; and the cost of IQOS devices produced by third-party electronics manufacturing service providers. Estimated costs associated with IQOS warranty programs are generally provided for in cost of sales in the period the related revenues are recognized. - -30 - • ""Marketing, administration and research costs"" include the costs of marketing and selling our products, other costs generally not related to the manufacture of our products (including general corporate expenses), and costs incurred to develop new products. The most significant components of our marketing, administration and research costs are marketing and sales expenses and general and administrative expenses. • [REVISED] ""Cost/Other"" in the Consolidated Financial Summary table of total PMI and the six reporting segments of this release reflects the currency-neutral variances of: cost of sales (excluding the volume/mix cost component); marketing, administration and research costs (including asset impairment and exit costs, the Canadian tobacco litigation-related expense and the charge related to the deconsolidation of RBH in Canada); and amortization of intangibles. “Cost/Other” also includes the currency-neutral net revenue variance, unrelated to volume/mix and price components, attributable to fees for certain distribution rights billed to customers in certain markets in the ME&A Region, as well as the impact of the deconsolidation in RBH. • ""Adjusted Operating Income Margin"" is calculated as adjusted operating income, divided by net revenues. • ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and equity (income)/loss in unconsolidated subsidiaries, excluding asset impairment and exit costs, and unusual items. • ""Net debt"" is defined as total debt, less cash and cash equivalents. • Management reviews net revenues, OI, OI margins, operating cash flow and earnings per share, or ""EPS,"" on an adjusted basis, which may exclude the impact of currency and other items such as acquisitions, asset impairment and exit costs, tax items and other special items. For example, PMI’s adjusted diluted EPS and other impacted results reflect the loss on deconsolidation of RBH and the Canadian tobacco litigation-related expense, recorded in the first quarter of 2019. PMI believes that the adjusted measures, including pro forma measures, will provide useful insight into underlying business trends and results, and will provide a more meaningful performance comparison for the period during which RBH remains under CCAA protection. For PMI's 2018 pro forma adjusted diluted EPS by quarter and year-to-date, see Schedule 3 in PMI's second-quarter 2019 earnings release. • Management reviews these measures because they exclude changes in currency exchange rates and other factors that may distort underlying business trends, thereby improving the comparability of PMI’s business performance between reporting periods. Furthermore, PMI uses several of these measures in its management compensation program to promote internal fairness and a disciplined assessment of performance against company targets. PMI discloses these measures to enable investors to view the business through the eyes of management. • Non-GAAP measures used in this release should neither be considered in isolation nor as a substitute for the financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures, see the relevant schedules provided with this press release. • U.S. GAAP Treatment of Argentina as a Highly Inflationary Economy. Following the categorization of Argentina by the International Practices Task Force of the Center for Audit Quality as a country with a three-year cumulative inflation rate greater than 100%, the country is considered highly inflationary in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Consequently, PMI began to account for the operations of its Argentinian affiliates as highly inflationary, and to treat the U.S. dollar as the functional currency of the affiliates, effective July 1, 2018. The move to highly inflationary accounting in Argentina reduced PMI's currency-neutral net revenue growth by approximately 0.6 points in 2018. Reduced-Risk Products • ""Reduced-risk products,"" or ""RRPs,"" is the term PMI uses to refer to products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to smokers who switch to these products versus continued smoking. PMI has a range of RRPs in various stages of development, scientific assessment and commercialization. Because PMI's RRPs do not burn tobacco, they produce an aerosol that contains far lower quantities of harmful and potentially harmful constituents than found in cigarette smoke. • ""Heated tobacco units,"" or ""HTUs,"" is the term PMI uses to refer to heated tobacco consumables, which include the company's HEETS , HEETS Marlboro and HEETS FROM MARLBORO , defined collectively as HEETS , as well as Marlboro HeatSticks and Parliament HeatSticks . • Unless otherwise stated, all references to IQOS are to PMI's heat-not-burn products. • The IQOS heat-not-burn device is a precisely controlled heating device into which a specially designed and proprietary tobacco unit is inserted and heated to generate an aerosol. - -31 - Appendix 1 PHILIP MORRIS INTERNATIONAL INC. and Subsidiaries Key Market Data Quarters Ended June 30, Market Total Market, bio units PMI Shipments, bio units PMI Market Share, % (1) Total Cigarette HTU Total HTU 2019 2018 % Change 2019 2018 % Change 2019 2018 % Change 2019 2018 % Change 2019 2018 pp Change 2019 2018 pp Change Total PMI 696.0 702.5 (0.9 ) 198.9 201.7 (1.4 ) 183.8 190.7 (3.6 ) 15.1 11.0 37.0 28.3 28.2 0.1 2.1 1.6 0.5 European Union France 9.8 10.5 (6.6 ) 4.5 5.0 (10.6 ) 4.5 5.0 (10.8 ) — — — 44.7 45.2 (0.5 ) 0.2 0.1 0.1 Germany 18.9 19.6 (3.4 ) 7.3 7.4 (2.0 ) 7.1 7.3 (3.8 ) 0.2 0.1 +100 38.5 38.0 0.5 1.1 0.4 0.7 Italy 17.1 17.7 (3.1 ) 9.3 9.3 0.1 8.5 9.0 (5.5 ) 0.8 0.3 +100 51.8 51.3 0.5 4.6 1.9 2.7 Poland 12.3 11.4 8.0 5.0 4.7 6.7 4.8 4.6 2.9 0.3 0.1 +100 40.8 41.3 (0.5 ) 2.0 0.6 1.4 Spain 11.6 11.6 (0.6 ) 3.9 3.9 (0.9 ) 3.8 3.8 (1.7 ) 0.1 0.1 60.8 31.2 31.8 (0.6 ) 0.7 0.4 0.3 Eastern Europe Russia 59.8 62.1 (3.8 ) 17.7 17.5 1.1 15.9 16.9 (6.1 ) 1.8 0.6 +100 29.6 28.1 1.5 2.9 0.8 2.1 Middle East & Africa Saudi Arabia 5.4 5.0 6.7 0.8 1.7 (50.2 ) 0.8 1.7 (50.2 ) — — — 38.9 40.1 (1.2 ) — — — Turkey 31.3 28.6 9.2 12.5 13.5 (7.6 ) 12.5 13.5 (7.6 ) — — — 39.9 47.2 (7.3 ) — — — South & Southeast Asia Indonesia 78.8 75.2 4.8 24.9 25.0 (0.1 ) 24.9 25.0 (0.1 ) — — — 31.7 33.2 (1.5 ) — — — Philippines 18.6 18.9 (1.5 ) 13.1 13.2 (0.4 ) 13.1 13.2 (0.4 ) — — — 70.4 69.6 0.8 — — — East Asia & Australia Australia 2.9 3.3 (10.8 ) 0.9 1.0 (7.6 ) 0.9 1.0 (7.6 ) — — — 31.0 29.9 1.1 — — — Japan 40.6 42.4 (4.3 ) 15.1 15.1 (0.4 ) 8.0 8.7 (8.5 ) 7.1 6.4 10.6 33.9 34.4 (0.5 ) 16.6 15.5 1.1 Korea 17.7 17.9 (1.2 ) 4.1 4.5 (9.8 ) 2.8 3.1 (9.9 ) 1.3 1.4 (9.5 ) 23.1 25.3 (2.2 ) 7.3 8.0 (0.7 ) Latin America & Canada Argentina 7.8 8.6 (9.9 ) 5.6 6.2 (10.0 ) 5.6 6.2 (10.0 ) — — — 72.1 72.2 (0.1 ) — — — Mexico 10.0 9.2 8.3 7.0 6.1 13.4 7.0 6.1 13.4 — — — 69.5 66.4 3.1 — — — (1) Market share estimates are calculated using IMS data Note: % change for Total Market and PMI shipments is computed based on millions of units; PMI Market Share estimates for previous periods are restated to reflect RBH deconsolidation and exclude RBH-owned brands.
