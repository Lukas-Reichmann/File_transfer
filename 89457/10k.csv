Pratt & Whitney is among the world’s leading suppliers of aircraft engines for commercial, military, business jet and general aviation customers. Pratt & Whitney’s Commercial Engines and Military Engines businesses design, develop, produce and maintain families of large engines for wide- and narrow-body and large regional aircraft for commercial customers and for fighter, bomber, tanker and transport aircraft for military customers. Pratt & Whitney’s small engine business, Pratt & Whitney Canada (P&WC), is among the world’s leading suppliers of engines powering regional airlines, general and business aviation, as well as helicopters. Pratt & Whitney also produces, sells and services military and commercial auxiliary power units. Pratt & Whitney provides fleet management services and aftermarket maintenance, repair and overhaul services in all of these segments. Pratt & Whitney sells products and services principally to aircraft manufacturers, airlines and other aircraft operators, aircraft leasing companies and the U.S. and foreign governments. Pratt & Whitney’s largest commercial customer by sales is Airbus, with sales, prior to discounts and incentives, of 33%, 31% and 30% of total Pratt & Whitney segment sales in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Pratt & Whitney produces the PW1000G Geared Turbofan (GTF) engine family, the first of which, the PW1100G-JM, entered into service in January 2016. The PW1000G GTF engine has demonstrated a significant reduction in fuel burn and noise levels and lower environmental emissions when compared to legacy engines. The PW1100G-JM engine is offered on the Airbus A320neo family of aircraft. PW1000G GTF engine models also power the Airbus A220 passenger aircraft and Embraer’s E-Jet E2 family of aircraft. In addition, P&WC’s PW800 engine has been selected to exclusively power Gulfstream’s G400, G500 and G600 business jets, as well as to power Dassault’s Falcon 6X business jet, which is scheduled to enter into service in 2023. Pratt & Whitney is under contract to produce and sustain the F135 engine for the U.S. government’s F-35 Joint Program Office to power the single-engine F-35 Lightning II aircraft (commonly known as the Joint Strike Fighter) produced by Lockheed Martin. F135 propulsion system configurations are used for the U.S Air Force’s F-35A, the U.S. Marine Corps’ F-35B and the U.S. Navy’s F-35C jets. F135 engines are also used on F-35 aircraft purchased by Joint Strike Fighter partner countries and other countries through foreign military sales arrangements. Pratt & Whitney is also under contract to build engines for the U.S. Air Force’s B-21 long-range strike bomber and to develop next-generation adaptive engines for the U.S. Air Force. The development of new engines and improvements to current production engines present important growth opportunities for Pratt & Whitney. In view of the risks and costs associated with developing new engines, Pratt & Whitney has entered into collaboration arrangements in which revenues, costs and risks are shared with third parties. At December 31, 2022, the interests of third-party collaboration participants in Pratt & Whitney-directed jet engine programs ranged, in the aggregate per program, from 13% to 49%. See “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a description of our accounting for collaboration arrangements. Pratt & Whitney also continues to enhance its programs through performance improvement measures and product base expansion, utilizing similar collaboration arrangements. In 2022, Pratt & Whitney reached significant milestones on the GTF engine program, including surpassing a billion gallons of fuel saved and 10 million metric tons of carbon emissions avoided since entry into service. The GTF Advantage engine for the A320neo family began Federal Aviation Regulations Part 33 (FAR33) certification and development flight testing on the A320neo aircraft, and successfully ran on 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The GTF Advantage configuration extends the economic and environmental benefits of today’s GTF engine, as it reduces fuel consumption by an additional 1 percent, extending the engine's lead as the most efficient powerplant for the A320neo family. The GTF family now powers more than 1,400 aircraft across 64 airlines and three aircraft platforms: Airbus A320neo family, Airbus A220 and Embraer E-Jets E2. The year also saw the entry into service of multiple new platforms, including the Cessna SkyCourier, Daher Kodiak 900 and TBM960, and ATR’s next generation 42 & 72 aircraft powered by the new PW127XT-M engines, with Transport Canada engine certifications of the PW127XT-M, PW812GA and PW812D engines to power the ATR 72-600 regional turboprop, Gulfstream G400 and Dassault Falcon 6X aircraft respectively. In addition, Pratt & Whitney received a significant number of contract awards for the F135 program, which powers all three variants of the F-35 Lightning II fighter aircraft including an undefinitized contract action for Lots 15-17 and funding to begin work on an F135 engine core upgrade. The F135 program also achieved several F135 production milestones, including the delivery of the 1,000th production engine, and Pratt & Whitney added new customers, Switzerland, Canada, and Germany to the program. Significant activity continued on development programs including the Adaptive Engine Testing Program, as well as the rollout ceremony for the Northrop Grumman B-21 Raider, powered by Pratt & Whitney engines.

Sales and Customers We have substantial U.S. government sales, which we conduct through all four of our business segments. RIS and RMD together represent a significant portion of those sales. In addition, as a global company, all four of our business segments have substantial international sales. 6 Table of Contents U.S. Government Sales. Our U.S. government sales were as follows: (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Sales to the U.S. government (1) $ 30,317 $ 31,177 $ 25,962 Sales to the U.S. government as a percentage of Total Net Sales (1) 45 % 48 % 46 % (1) Excludes foreign military sales through the U.S. government. See “Note 21: Segment Financial Data” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. International Sales. Our sales to international customers, based on customer end use location, were as follows: (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Total international sales (1) $ 25,884 $ 24,377 $ 22,027 Total international sales as a percentage of Total Net Sales (1) 39 % 38 % 39 % (1) Includes foreign military sales through the U.S. government. See “Note 21: Segment Financial Data” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. Backlog. Backlog, which is equivalent to our remaining performance obligations (RPO) for our sales contracts, represents the aggregate dollar value of firm orders for which products have not been provided or service has not been performed and excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering-type contracts (e.g., indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) type contracts). Total backlog was $175 billion and $156 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Of the total RPO as of December 31, 2022, we expect approximately 25% will be recognized as sales over the next 12 months. Competition All of our businesses are subject to significant competition. Our businesses compete on a variety of factors such as price, delivery schedule, past performance, reliability, customer service, product development, innovation and technology. Many of our competitors have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities. Further, some non-U.S. competitors receive government research and development assistance, marketing subsidies and other assistance for their products beyond the assistance that may be available to us as a U.S. company. In addition, the competitive landscape in the industry segments we serve continues to evolve with trends such as increased vertical integration by competitors and customers and the emergence of more commercial competitors on defense development programs. Our aerospace businesses compete with numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers, customers and companies that obtain regulatory agency approval to manufacture spare parts. Customer selections of aircraft engines, components and systems can also have a significant impact on future sales of parts and services. In addition, the U.S. government’s and other governments’ policies of purchasing parts from suppliers other than the original equipment manufacturer affect military spare parts sales. Some competitors may offer substantial discounts and other financial incentives, performance and operating cost guarantees, and participation in financing arrangements in an effort to compete for the aftermarket associated with these products. Our defense businesses compete with numerous U.S. and foreign companies in most defense and government electronics, space, information technology and technical services and support segments. We frequently partner on defense programs with our major suppliers, some of whom are, from time to time, competitors on other programs. People As a global technology and innovation-driven company, we depend on a highly skilled workforce. Attracting, developing, advancing and retaining the best talent is critical for us to execute our strategy and grow our business. Individuals with technical, engineering, and science backgrounds, experience, or interests are particularly important for us to succeed in the industries in which we compete. Due to macroeconomic, industry and labor market conditions, we have experienced and continue to experience a highly competitive environment with respect to hiring and retaining employees with relevant qualifications and experience, particularly personnel with specialized engineering experience and security clearances, which has negatively impacted our operating and financial performance. We continuously monitor labor market conditions and trends and are working to mitigate this issue through talent acquisition, partnership, sourcing and recruiting arrangements, workforce succession planning, talent identification, development and advancement, engagement and recognition programs, and initiatives to attract and rehire former 7 Table of Contents employees. However, we expect the current labor market conditions and highly competitive employee hiring and retention environment to continue. Governance. The Human Capital & Compensation Committee of the RTC Board of Directors oversees the Company’s human capital management. Workforce Demographics. As of December 31, 2022, our global employee population consisted of a total of approximately 182,000 employees, including approximately 55,000 engineering professionals and approximately 31,000 employees represented by labor unions and other employee representative bodies. Our employees are located in 52 countries, with 70% of our employees located in the U.S. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I). We strive to advance a diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment. We believe a work environment where all individuals are respected, valued and supported enables them to focus on developing the most innovative solutions to our industry’s greatest challenges. We have a DE&I advisory board of senior leaders. We review diversity in talent development and promotion, employee compensation practices and succession planning, and embed DE&I training into our leadership development programs. We have published our U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity EEO-1 report data as part of our Environmental Social Governance Report. We have nine diverse global employee resource groups, which are volunteer-run organizations that are open to all employees and are intended to foster an inclusive culture. We also invest in a more diverse workforce by supporting science, technology, engineering and mathematics initiatives for women and people of color, and providing opportunities and support to military veterans, people with disabilities and the LGBTQ+ community. As of December 31, 2022, women represented 25% of our global workforce and 33% of our global executives, and people of color represented 32% of our U.S. employee population and 17% of our U.S. executives. In addition, based on those employees who self-identified, veterans represented 12% of our U.S. employee population. Talent Acquisition, Development and Retention; Employee Health and Safety. We continuously monitor the hiring, retention and management of our employees by business and function with a focus to attract, develop, engage, advance and retain the best talent in the industry. We invest in our workforce through internal and external education, training and development programs and tuition assistance benefits. We also provide market competitive compensation and benefits. We recognize and reward performance during our annual review process. We regularly conduct succession planning to ensure that we continue to cultivate the leadership pipeline of talent needed to execute our business strategy. We solicit employee feedback on RTC’s performance as an employer via confidential surveys in the pre-hire, active and exit stages of employment, and use those results to improve our workplace and employee experience. These surveys cover various topics related to employee engagement and satisfaction. We have industry-leading health and safety programs to help maintain a safe work environment for all employees and mitigate workplace incidents, risks and hazards. We review and monitor our performance and encourage employee input to identify opportunities to reduce incidents. Moreover, we have industry-leading ethics and compliance programs to help mitigate associated employee risks. We also provide health and wellness benefits and support flexible work arrangements for our employees. Additional information regarding our human capital strategy is available in our “People” section of our Environmental Social Governance Report that can be found on our company website. Information on our website, including our Environmental Social Governance Report, is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K. For information on the risks related to our human capital resources, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K. Research and Development and Operations Our innovative products and services incorporate advanced technologies. As a result, we invest substantial amounts in research and development (R&D) activities using our own funds and under contractual arrangements with our customers, to enhance existing products and services and develop future technologies to meet our customers’ changing needs and requirements, as well as to address new business opportunities. We manufacture and service our products in over 229 manufacturing, production or overhaul facilities in approximately 30 countries, including the U.S. In addition, RTC has offices in approximately 10 other countries. Intellectual Property We maintain a portfolio of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, licenses and franchises related to our businesses. We rely on a combination of these rights, along with nondisclosure agreements, IT security systems, internal controls and compliance systems and other measures to protect our intellectual property. The U.S. government and foreign governments have licenses to certain of our intellectual property, including certain patents, which are developed or used in the performance of government contracts. Commercial customers also have licenses to certain of our intellectual property largely in connection 8 Table of Contents with the sale of our products. While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of each of our businesses, we do not believe that our business would be materially affected by the expiration of any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement. Suppliers and Raw Materials We are dependent upon the availability of materials and major components and the performance of our suppliers and subcontractors. Some of our products require relatively scarce raw materials. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers. In addition, in some cases, we must comply with specific procurement requirements, which may limit the suppliers and subcontractors we may utilize. Like other users in the U.S., we are largely dependent upon foreign sources for certain raw materials, such as cobalt, tantalum, chromium, rhenium, nickel and titanium. We also have some foreign suppliers as single-source suppliers of components. Global supply chain and labor markets are continuing to experience high levels of disruption, causing significant materials and parts shortages, including raw material, microelectronics and commodity shortages, as well as delivery delays, labor shortages, distribution issues, energy cost increases and price increases. We and many of our suppliers and subcontractors have ceased operations in Russia due to sanctions and have ceased sourcing of components that are subject to sanctions. Other suppliers and subcontractors are located in areas experiencing supply impediments or are at risk of being subjected to trade restrictive actions, due to current geopolitical conditions. In addition, some suppliers and subcontractors have been, or may in the future be, impacted by credit market conditions, including higher interest rates and the availability of credit. Our supplier and subcontractor performance continues to be affected by these issues, and we have experienced difficulties receiving necessary raw materials, components, other supplies and third-party services on a timely basis or at all. Our business has been negatively impacted by the above factors, as well as price increases arising from these issues and ongoing inflation. We work continuously to mitigate the effects of these supply chain issues through targeted activities as well as through our ongoing supply chain programs. We work with our suppliers and subcontractors to assess the causes of performance failures and delays. We are providing our suppliers with access to our contract labor networks to augment supplier workforces, providing suppliers with raw materials and technical support, and leveraging our raw materials contracts to apply our negotiated rates to purchases by our suppliers. We are also working to arrange second and third supply source alternatives and have increased our inventory of available materials and parts. We regularly pursue cost reductions through a number of mechanisms, including consolidating or re-sourcing our purchased parts, expanding use of long-term agreements, reducing the number of suppliers generally (except as described above for important supply alternatives), strategic sourcing in cost competitive regions, competitions among suppliers and other low-cost sourcing initiatives. We also have a number of ongoing programs to manage our dependence on foreign raw material supply and the accompanying risk, including long-term agreements and the conservation of materials through scrap reclamation and new manufacturing processes. In addition, to help address the risk of supplier closings or bankruptcies, we monitor the liquidity of our significant supplier base. For additional information related to supply chain issues, see Item IA. “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K. Other Matters Relating to Our Business As worldwide businesses, our operations can be affected by a variety of economic, industry and other factors, including those described in this section, in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” in Item 1. “Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results,” and in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to negatively affect the global economy, our business and operations, the labor market, supply chains, inflation, and the industries in which we operate. Commercial air travel has been significantly disrupted by the pandemic and government, business and individual actions in response. Commercial air travel has not fully returned to pre-COVID-19 levels, although we continue to see signs of ongoing recovery. While we believe that the long-term outlook for the aerospace industry remains positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel demand, there continues to be uncertainty with respect to when commercial air traffic capacity will fully return to and/or exceed pre-COVID-19 levels. For additional information related to the COVID-19 pandemic, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K. Regulatory Matters Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation in the industries we serve. We deal with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, including but not limited to all of the branches of the DoD, the FAA, and the Department of Homeland Security. Similar government authorities exist in all of the countries in which we do business. U.S. Government Contracts. As previously discussed, the U.S. government is our largest customer, representing a substantial majority of our total defense sales. U.S. government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for convenience or for default in the event of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. In the case of a termination for 9 Table of Contents convenience, we would normally be entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred, termination costs and a reasonable profit. If terminated by the government as a result of our default, we could be liable for payments made to us for undelivered goods or services, additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers. Our U.S. government contracts generally are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which sets forth policies, procedures and requirements for the acquisition of goods and services by the U.S. government; department-specific regulations that implement or supplement the FAR, such as the DoD’s Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS); and other applicable laws and regulations. These regulations impose a broad range of requirements, many of which are unique to government contracting, including various procurement, import and export, security, contract pricing and cost, contract termination and adjustment, audit and product integrity requirements. A contractor’s failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could result in reductions to the value of contracts, contract modifications or termination, cash withholds on contract payments, forfeiture of profits, and/or the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and fines, and could lead to suspension or debarment, for cause, from U.S. government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time. For further discussion of risks related to government contracting, including on-going litigation associated with U.S. government audits and investigations, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors” and Item 3. “Legal Proceedings” of this Form 10-K and “Note 18: Commitments and Contingencies” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Commercial Aerospace Product Regulation. Our commercial aerospace products are subject to regulations by the FAA, foreign aviation administration authorities and international regulatory bodies, including on production and quality systems, airworthiness and installation approvals, repair procedures and continuing operational safety. In addition, commercial aerospace regulations and regulator approaches differ across jurisdictions and changes in such regulations and implementing legislation can impact our operations. Environmental Regulation. Our operations are subject to and affected by environmental regulation by federal, state and local authorities in the U.S. and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our international operations, including with respect to the generation, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We use hazardous substances and generate hazardous wastes in some of our operations and have incurred, and will likely continue to incur, costs associated with environmental compliance activities and management of remediation matters at sites with pollutants. A portion of these costs are eligible for future recovery through the pricing of our products and services under our contracts with the U.S. government. In addition, we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act, also known as the Superfund law, or state law counterparts to the Superfund law, for a number of sites. The nature and extent of environmental concerns vary from site to site and our share of responsibility varies from sole responsibility to very little responsibility. We also manage various government-owned facilities on behalf of the U.S. government. At such facilities, environmental compliance and remediation costs have historically been primarily the responsibility of the U.S. government, and we have relied upon the U.S. government funding to pay such costs. We do not anticipate that compliance with current provisions or requirements relating to the protection of the environment or that any payments we may be required to make for cleanup liabilities will have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Environmental matters are further addressed in “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” and “Note 18: Commitments and Contingencies” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Most of the U.S. laws governing environmental matters include criminal provisions. If we were convicted of a violation of the federal Clean Air Act or Clean Water Act, the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be deemed ineligible to be used in performing any U.S. government contract we are awarded until the Environmental Protection Agency thereafter certifies that the condition giving rise to the violation has been corrected. In addition, we could be affected by future foreign or domestic laws or regulations imposed in response to concerns over climate change, and we monitor developments in environmental and climate-related laws and regulations and their potential impact to our business and financial condition. Changes in environmental and climate-related laws or regulations, including regulations on greenhouse gas emissions, carbon pricing, energy taxes, product efficiency standards, and mandatory disclosure obligations could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and facility upgrades and could increase our operational and environmental compliance expenditures, including increased energy and raw materials costs and costs associated with manufacturing changes. For further discussion of risks related to environmental and climate matters and other government regulations, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K. Other Applicable Regulations. We conduct our businesses through subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide. As a result, our businesses and operations are subject to both U.S. and non-U.S. government laws, regulations and procurement policies and 10 Table of Contents practices, including regulations relating to import-export controls, tariffs, taxes, investment, sanctions, exchange controls, anti-corruption, and cash repatriation. Our international sales are also subject to varying currency, political and economic risks.

Additional information as to factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements is disclosed from time to time in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) . 12 Table of Contents ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Our business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity can be impacted by the factors set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. INDUSTRY RISKS Our business may be adversely affected by changes in global economic, capital market and political conditions. Our business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions, international relations and geopolitical events and actions, including inflation, credit market conditions, levels of consumer and business confidence, commodity (including energy) prices and supply, trade policies, exchange rates, changing policy positions or priorities, levels of government spending and deficits, the threat environment, political conditions, and actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt. The current global supply chain and labor market challenges and inflationary pressures have negatively affected, and we expect will continue to negatively affect, our performance as well as the performance of our suppliers and subcontractors. In addition, due to the nature of our government and commercial aerospace businesses, and their respective customer and supplier contracts, we may be unable to increase our contract value or pricing to offset cost increases, in particular on our fixed price contracts. Our operating profits and margins under our contracts could be adversely affected by these factors. Similarly, interest rate increases have created financial market volatility and could further negatively impact financial markets, lead to an economic downturn or recession, and tighten the availability of, and increase the cost of capital for, the Company, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity. Tightening of credit in financial markets also could adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations, could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services, could impact the ability of our customers to make payments, and could increase the risk of supplier financial distress. Our global business is also adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity, such as decreases in business and consumer spending, air travel, the financial strength of airlines and business jet operators, and government procurement. In addition, geopolitical risks could affect government priorities, budgets and policies, such as U.S. approvals of our foreign defense sales as well as sanctions and other trade-restrictive activities, which could impact sales of defense and other products and services. Changes in U.S. government defense spending could negatively impact our financial position, results of operations, liquidity and overall business. U.S. government sales constitute a significant portion of our consolidated sales. Our U.S. government revenues largely result from contracts awarded under various U.S. government programs, primarily defense-related programs with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), and a broad range of programs with the U.S. Intelligence Community and other departments and agencies. Changes in U.S. government defense spending for various reasons, including as a result of potential changes in policy or budgetary positions or priorities, could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our programs are subject to U.S. government policies, budget decisions and appropriation processes which are driven by numerous factors including U.S. domestic and broader geopolitical events, macroeconomic conditions, and the ability of the U.S. government to enact relevant legislation, such as appropriations bills. In recent years, U.S. government appropriations have been affected by larger U.S. government budgetary issues and related legislation, and the U.S. government has been unable to complete its budget process before the end of its fiscal year, resulting in both governmental shutdowns and continuing resolutions (CRs) providing only enough funds for U.S. government agencies to continue operating at prior-year levels. Further, if the U.S. government debt ceiling is not raised and the national debt reaches the statutory debt ceiling, the U.S. government could default on its debts. As a result, U.S. government defense spending levels are subject to a wide range of outcomes and are difficult to predict beyond the near-term due to numerous factors, including the external threat environment, future governmental priorities and the state of governmental finances. Significant changes in U.S. government defense spending or changes in U.S. government priorities, policies and requirements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We face risks relating to our U.S. government contracts and the mix of our U.S. government contracts and programs. The termination of one or more of our U.S. government contracts, or the occurrence of performance delays, cost overruns (due to inflation or otherwise), product failures, shortages in materials, components or labor, or contract definitization delays, could negatively impact our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. U.S. government contracts generally permit the government to terminate the contract, in whole or in part, without prior notice, at the U.S. government’s convenience or for default based on performance. If one of our contracts is terminated for convenience, we would generally be entitled to payments for our allowable costs and would receive some allowance for profit on the work performed. If one of our contracts is terminated for default, we would generally be entitled to payments for work accepted by the U.S. government. A termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future contracts and orders. In addition, we are a subcontractor on some contracts, and the U.S. government could terminate the prime contract for convenience or otherwise, without regard to our performance as a subcontractor. We may not be able to offset lost revenues resulting from contract termination. Moreover, because the funding of U.S. government programs is subject to 13 Table of Contents congressional appropriations made on a fiscal year basis even for multi-year programs, programs are often only partially funded initially and may not continue to be funded in future years. Appropriation bills may be delayed, which may result in delays to funding, the collection of receivables and our contract performance due to lack of authorized funds to procure related products and services. The timing of contract definitization can be affected by factors specific to the U.S. government, including staffing limitations. Under certain circumstances, we may use our own funds to meet our customer’s desired delivery dates or other requirements, but we may not be reimbursed. Further, if appropriations for one of our programs become unavailable, reduced or delayed, the U.S. government may terminate for convenience our contract or subcontract under that program. In addition, our U.S. government contracts typically involve the development, application and manufacture of advanced defense and technology systems and products aimed at achieving challenging goals. As a result of untested or unproven technologies, or modified requirements or specifications, we may experience technological and other performance difficulties (including delays, setbacks, cost overruns, or product failures), our attention or resources may be diverted from other projects and our future sales opportunities may be impacted. Additionally, as our customers demand more mature and proven solutions, we may be required to invest in development prior to contract award with no guarantee of award. Our U.S. government contracts are typically either fixed-priced contracts or cost reimbursement contracts. Fixed-price contracts are predominantly either firm fixed-price (FFP) contracts or fixed-price incentive (FPI) contracts. Under FFP contracts, we receive a fixed price irrespective of the actual costs we incur, and we therefore carry the burden of any cost overruns. Under FPI contracts, we generally share with the U.S. government savings for cost underruns less than target costs and expenses for cost overruns exceeding target costs up to a negotiated ceiling price. We carry the entire burden of cost overruns exceeding the ceiling price amount under FPI contracts. Under cost reimbursable contracts, we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fixed or performance-based fee, but we are generally not reimbursed for unauthorized costs exceeding a cost ceiling amount or costs not allowable under the contract or applicable regulations. If we are unable to control costs or if our initial cost estimates are incorrect, our profitability could be negatively affected, particularly under fixed-price development contracts. We may also experience cost underruns which would reduce contract value and related expected revenues, and we may be unable to expand the contract scope or secure additional work to offset the resulting lost revenues. While contracts for development programs with complex design and technical challenges are typically cost reimbursable, they can be FFP or FPI, which can significantly increase our risk of a potential negative profit adjustment, as development contracts by nature involve elements that have not been undertaken before and, thus, are highly subject to future unexpected cost growth. In addition, other contracts in backlog are for the transition from development to production, which includes starting and stabilizing a manufacturing and test line while the final design is still being validated. Moreover, over the past several years, the DoD has increased its use of Other Transaction Authority (OTA) contracts, under which it awards certain prototypes, research and production contracts without all of the procurement requirements that typically apply to DoD contracts, including justification of sole source awards. OTAs may use fixed-price contracting during all phases of the contract, or mandated contract cost sharing (e.g., one-third of program costs). They may also require non-traditional subcontractor participation and impose other requirements that differ from our other DoD contracts. Our business may be negatively impacted if we are unable to perform on our OTA contracts, including any applicable non-traditional requirements. In addition, in order to support U.S. government priorities, we may begin performance prior to completing contract negotiations for an undefinitized contract action with a not-to-exceed price. Uncertainties in final contract price, specifications and terms, or loss of negotiating leverage associated with particularly long delays in contract definitization may negatively affect our profitability. Our U.S. government contracts also require us to comply with extensive and evolving procurement rules and regulations and subject us to potential U.S. government audits, investigations, and disputes. We are also involved in programs that are classified by the U.S. government, which have security requirements that place limits on our ability to discuss our performance on these programs, including any risks, disputes and claims. Our international business is subject to economic, regulatory, competition and other risks. Our international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with political and economic factors, regulatory requirements, competition and other risks. A significant portion of our sales are international, including U.S. export sales. Our non-U.S. operations transactions may be denominated in local currencies. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations (including their impact on supplier prices) may negatively affect demand for our products and our reported profits, as well as our operating margins. The majority of our commercial aerospace sales are in U.S. Dollars, while the majority of their non-U.S. costs are incurred in the applicable local currency. Pratt & Whitney Canada is especially susceptible to fluctuations in exchange rates for this reason. In addition, because our financial statements are denominated in U.S. Dollars, currency fluctuations may cause translation gains or losses for non-U.S. operating unit financial statements. Our international sales and operations are also subject to risks associated with local government laws, regulations and policies, including with respect to investments, taxation, exchange controls, capital controls, employment regulations and repatriation of earnings. Differing legal systems, customs and contract laws and regulations pose additional risk. International transactions may include contractual terms that differ from those of similar contracts in the U.S. or that may be interpreted differently in foreign countries. In addition, in certain foreign countries, we engage foreign non-employee representatives and consultants for 14 Table of Contents international sales and teaming with international subcontractors, partners and suppliers for international programs. While we have robust policies and controls in place, these engagements expose us to various challenges including risks associated with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and local antibribery laws and regulations. From time to time, we have disputes with such representatives regarding claimed commissions and other matters which can result in litigation or arbitration. In addition, we face risks related to the unintended or unauthorized use of our products. Our international business faces substantial competition from both U.S. companies and foreign companies. In some instances, foreign companies may be owned by foreign governments or may receive loans, marketing subsidies and other assistance from their governments that may not be available to U.S. companies or our foreign subsidiaries. In addition, foreign companies may be subject to fewer restrictions on technology transfer than U.S. companies. Our international contracts, particularly for sales of defense products and services, may include offset or industrial cooperation obligations requiring specific local purchases, manufacturing agreements, technology transfer agreements or financial support obligations, sometimes in the form of in-country industrial participation (ICIP) agreements. Approvals of offset or ICIP thresholds and requirements may be subjective and time-consuming and may delay contract awards. Certain customers’ demands are increasing for greater offset or ICIP commitment levels, higher-value content, including the transfer of technologies and capabilities, and local production and economic development. As a result of the above factors, we could experience financial penalties and award and funding delays on international programs, our profitability on these programs could be negatively affected, and we could incur losses on these programs that could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Geopolitical factors and changes in policies and regulations could adversely affect our business. Our international sales and operations are sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities, foreign government budgets, and regional and local political and economic factors, including volatility in energy prices or supply, political or civil unrest, changes in threat environments and political relations, geopolitical uncertainties, and changes in U.S. foreign policy. Our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in foreign government laws, regulations and policies, including those related to tariffs, sanctions, embargoes, export and import controls and other trade restrictions. Events such as increased trade restrictions or retaliatory trade policies, renegotiation of existing trade agreements, or regime change can affect demand for our products and services, the competitive position of our products, our supply chain, and our ability to manufacture or sell products in certain countries. Further, operations in emerging market countries are subject to additional risks, including volatility in gross domestic product and rates of economic growth, government instability, cultural differences (such as employment and business practices), the imposition of exchange and capital controls, and risks associated with exporting components manufactured in those countries for incorporation into finished products completed in other countries. While these factors and their impact are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. In addition, given the role of our defense businesses in the support of the national security interests of the U. S. and its allies, we are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to policies of the U.S. and its allies, as well as other countries, including those that are or become regarded as potential adversaries or threats. We engage in both direct commercial sales, which generally require U.S. government licenses and approvals, as well as foreign military sales, which are government-to-government transactions initiated by, and carried out at the direction of, the U.S. government. Changes in budgets and spending levels, policies, or priorities, which are subject to geopolitical risks and threats, may impact our defense businesses, including the timing of and delays in U.S. government licenses and approvals for sales, the risk of sanctions or other restrictions, as well as potential human rights issues associated with the use of our defense products. These risks and uncertainties may directly or indirectly impact our commercial businesses as well. Of note, China previously announced it may take measures against Raytheon Technologies Corporation (RTC) in connection with certain foreign military sales to Taiwan involving RTC products and services. In addition, China has indicated that it decided to sanction our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Gregory Hayes, in connection with another potential foreign military sale to Taiwan involving RTC products and services. RTC is not aware of any specific sanctions against Mr. Hayes or RTC, or the nature or timing of any future potential sanctions or countermeasures. If China were to impose sanctions or take other regulatory action against RTC, our suppliers, affiliates or partners, it could potentially disrupt our business operations. The impact of potential sanctions or other actions by China cannot be determined at this time. From time to time, our businesses have sold, and are expected to sell in the future, additional defense products to Taiwan, and we are unable to determine the potential impact, if any, of any future sanctions or other actions by China in response to these sales. Moreover, the Chinese government has generally expanded its ability to restrict China-related import, export and investment activities, which may have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct business or sell our commercial aerospace products in China. In addition, in response to the Russian military’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, the U.S. government and the governments of various jurisdictions in which we operate, including Canada, the United Kingdom, the European Union, and others, have 15 Table of Contents imposed broad economic sanctions and export controls targeting specific industries, entities and individuals in Russia. The Russian government has implemented similar counter-sanctions and export controls targeting specific industries, entities and individuals in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate, including certain members of the Company’s management team and Board of Directors. These government measures, among other limitations, restrict transactions involving various Russian banks and financial institutions and impose enhanced export controls limiting transfers of various goods, software and technologies to and from Russia, including broadened export controls specifically targeting the aerospace sector. These measures have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect the Company and/or our supply chain, business partners or customers. Our financial performance is dependent on the condition of the aerospace industry. Our aerospace businesses constitute a substantial portion of our financial results, and the performance of those businesses is directly tied to economic conditions in the commercial aerospace industry, which is cyclical in nature. Capital spending and demand for aircraft engines, aerospace products and component aftermarket parts and services by commercial airlines, lessors, other aircraft operators and aircraft manufacturers are influenced by a wide variety of factors, including current and predicted traffic levels, load factors, aircraft fuel prices, labor issues, airline consolidation, bankruptcies and restructuring activities, competition, the retirement of older aircraft, regulatory changes, terrorism and related safety concerns, general economic conditions, tightening of credit in financial markets, corporate profitability, cost reduction efforts and remaining performance obligations levels. Any of these factors could reduce the sales and margins of our aerospace businesses. Other factors, including future terrorist actions, aviation safety concerns, pandemic health issues or major natural disasters, could also dramatically reduce the demand for commercial air travel, which could negatively impact the sales and margins of our aerospace businesses. Additionally, because a substantial portion of product deliveries to commercial aerospace customers are scheduled for delivery in the future, changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled. At times, our aerospace businesses also enter into firm fixed-price or cost-share development contracts with customers, which may require us to bear cost overruns related to unforeseen technical and design challenges that arise during the development and early production stages of the program. Spare parts sales and aftermarket service trends are affected by similar factors, including usage, pricing, technological improvements, regulatory changes and the retirement of older aircraft. Furthermore, because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing products in these business segments to market, we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is ready to enter into service. A reduction in spending in the commercial aviation industry could have a significant effect on the demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. We design, manufacture and service products that incorporate advanced technologies; the introduction of new products and technologies involves risks, and we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated. The design, development, production, sale and support of innovative commercial aerospace and defense systems and products involves advanced technologies. We invest substantial amounts in research and development efforts to pursue advancements in a wide range of technologies, products and services aimed at meeting the ever-evolving product, program and service needs of our customers. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our investments depends on a variety of factors, including meeting development, production, certification and regulatory approval schedules; receiving regulatory approvals; execution of internal and external performance plans; achieving cost and production efficiencies; availability and quality of supplier- and internally-produced parts and materials; availability of supplier and internal facility capacity to perform maintenance, repair and overhaul services; availability of test equipment; development of complex software; hiring and training of qualified personnel; identification of emerging technological trends for our target end-customers; the level of customer interest in new technologies and products and customer acceptance of our products and technologies. For example, our customers manufacture or acquire end products and systems that incorporate certain of our products. These end products and systems may also incorporate additional technologies manufactured by third parties and involve additional risks and uncertainties. As a result, the performance and industry acceptance of these larger systems and end products could affect the level of customer interest in and acceptance of our products in the marketplace. In addition, many of our products must adhere to strict regulatory and market-driven safety and performance standards in a variety of jurisdictions. The evolving nature of these standards, along with the long duration of development, production and aftermarket support programs, creates uncertainty regarding program profitability, particularly with our aircraft engine products. Development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses, and these efforts may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings. In addition, the industries for our products or products that incorporate our technologies may not develop or grow as we anticipate. We or our customers, suppliers or subcontractors may encounter difficulties in developing and producing new products and services, and may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated or may otherwise suffer significant adverse financial consequences. Due to the design complexity of our products or those of our customers or third party manufacturers that incorporate our products into theirs or our customers’ products, we may experience delays in completing the development and introduction of new products or we may experience the suspension of production after these products enter into service due to safety concerns. Delays and/or 16 Table of Contents suspension of production could result in increased development costs or deflect resources from other projects. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. In particular, Pratt & Whitney is currently producing and delivering the Geared Turbofan engine to power various aircraft. The level of orders received for the Geared Turbofan family of engines, coupled with a requirement to achieve mature production levels in a very short time frame, require significant additional manufacturing and supply chain capacity. If any of our production ramp-up efforts are delayed, if suppliers cannot timely deliver or perform to our standards, and/or if we identify or experience issues with in-service engines, we may not meet customers’ delivery schedules, which could result in material additional costs, including liquidated damages or other liabilities that could be assessed under existing contracts. Competition may reduce our revenues and limit our future opportunities. We operate in highly competitive industries and our competitors may have more extensive or more specialized engineering, manufacturing, marketing and servicing capabilities than we do. Our contracts are typically awarded on a competitive basis. Our bids are based in part upon the cost to provide the products and services. If we fail to accurately estimate these costs, the profitability of our contracts may be adversely affected. In addition, we may face customer-directed cost reduction targets that could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our contracts if these targets are not achieved when required. We have also experienced highly competitive pricing, in which a bidder may anticipate making a substantial investment in a program in order to win the work. Moreover, bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards are frequent with respect to DoD awards in particular. Generally, a bid protest will delay the start of contract activities, delay earnings, and could result in the award decision being overturned and require a re-bid of the contract. Highly competitive activity within the commercial aerospace industry has included substantial discounts and other financial incentives, performance and operating cost guarantees, and participation in financing arrangements, in order to secure both new engine business and the aftermarket revenues associated with these products. Further, our competitors, including our customers, may develop competing technologies which gain industry acceptance in advance of or instead of our products, or meet particular in-demand technological needs before us or with technology that is superior to our existing or new technologies. In addition, our competitors or customers might develop new technologies or offerings that might cause our existing technologies and offerings to become obsolete or otherwise decrease demand for our offerings. In addition, the possibility exists that competitors or customers will develop aftermarket services and parts for our products that attract customers and adversely impact our return on investment on new products. We also anticipate companies continuing to enhance their competitive position against our defense businesses as a result of continued domestic and cross-border defense industry consolidation and the expansion of competitors’ capabilities throughout the supply chain through vertical integration. We are also facing heightened competition domestically and internationally from foreign and multinational firms. Additionally, some customers, including the DoD, are increasingly turning to commercial contractors, rather than traditional defense contractors, for space-related technologies and for information technology and other support work. If we are unable to continue to compete successfully against our current or future competitors in our core businesses, we may experience declines in revenues and industry segment share which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. The Coronavirus Disease 2019 ( COVID-19) pandemic has affected our business, and we continue to face risks associated with it. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to negatively affect the global economy, our business and operations, and the industries in which we operate. The pandemic and government, business and individual actions in response, including lockdowns, quarantines, border closings and other travel restrictions and requirements, remote working, facilities closures and reduced business and leisure travel, led to significant declines in demand for commercial air travel in 2020 and 2021 and, therefore, for our commercial aerospace products and services. While we have seen signs of ongoing recovery in the overall demand for commercial air travel and currently expect that recovery to continue, some commercial aviation segments have recovered less quickly than others, and it remains uncertain when commercial air traffic will fully return to and/or exceed pre-pandemic levels. The resulting financial impact is highly uncertain and subject to a wide range of factors and future developments. In addition, a resurgence of the pandemic (including COVID-19 variants), regional lockdowns or other negative developments associated with the pandemic could hinder or reverse the commercial air traffic recovery. Negative developments concerning the effect of the pandemic or additional variants, the efficacy and acceptance of vaccines, new or continued actions to contain the pandemic’s spread or treat its impact, and governmental, business and individual actions taken in response to the pandemic (lockdowns, quarantines, border closings and other travel restrictions and requirements, remote working, facilities closures, and reduced business and leisure travel patterns and work environments) could create significant business disruption for us and our suppliers, subcontractors and customers, exacerbate existing supply chain and labor shortages, redirect government funds and decrease defense budgets, and negatively affect global economic conditions. These factors could hinder or delay our production capabilities, impede our ability to perform on our obligations to our customers, result in increased costs to us and decreased demand for our products and services, and could negatively affect our performance on our customer 17 Table of Contents contracts and our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The ultimate duration and financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic remains unknown at this time. OPERATIONAL RISKS We depend on the availability of materials and performance of our suppliers, and the impacts of global supply chain and labor market disruptions on our supply chain have negatively affected and will continue to negatively affect our business. Our performance requires a variety of raw materials, supplier-provided parts, components, sub-systems and contract manufacturing services, and we rely on U.S. and non-U.S. suppliers (including third-party manufacturing suppliers, subcontractors and service providers) and commodity markets for these materials and services. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply, manufacturing, services support or assembly, or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers. In addition, our defense businesses are subject to specific procurement requirements that limit the types of materials they use. Our defense businesses also must require suppliers to comply with various DoD requirements, including cybersecurity requirements, any of which requirements may further limit the suppliers and subcontractors they may utilize. Identifying and qualifying second- or third- source suppliers can be difficult, time-consuming and may result in increased costs. In addition, global supply chain and labor markets are continuing to experience high levels of disruption, causing significant materials and parts shortages, as well as delivery delays, labor shortages, distribution issues, energy cost increases and price increases. Current geopolitical conditions, including sanctions and other trade restrictive activities and strained intercountry relations, are contributing to these issues. Certain of our suppliers and subcontractors have been unable to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel for their performance. We and our suppliers and subcontractors have also experienced difficulties in procuring necessary raw materials and components, including microelectronics. All of the above have contributed to price increases. These issues have led to significant supplier and subcontractor performance failures and delays. As a result of these various problems, we have had difficulties receiving necessary materials, components, other supplies and third-party services timely or at all, which have negatively impacted production flow in our factories, hindered our ability to perform on our commitments to customers and negatively affected our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our supply costs have increased due to the above factors. Continuing high inflation has exacerbated these increases and increased our operating costs. In addition, we are largely dependent upon foreign sources for certain raw materials, such as cobalt, tantalum, chromium, rhenium, nickel and titanium. Moreover, some of our single-source components are sourced from foreign countries. Some raw materials and components have been in the past sourced from areas now under sanctions, such as Russia, or are currently sourced from areas which are at risk of sanctions or other trade restrictive actions, such as China. We work continuously to mitigate the effects of these supply chain issues and risks, including providing raw materials and technical support to our suppliers and subcontractors, as well as providing them with access to our contract labor networks to augment supplier and subcontractor workforces; seeking alternate supply sources; increasing our inventory of available materials and parts; pursuing various cost reductions such as long-term agreements; and leveraging our raw materials supply contracts to apply our negotiated rates to our suppliers’ purchases. The timing of the impacts of these supply chain risks and issues and our ability to mitigate them are uncertain and difficult to predict. However, we expect the current supply chain, labor availability and price issues, and their negative impacts on our business, to continue. In particular, we expect to experience prolonged delays for certain critical component parts and sub-systems. Furthermore, the existing supply chain and labor market issues could be compounded by other events, such as an economic downturn; supplier capacity constraints for other reasons; supplier quality issues (for example, defects or fraudulent parts); supplier closing, bankruptcy or financial difficulties; price increases for various reasons; worsening shortages of raw materials or commodities; and energy supply constraints, including as a result of war or other geopolitical actions, natural disaster (including the effects of climate change), health pandemic or other business continuity events, or transport and distribution issues, any of which could further negatively impact our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs and therefore incrementally affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Due to the nature of our products and services, a product safety failure or other failure affecting our or our customers’ or suppliers’ products or systems could seriously harm our business. Our products and services are highly sophisticated and specialized, involve complex advanced technologies, are often integrated with third-party products and services and are utilized for specific purposes that require precision, reliability and durability. Many of our products and services include both hardware and software that involve industrial machinery and intricate aviation and defense systems, including commercial and military jet engines, power and control systems and other aircraft parts, air and missile defense systems, and military sensors and command and control systems. Technical, mechanical and other failures may occur from time to time, whether as a result of manufacturing or design defect, operational process or production issue attributable to us, our customers, suppliers, third party integrators or others. In addition, our products could fail as a result of cyber-attacks, such as those that seize control and result in misuse or unintended use of our products, or other intentional acts. The impact of a catastrophic product or system failure or similar event affecting our or our customers’ or suppliers’ products or services could be significant, and could result in injuries 18 Table of Contents or death, property damage, loss of strategic capabilities, loss of intellectual property, loss of reputation, and other significant negative effects. A product or system failure could lead to negative publicity, a diversion of management attention and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services. It could also result in product recalls and product liability and warranty claims (including claims related to the safety or reliability of our products) and related expenses, other service, repair and maintenance costs, significant damages and other costs, including fines and other remedies and regulatory and environmental liabilities. We may also incur increased costs, delayed payments, reputational harm or lost equipment or services revenue in connection with a significant issue with a third party’s product with which our products are integrated. Further, our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all related costs and we may not otherwise be fully indemnified for them. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. We depend on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel, and our failure to attract, train and retain such personnel could seriously harm our business. Due to the specialized nature of our business, our future performance is highly dependent upon the continued services of our key technical personnel and executive officers, and the hiring, development and retention of qualified technical, engineering, manufacturing, marketing, sales and management personnel for our operations. Our defense business in particular requires qualified personnel with security clearances due to our classified programs. In addition, we experienced personnel reductions when the COVID-19 pandemic caused significant declines in demand for our commercial aerospace products and services, but current demand for our products and services across our businesses has created a significant need for us to hire additional and replacement personnel. Moreover, a significant percentage of our current workforce is nearing or eligible for retirement. To the extent that we lose experienced personnel in the future, it is critical that we develop other employees, hire new qualified personnel and successfully manage the transfer of knowledge. Current macroeconomic, industry and labor market conditions have exacerbated an already highly competitive market for hiring and retaining employees with relevant qualifications and experience. There is an ongoing labor shortage, particularly for highly qualified personnel including engineers, skilled laborers and security clearance holders. Labor market trends also include high attrition and wage inflation, and some candidates and new personnel may have different expectations from our current workforce. As a result of the above factors, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, significant difficulties in hiring and retaining personnel with relevant qualifications and experience, which has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, certain existing personnel may be required to receive various security clearances and substantial training in order to work on certain programs or perform certain tasks. Necessary security clearances may be delayed, which may impact our ability to perform on our U.S. government contracts. We also may not be successful in training or developing qualified personnel with the requisite relevant skills or security clearances. Loss of key employees, increased attrition for various reasons, failure to adequately train newly hired employees, delays in receiving required security clearances, or delays in hiring key personnel could also seriously harm our business. Moreover, we believe that a critical element of our ability to successfully attract, train and retain qualified personnel is our corporate culture, which we believe fosters innovation, collaboration, diversity and inclusion, and a focus on execution, all in an environment of high ethical standards. Our global operations may present challenges in maintaining these important aspects of our corporate culture, and a failure to maintain our corporate culture could negatively impact us. Further, we rely on our key personnel to lead with integrity and to meet our high ethical standards that promote excellent performance and cultivate diversity, equity and inclusion. To the extent any of our key personnel were to behave in a way that is inconsistent with our values, including with respect to product safety or quality, legal or regulatory compliance, financial reporting or people management, we could experience a materially adverse impact to our reputation and our operating results. In addition, failure or perceived failure to meet increasing stakeholder expectations on environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters could harm our reputation and impact demand for our products and services. Our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by cyber-attacks on information technology infrastructure and products. Our business may be impacted by disruptions to our own or third-party information technology (IT) infrastructure, which could result from, among other causes, cyber-attacks on or failures of such infrastructure or compromises to its physical security. We also encounter attempts to infiltrate our products and services and sabotage or disable their use by our customers. Cybersecurity threats are evolving and include, but are not limited to, both attacks on our IT infrastructure and attacks on the IT infrastructure of our customers, suppliers, subcontractors and other third parties with whom we do business routinely, both on premises and in the cloud, attempting to gain unauthorized access to our confidential or other proprietary information, classified information, or information relating to our employees, customers and other third parties, or to disrupt our systems or the systems of third parties. Cybersecurity threats also include attacks targeting the security, integrity and/or availability of the hardware, software and information installed, stored or transmitted in our products, including after the purchase of those products and when they are incorporated into third-party products, facilities or infrastructure. We are also exposed to the risk of insider threat attacks. Any such attacks could disrupt our systems or those of third parties (including 19 Table of Contents mission critical systems), impact business operations, result in unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, and corrupt our data or that of third parties. We have experienced cyber-based attacks, and due to the evolving threat landscape, may continue to experience them going forward, potentially with more frequency. The threats we face are continuous and evolving, and vary from attacks common to most industries to more advanced and persistent, highly organized adversaries, including nation states, which target us and other defense contractors. We continue to make investments and adopt measures designed to enhance our protection, detection, response, and recovery capabilities, and to mitigate potential risks to our technology, products, services and operations from potential cybersecurity threats. However, given the unpredictability, nature and scope of cyber-attacks, it is possible that we are unable to defend against all cyber attacks, that potential vulnerabilities could go undetected and persist in the environment for an extended period, or that we may otherwise be unable to mitigate customer losses and other potential consequences of these attacks. In addition, some products and services that we provide to customers, particularly those related to public security, may raise potential liabilities related to privacy and intellectual property. In some cases we must rely on the safeguards put in place by our customers, suppliers, subcontractors and other third parties to protect against and report cyber threats. We could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromise of confidential information, intellectual property or otherwise protected information, misappropriation, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our or third-party systems, networks or products, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business, or potential liability, penalties, fines and/or damage to our reputation. Any of these could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Some of these risks may be heightened due to the Company and its suppliers and other third parties operating with a significant number of employees working remotely. Due to the evolving nature of such risks, the impact of any potential incident cannot be predicted. Further, our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all related costs and we may not otherwise be fully indemnified for them. Exports and imports of certain of our products are subject to various export control, sanctions and import regulations and may require authorization from regulatory agencies of the U.S. or other countries. We must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the export and import of products, services and technology from and into the U.S. and other countries having jurisdiction over our operations. In the U.S., these laws and regulations include, among others, the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) administered by the U.S. Department of State, embargoes and sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and import regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Department of Justice. Certain of our products, services and technologies have military or strategic applications and are on the U.S. Munitions List of the ITAR, the Commerce Control List of the EAR or are otherwise subject to the EAR, and/or the U.S. Munitions Import List and we are required to obtain licenses and authorizations from the appropriate U.S. government agencies before selling these products outside of the U.S. or importing these products into the U.S. U.S. foreign policy or foreign policy of other licensing jurisdictions may affect the licensing process or otherwise prevent us from engaging in business dealings with certain individuals, entities or countries. Any failure by us, our customers or our suppliers to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal penalties, fines, seizure of our products, adverse publicity, restrictions on our ability to export or import our products, or the suspension or debarment from doing business with the U.S. government. Moreover, any changes in export control, sanctions or import regulations may further restrict the export or import of our products or services, and the possibility of such changes requires constant monitoring to ensure we remain compliant. Our ability to obtain required licenses and authorizations on a timely basis or at all is subject to risks and uncertainties, including changing U.S. government laws, regulations or foreign policies, delays in Congressional action, or geopolitical and other factors. If we are not successful in obtaining or maintaining the necessary licenses or authorizations in a timely manner, our sales relating to those approvals may be prevented or delayed, and revenue and profit previously recognized may be reversed. Any restrictions on the export or import of our products or product lines could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by threats to our physical security and other events outside our control. We could encounter threats to our physical security, including our facilities and personnel, and threats from, workplace violence, civil unrest, terrorism or similar acts, any of which could disrupt our business. In addition, our business, and the businesses of our suppliers, subcontractors and service providers and customers, could be disrupted by public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic), damaging weather or other acts of nature, cyber-attacks on IT infrastructure and products or other events outside of our control. Any such business disruption could subject us to production downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, financial losses from remedial actions, the diversion of management’s attention and resources, or loss of business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. The impact of any such business disruption is difficult to predict. 20 Table of Contents We depend on our intellectual property and have access to certain third party intellectual property; infringement or failure to protect our intellectual property or access to third party intellectual property could adversely affect our future growth and success. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements, IT security systems, internal controls and compliance systems and other measures to protect our intellectual property. We also rely on nondisclosure agreements, confidentiality obligations in contracts, IT security systems and other measures to protect certain customer and supplier information and intellectual property that we have in our possession or to which we have access. The U.S. government and foreign governments have licenses under certain of our intellectual property, including certain patents, which are developed or used in performance of government contracts. Governments may use or authorize others (including our competitors) to use such patents and intellectual property for government and other purposes. Governments may challenge the sufficiency of intellectual property rights we have granted in government contracts and attempt to obtain greater rights, which could reduce our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and to compete. In some instances, we have augmented our technology base by licensing the proprietary intellectual property of others. Intellectual property obtained from third parties is also subject to challenge, invalidation, misappropriation or circumvention by third parties. In addition, we may not be able to obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms. In other instances, our ability to procure and perform government contracts requires us to obtain certain rights in the intellectual property of others through government grants. Governments may deny us the right to obtain such rights in the intellectual property of others, which may affect our ability to perform government contracts. Moreover, our efforts to protect intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient. We cannot be sure that our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents to us, that patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to preclude our competitors from introducing technologies similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the U.S. In addition, we may be the target of competitor or other third-party patent enforcement actions seeking substantial monetary damages or seeking to prevent our sale and marketing of certain of our products or services. Our competitive position also may be adversely impacted by limitations on our ability to obtain possession of, and ownership of necessary licenses concerning, data important to the development or provision of our products or service offerings, or by limitations on our ability to restrict the use by others of data related to our products or services. We may also be subject to disruptions, losses and liability resulting from various cybersecurity attacks or information technology failures, as described above. Any of these events or factors could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, subject us to judgments, penalties and significant litigation costs, or temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. LEGAL, ENVIRONMENTAL AND REGULATORY RISKS As a U.S. government contractor, we are subject to risks relating to U.S. government audits, investigations, and disputes. We are subject to U.S. government investigations relating to our U.S. government contracts. Such U.S. government investigations often take years to complete and could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, including repayments, fines, treble and other damages, forfeitures, restitution or penalties, or could lead to suspension or debarment of U.S. government contracting or of export privileges. For instance, if we or one of our business units were charged with wrongdoing in connection with a U.S. government investigation (including fraud, or violation of certain environmental or export laws, as further described below), the U.S. government could suspend us from bidding on or receiving awards of new U.S. government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings. If convicted or found liable, the U.S. government could fine and debar us from new U.S. government contracting for a period generally not to exceed three years and could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud. We also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, even if such allegations are later determined to be unsubstantiated. Further, our U.S. government contracts are subject to audit and we have received audit reports recommending the reduction of certain contract prices because, for example, cost or pricing data disclosures or cost accounting practices used to price and negotiate those contracts may not have conformed to government regulations. Some of these audit reports recommend that certain payments be repaid, delayed, or withheld, and may involve substantial amounts, which could, if the audit reports’ theories were to prevail in litigation, also have future impacts such as increasing the costs absorbed by our commercial businesses. We have made voluntary refunds in those cases we believe appropriate, have settled some allegations and, in some cases, continue to negotiate and/or litigate. We may be, and have been, required to make significant payments into escrow of disputed liabilities while the related litigation is pending. If the litigation is resolved in our favor, any such payments will be returned to us with interest. The Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) and the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) also review the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies, including our accounting, purchasing, government property, estimating, earned value management and material management accounting systems. Our final allowable incurred costs for each year are subject to audit and have from time to time resulted in disputes between us and the U.S. government, including DCMA claims to recover payments for alleged noncompliance with cost accounting standards. In some cases, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has convened grand juries to 21 Table of Contents investigate possible irregularities in our costs. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed by the U.S. government or must be refunded by us to the U.S. government if already reimbursed. An adverse outcome of any audit or investigation could result in civil and criminal penalties and fines, which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, if allegations of impropriety were made against us, we could suffer serious reputational harm, which could negatively affect our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. We are subject to litigation, environmental, anti-corruption and other legal and compliance risks. We are subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks. These risks relate to, among other things, product safety and reliability, personal injuries, intellectual property rights, contract-related claims, government contracts, taxes, environmental matters, export control, employment matters, competition laws and laws governing improper business practices. We or one of our businesses could be charged with wrongdoing as a result of such matters. If convicted or found liable, we could be subject to significant fines, penalties, repayments, or other damages (in certain cases, treble damages). Product recalls and product liability and warranty claims can result in significant damages and costs, including fines as well as other harm to our business as discussed above. As a global business, we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the U.S. and in other countries in which we operate. Those laws and regulations may be interpreted in different ways. They may also change from time to time, as may related interpretations and other guidance. Changes in laws or regulations could result in higher expenses. Uncertainty relating to laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights. We use hazardous substances and generate hazardous wastes in our operations. As a result, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to personal injuries or property damage that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures. Personal injury lawsuits may involve individual and purported class actions alleging that contaminants originating from our current or former products or operating facilities caused or contributed to medical conditions, including cancers incurred by employees, former employees, third-parties’ employees or residents in the area, and environmental damage or diminution of real estate values. For example, we are investigating and remediating contamination related to past practices at a number of properties and, in some cases, have been named as a defendant in related “toxic tort” claims. We are also subject to laws and regulations that: (1) impose requirements for the proper management, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes; (2) restrict air and water emissions from our operations (including U.S. government-owned facilities we manage); and (3) require maintenance of a safe workplace. These laws and regulations can lead to substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations, and may require the installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions, decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases, and/or reduce the risks of injury to people. We incur, and expect to continue to incur, capital and other expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations. A criminal violation of certain U.S. environmental statutes such as the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act could result in suspension, debarment or disqualification by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). A facility determined to be in violation of the criminal provisions of these statutes can be prohibited from performing any U.S. government contract work until the violation has been corrected and the EPA approves the reinstatement of the facility. Even in litigation where we believe our liability is remote, there is a risk that a negative finding or decision in a matter involving multiple plaintiffs or a purported class action could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity, in particular with respect to environmental claims in regions where we have, or previously had, significant operations. In addition, new laws, regulations, or governmental policies, sudden changes in the interpretation and enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination, or the imposition of new clean-up standards could require us to incur additional costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, the FCPA and other anti-bribery and -corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to U.S. and non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. These laws apply to companies, individual directors, officers, employees and agents. U.S. companies also may be held liable for actions taken by strategic or local partners or representatives. The FCPA also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded U.S. corporations and their foreign affiliates, which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments. Certain of our customer relationships outside of the U.S. are with governmental entities and are, therefore, subject to the FCPA and other anti-bribery and -corruption laws, including the anti-bribery and -corruption laws of non-U.S. countries. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery and -corruption laws. Despite meaningful measures that we undertake to ensure lawful conduct, which include training and internal control policies, these measures may not always prevent violations of the FCPA or similar laws. We have been subject to regulatory investigations for alleged violations of anti-bribery and -corruption laws, and could be subject to such investigations in the future, which could result in criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement, further changes or enhancements to our procedures, policies and controls, personnel changes or other remedial actions. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our operations, cause reputational harm, involve significant management attention and result in a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. 22 Table of Contents Cybersecurity and data security and protection laws and regulations are evolving and present increasing compliance challenges, which may increase our costs, affect our competitiveness, cause reputational harm, and expose us to substantial fines or other penalties. Our business and financial performance may be adversely affected by climate change, including changes in regulations, customer demand, technologies and extreme weather. Our business may be impacted by climate change and governmental and industry actions taken in response, which present short, medium and long-term risks to our business and financial condition. Changes in environmental and climate-related laws or regulations, including regulations on greenhouse gas emissions, carbon pricing, energy taxes, product efficiency standards, mandatory disclosure obligations and U.S. government procurement requirements, could increase our operational and compliance expenditures and those of our suppliers, including increased energy and raw materials costs and costs associated with manufacturing changes, and lead to new or additional investments in product designs and facility upgrades. In addition, we continue to see ever-increasing demands for offerings focused on addressing climate change, transitioning to lower emission technologies, including low to no carbon products and services, the use of alternative energy sources and other sustainable aviation technologies, and climate adaptation products and services. Customers, shareholders and institutional investors continue to increase their focus on ESG, including our environmental sustainability practices and commitments with respect to our operations, products and suppliers. As a result, we anticipate that we will need to make additional investments in new technologies and capabilities and devote additional management and other resources in response to the foregoing. We may not realize, on a timely basis or at all, the anticipated benefits of these investments and actions for a variety of reasons, including technological challenges, evolving government and customer requirements and our ability to anticipate them and develop in-demand technologies on a timely basis, and other risks related to the development of advanced technologies described above. In addition, certain technologies will be dependent upon government action, such as investments in infrastructure, creating appropriate market incentives and making certain raw materials available for development of certain technologies. Moreover, we rely on our suppliers to timely and effectively adapt and meet our evolving technological supply needs, and they may be unable to fully respond to our requirements in a timely manner or at all. We also face competition risks as our competitors also respond to advancing sustainable technologies. Our competitors may develop these in-demand technologies before we do, their new technologies may be deemed by our customers to be superior to technologies we may develop, and their technologies may otherwise gain industry acceptance in advance of or instead of our products. In addition, as we and our competitors develop increasingly sustainable technologies, demand for our older offerings may decrease or become nonexistent. Our reputation may also be damaged if we or our industry fail, or are perceived to fail, to achieve sustainability goals or commitments or to comply with evolving climate-related regulations. In addition, climate-related litigation and government investigations could be commenced against us, could be costly to defend and could adversely affect our business. Moreover, our business, the businesses of our suppliers, subcontractors, service providers, distributors and customers, and the industries in which we operate could be negatively impacted by increasing frequency and severity of acute extreme weather events caused by climate change, including hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, snow and ice storms, fires, heat waves, and mud slides, and by chronic changes in weather patterns, such as temperature increases, drought and sea level rise. These events could damage our and our suppliers’ facilities, products and other assets, and cause disruptions to our business and operations, supply chain and distribution networks, and the businesses of our customers, and require an increase in expenditures to improve climate resiliency of our operations. Any of the foregoing could materially decrease our revenues and materially increase our costs and expenses. FINANCIAL, TAX AND INSURANCE RELATED RISKS We use estimates in accounting for many of our programs, and changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results. Accounting for long-term contracts and related assets requires estimates and judgments related to our progress toward completion and the long-term performance on the contract. Significant judgments include potential risks associated with the ability and cost to achieve program schedule, including customer-directed delays or reductions in scheduled deliveries, and technical and other specific contract requirements including customer activity levels and variable consideration based upon that activity. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of our performance obligations, the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complex and subject to many variables. Management must make assumptions and estimates regarding contract revenue and cost (such as estimates of variable consideration, including award fees and penalties), including with respect to: (1) labor productivity and availability; (2) the complexity and scope of the work to be performed; (3) the availability and cost of materials; (4) the length of time to complete the performance obligation; (5) execution by our subcontractors; (6) the availability and timing of funding from our customer; (7) overhead cost rates; and (8) current and past service cost and frequency driven by estimated aircraft and engine utilization and estimated useful lives of components, among other variables. Cost estimates may also include the estimated cost of satisfying our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes in the form of either offset obligations or ICIP agreements, required under certain contracts. Because of the significance of management’s judgments and estimation processes described above, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in 23 Table of Contents underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition. Significant changes in key estimates and assumptions with respect to our retirement plans, such as discount rate, expected return on plan assets (EROA), and other actuarial factors, could affect our future earnings, equity and pension contributions. We must determine our pension and other postretirement benefit plans’ expense or income, which involves significant judgment particularly with respect to our discount rate, EROA and other actuarial assumptions. These assumptions are evaluated annually at December 31 and when significant events require a mid-year remeasurement. They may change significantly due to changes in economic, legislative, regulatory, and/or demographic experience or circumstances. Changes in our assumptions or actual experience that differs from these assumptions could impact our pension and postretirement net periodic benefit (income) expense, the plans’ funded status, and/or the required cash contributions to such plans, which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Our plan assets are invested in accordance with our investment management objectives and are subject to market volatility and other conditions. Additional tax expense or exposures could affect our future profitability. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and international jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Changes in tax laws and regulations, as well as changes and conflicts in related interpretations and other tax guidance, and fluctuations in taxable income could materially impact our tax receivables and liabilities and our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, as well as our income tax expense and tax payments. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business, we are subject to examinations by various tax authorities. In addition to ongoing examinations, there could be additional examinations launched in the future by governmental authorities in various jurisdictions, and existing examinations could be expanded. The final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Additionally, changes in the geographic mix of our sales could impact our tax liabilities and affect our income tax expense and profitability. The global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional examinations, proceedings and contingencies will arise from time to time. Our competitive position, results of operation, financial condition or liquidity may be affected by the outcome of examinations, proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty. Goodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant portion of our assets, and any impairment of these assets could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. A significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other intangible assets, primarily recorded as the result of historical acquisitions or investments in businesses. We may subsequently experience unforeseen events that could adversely affect the value of our goodwill or intangible assets. Our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to an impairment test annually and are also tested for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets may be impaired. In the event of an impairment, any excess of the carrying value of these assets over the fair value must be written off in the period of determination. Finite-lived intangible assets are generally amortized over the useful life of such assets. Future determinations of significant impairments of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets as a result of an impairment test or accelerated amortization of finite-lived intangible assets could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We may be unable to obtain debt at competitive rates, on commercially reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts. We depend, in part, upon the issuance of debt to fund our business requirements. If we require additional funding in order to meet our business requirements, a number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt. These factors include disruptions or declines in the global capital markets and/or a decline in our financial performance, outlook or credit ratings. The occurrence of any or all of these events may adversely affect our ability to fund our business requirements. Quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases are subject to uncertainties and may affect our common stock price . Quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases under our share repurchase program generally constitute components of our capital allocation strategy, which we fund through a combination of operating free cash flow, borrowings and proceeds from divestitures. However, we are not required to declare dividends or make any share repurchases under our share repurchase program. Dividends and share repurchases may be discontinued, accelerated, suspended or delayed at any time without prior notice. Even if not discontinued, the amount of such dividends and repurchases may be changed, and the amount, timing and frequency of such dividends and repurchases may vary from historical practice or from the company’s stated expectations. Decisions with respect to dividends and share repurchases are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and are based on a variety of factors. Important factors that could cause us to discontinue, limit, suspend, increase or delay our quarterly cash dividends or share repurchases include market conditions, the price of our common stock, the nature and timing of other investment opportunities, changes in our business strategy, the terms of our financing arrangements, our outlook as to the ability to obtain financing at attractive rates, the impact on our credit ratings, the availability of domestic cash and overall business expectations. The reduction or elimination of our cash dividend, or suspension or elimination of our share repurchase 24 Table of Contents program could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Additionally, there can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance shareowner value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock, and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program’s effectiveness. We face certain significant risk exposures and potential liabilities that may not be adequately covered by indemnity or insurance. A significant portion of our business relates to designing, developing and manufacturing advanced aerospace, defense and technology systems and products. New technologies may be untested or unproven. In addition, we may incur significant liabilities that are unique to our products and services. In some, but not all, circumstances, we may be entitled to indemnification from our customers through contractual provisions, and we may obtain limitations of liability and additional defenses for various reasons including the qualification of our products and services by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) under the SAFETY Act provisions of the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The insurance coverage we maintain or indemnification to which we may be contractually or otherwise entitled may not be adequate to cover all claims or liabilities. Accordingly, we may be forced to bear substantial costs resulting from risks and uncertainties of our business, which would negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Any accident, failure of, or defect in our products and services, even if fully indemnified or insured, could negatively affect our reputation among our customers and the public, and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively. It could also affect the cost and availability of insurance in the future. STRATEGIC INITIATIVE AND TRANSACTION RISKS We may be unable to realize expected benefits from strategic initiatives. In order to operate more effectively and efficiently, from time to time we undertake strategic and other operational initiatives. For example, we are undergoing a significant, multi-year digital transformation initiative to improve our business and reduce costs. Under this initiative, we are leveraging digital capabilities throughout the way in which we conduct our business and provide our products and services to customers, including how we design, build and maintain our products and services. We also continue to engage our Customer Oriented Results Excellence (CORE) operating system to drive continuing improvement into our processes and facilities. In addition, we continue to invest in structural cost reduction in our facilities, including aligning work to more efficient manufacturing centers, implementing advanced manufacturing capabilities including automation, and closing facilities that are not required to meet future capacity and work needs. Other initiatives include the pursuit of advanced technologies and new business acquisitions and subsequent integrations. We also implement restructuring plans from time to time. For example, we recently announced our plans to reorganize our current business segment structure from four to three business segments in the second half of 2023. Restructuring activities include or may result in workforce reductions, global facility reductions, procurement cost reduction activities, legal entity and operational reorganizations and other cost reduction initiatives. These strategic activities are complex and require the investment of resources including in personnel and systems. If we do not successfully manage our current or future strategic initiatives, expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized, and our operations and business could be disrupted. In addition, certain U.S. government contracts and programs have begun to require digital engineering and other digital capabilities, and our inability to achieve these capabilities with respect to these programs timely may result in loss of revenues. Risks associated with workforce management issues include unfavorable political responses to such actions, unforeseen delays in the implementation of anticipated workforce reductions, additional unexpected costs, adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees or work stoppages. Any of the above factors may impair our ability to achieve anticipated benefits, or otherwise harm our business, or have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. We may be unable to successfully complete the integration of the legacy businesses of United Technologies Corporation (UTC) and Raytheon Company and realize the anticipated benefits of the Raytheon merger. The ultimate success of the Raytheon merger continues to depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine and integrate UTC and Raytheon Company’s legacy businesses, and realize the anticipated benefits, including synergies, cost savings, innovation and technological opportunities (including technology-driven revenue synergies) and operational efficiencies from the Raytheon merger in a manner that does not materially disrupt existing customer, supplier and employee relations and does not result in decreased revenues due to losses of, or decreases in orders by, customers. We continue to be exposed to risks associated with our ability to identify and achieve revenue synergy opportunities among the legacy businesses. In addition, we may be unable to consolidate all of the corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminate all of the duplicative operations which we intend, and continue to be at risk for unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems. Any one of these challenges could result in delays, increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues, reduced expected cash generation, and diversion of management’s time and energy, which could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. If we fail to manage potential future acquisitions, investments, divestitures, joint ventures and other transactions successfully, these activities could adversely affect our future financial results. In pursuing our business strategies, we continually review, evaluate and consider potential investments, acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures and other teaming and 25 Table of Contents collaborative arrangements. We undertake to identify opportunities that will complement our existing products and services or customer base, as well as expand our offerings and business opportunities into new areas that naturally extend from our core capabilities. In evaluating such transactions, we are required to make difficult judgments regarding the value of business opportunities, technologies and other assets, and the risks and cost of potential liabilities. Further, these transactions involve certain other risks and uncertainties including: (1) the risks involved with entering new markets; (2) the difficulty in integrating newly-acquired businesses and managing or monitoring other collaborative business arrangements; (3) the complexity of separating a portion of our business to enable a divestiture; (4) challenges and failures in achieving strategic objectives and other expected benefits, which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments; (5) unidentified issues not discovered in RTC’s due diligence; (6) the diversion of our attention and resources from our operations and other initiatives; (7) the potential impairment of acquired assets; (8) the performance of underlying products, capabilities or technologies; and (9) the potential loss of key employees and customers of acquired businesses. In addition, future transactions may impact our deployment of capital, including dividends, stock repurchases, pension contributions, and investments. If either distribution of the stock of Carrier or Otis, together with certain related transactions, were to fail to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free, including as a result of subsequent acquisitions of our stock (including pursuant to the Raytheon merger), we could be subject to significant tax liabilities. On April 3, 2020, UTC completed the Separation Transactions. UTC distributed all of the outstanding shares of Carrier common stock and all of the outstanding shares of Otis common stock to UTC shareowners who held shares of UTC common stock as of the close of business on March 19, 2020, the record date for the distributions (the Distributions) effective at 12:01 a.m., Eastern Time, on April 3, 2020.We received (1) a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regarding certain U.S. federal income tax matters relating to the Separation Transactions and Distributions and (2) an opinion of outside counsel regarding the qualification of certain elements of the Distributions under Section 355 of the Code. Although we intend for the Distributions generally to be tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, there can be no assurance that they will so qualify. Even if the Distributions were to otherwise qualify as tax-free transactions under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, either Distribution or both Distributions may result in taxable gain to us (but not our stockholders) under Section 355(e) of the Code if such Distribution(s) were deemed to be part of a plan (or series of related transactions) pursuant to which one or more persons acquire, directly or indirectly, shares representing a 50% or greater interest (by vote or value) in shares of Carrier, Otis, or us, as applicable. If the IRS were to determine that any post-Distribution acquisitions of Carrier stock, Otis stock, or our stock, as applicable, pursuant to such a plan (when aggregated with any pre-Distribution acquisitions of Carrier stock, Otis stock, or our stock, as applicable, pursuant to such a plan) would represent a 50% or greater interest in shares of Carrier, Otis, or us, as applicable, such determination could result in significant tax liabilities to us. For purposes of this test, even if the Raytheon merger were treated as part of such plan, it did not result in an acquisition of a 50% or greater interest in us. Any such tax liabilities imposed on us may adversely affect an investment in us. In addition, we obtained tax rulings in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions and/or opinions of external tax advisors, in each case, regarding the tax treatment of certain Separation Transactions. Notwithstanding the receipt of such tax rulings and opinions, there can be no assurance that the relevant taxing authorities will not assert that the tax treatment of the relevant Separation Transactions differs from the conclusions reached therein. In the event the relevant taxing authorities prevail with any challenge in respect of any relevant Separation Transaction, we would be subject to significant tax liabilities, which may adversely affect an investment in us. Further, under a tax matters agreement that we entered into with Carrier and Otis in connection with the Separation Transactions and Distributions, each of Carrier and Otis generally is required to indemnify us for certain taxes we may incur resulting from the Separation Transactions and/or the Distributions failing to qualify for the intended tax treatment. In addition, under the tax matters agreement, each of Carrier and Otis is responsible for (i) a specified portion of any installment payment we are required to make pursuant to Section 965(h)(2) of the Code and (ii) specified taxes that exclusively relate to the Carrier business or the Otis business, as applicable. The amount of any such taxes for which we would be responsible may be significant, and if we were unable to obtain indemnification payments from Carrier or Otis to which we are entitled under the tax matters agreement and/or other agreements entered into in connection with the Separation Transactions and the Distributions, we would incur significant losses. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES We have significant properties in approximately 25 countries, with approximately 515 significant properties comprising approximately 75 million square feet of productive space. Approximately 30% of our square footage related to our significant properties is leased, and 70% is owned. Approximately 60% of our square footage related to our significant properties is located in the United States. 26 Table of Contents Our fixed assets as of December 31, 2022 include manufacturing facilities and non-manufacturing facilities such as warehouses, laboratories, office space, and a substantial quantity of machinery and equipment, including general purpose machinery and equipment using special jigs, tools and fixtures and in many instances having automatic control features and special adaptations.

Reserved. 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to provide information to the reader in understanding our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements between select periods and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. In addition, we discuss certain accounting principles, policies and critical estimates that affect our financial statements. Our discussion also contains some additional context regarding our business, including industry considerations and the business environment, as well as certain forward-looking statements related to future events and expectations. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Form 10-K, including Item 1A. “Risk Factors.” BUSINESS OVERVIEW We are a global premier systems provider of high technology products and services to the aerospace and defense industries. We operate in four principal business segmen ts: Collins Aerospace (Collins), Pratt & Whitney, Raytheon Intelligence & Space (RIS) and Raytheon Missiles & Defense (RMD). The Company recently announced its intention to streamline the structure of its core businesses into three principal business segments: Collins Aerospace, Pratt & Whitney and Raytheon. The Company plans to determine the exact composition of each segment and implement the reorganization in the second half of 2023. All segment information included in this Form 10-K is reflective of the existing four segments of Collins, Pratt & Whitney, RIS and RMD in accordance with the management structure in place as of December 31, 2022. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “we,” “our,” “us,” “the Company,” “Raytheon Technologies,” and “RTC” mean Raytheon Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries. Industry Considerations Our worldwide operations can be affected by industrial, economic and political factors on both a regional and global level. Our operations include original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and extensive related aftermarket parts and services related to our aerospace operations. Our defense business serves both domestic and international customers primarily as a prime contractor or subcontractor on a broad portfolio of defense and related programs for government customers. Our business mix also reflects the combination of shorter cycles in our commercial aerospace spares contracts and certain service contracts in our defense business primarily at RIS, and longer cycles in our aerospace OEM and aftermarket maintenance contracts and on our defense contracts to design, develop, manufacture or modify complex equipment. Our customers are in the public and private sectors, and our businesses reflect an extensive geographic diversification that has evolved with continued globalization. Collins and Pratt & Whitney serve both commercial and government aerospace customers. Revenue passenger miles (RPMs), available seat miles and the general economic health of airline carriers are key barometers for our commercial aerospace operations. Performance in the general aviation sector is closely tied to the overall health of the economy and is positively correlated to corporate profits. Many of our aerospace customers are covered under long-term aftermarket service agreements at both Collins and Pratt & Whitney, which are inclusive of both spare parts and services. RIS, RMD, and the defense operations of Collins and Pratt & Whitney are affected by U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) budget and spending levels, changes in demand, changes in policy positions or priorities, the domestic and global political environment and the evolving nature of the global and national security threat environment. In addition, our defense businesses engage in both direct commercial sales, which generally require U.S. government licenses and approvals, as well as foreign military sales, which are government-to-government transactions initiated by, and carried out at the direction of, the U.S. government. Changes in these budget and spending levels, policies, or priorities, which are subject to U.S. domestic and foreign geopolitical risks and threats, may impact our defense businesses, including the timing of and delays in U.S. government licenses and approvals for sales, the risk of sanctions or other restrictions. Government legislation, policies and regulations can impact our business and operations. Changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including regulations on greenhouse gas emissions, carbon pricing, and energy taxes, could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and facility upgrades and could increase our operational and environmental compliance expenditures, including increased energy and raw materials costs and costs associated with manufacturing changes. In addition, government and industry-driven safety and performance regulations, restrictions on aircraft engine noise and emissions, government-imposed travel restrictions and limitations, and government procurement practices can impact our businesses. Business Environment Global economic and political conditions, changes in raw material and commodity prices and supply, labor availability and costs, inflation, interest rates, international and domestic tax law changes, foreign currency exchange rates, energy costs and 30 Table of Contents supply, levels of air travel, the financial condition of commercial airlines, and the impact from natural disasters and weather conditions create uncertainties that could impact our businesses. Global Supply Chain and Labor Markets. Global supply chain and labor markets are continuing to experience high levels of disruption, causing significant materials and parts shortages, including raw material, microelectronics and commodity shortages, as well as delivery delays, labor shortages, distribution problems and price increases. Current geopolitical conditions, including sanctions and other trade restrictive activities and strained intercountry relations, are contributing to these issues. We have had difficulties procuring necessary materials, including raw materials, components and other supplies, and services on a timely basis or at all. We have also had difficulties hiring qualified personnel, particularly personnel with specialized engineering experience and security clearances. Our suppliers and subcontractors have been impacted by the same issues, as well as ongoing pandemic-related issues, compounding the shortages for us because we rely on them, sometimes as sole-source providers. In addition, as the ongoing recovery in commercial air travel continues, the anticipated increase in new aircraft deliveries and increased demand for our products and services will add to these supply chain and labor market challenges. We work continuously to mitigate the effects of these supply chain and labor constraints through targeted activities and ongoing programs. We work with our suppliers and subcontractors to assist in mitigation, arrange supply source alternatives, increase our inventory of available materials and parts, and regularly pursue cost reductions through a number of mechanisms. We also continuously monitor labor market conditions and trends and work to mitigate constraints through talent acquisition, partnership, sourcing and recruiting arrangements, workforce succession planning, and initiatives to attract, retain and rehire former employees. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to negatively affect the global economy, our business and operations, the labor market, supply chains, inflation, and the industries in which we operate, although we continue to see signs of ongoing recovery in commercial air travel. While we believe that the long-term outlook for the aerospace industry remains positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel demand, uncertainty continues with respect to when commercial air traffic capacity will fully return to and/or exceed pre-COVID-19 levels. The pace of the commercial aerospace recovery is tied to general economic conditions and may be impacted by inflation, an economic downturn, or government budget deficits, among other factors, and may also be impacted by a resurgence of the pandemic and corresponding travel restrictions and protocols. Our expectations regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing recovery and their potential financial impact are based on available information and assumptions that we believe are reasonable at this time; however, the actual financial impact is highly uncertain and subject to a wide range of factors and future developments. Geopolitical Matters. In response to the Russian military’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, the U.S. government and the governments of various jurisdictions in which we operate, including Canada, the United Kingdom, the European Union, and others, have imposed broad economic sanctions and export controls targeting specific industries, entities and individuals in Russia. The Russian government has implemented similar counter-sanctions and export controls targeting specific industries, entities and individuals in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate, including certain members of the Company’s management team and Board of Directors. These government measures, among other limitations, restrict transactions involving various Russian banks and financial institutions and impose enhanced export controls limiting transfers of various goods, software and technologies to and from Russia, including broadened export controls specifically targeting the aerospace sector. These measures have adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, the Company and/or our supply chain, business partners or customers. In the quarter ended March 31, 2022, we reversed $1.3 billion of backlog, which would have been recognized over a span of approximately 10 years, and recorded certain impairment charges and increases to reserves related to operations at our Pratt & Whitney and Collins businesses, as discussed further in “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. These adverse impacts have been mitigated in part by the identification of alternative suppliers and an increase in the global demand for our products as a result of the current geopolitical environment. Based on information available to date, we do not currently expect these issues will have a material adverse effect on our financial results. China previously announced that it may take measures against RTC in connection with certain foreign military sales to Taiwan. In addition, China has indicated that it decided to sanction our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Gregory Hayes, in connection with another potential foreign military sale to Taiwan involving RTC products and services. RTC is not aware of any specific sanctions against Mr. Hayes or RTC, or the nature or timing of any future potential sanctions or countermeasures. If China were to impose sanctions or take other regulatory action against RTC, our suppliers, affiliates or partners, it could potentially disrupt our business operations. The impact of potential sanctions or other actions by China cannot be determined at this time. We have direct commercial sales contracts for products and services to certain foreign customers, for which U.S. government review and approval have been pending. The U.S. government’s approval of these sales is subject to a range of factors, including its foreign policies related to these customers, which are subject to continuing review and potential changes. 31 Table of Contents Likewise, regulatory approvals previously granted for prior sales can be paused or revoked if the products and services have not yet been delivered to the customer. If we ultimately do not receive all of the regulatory approvals, or those approvals are revoked, it could have a material effect on our financial results. In particular, as of December 31, 2022, our Contract liabilities include approximately $385 million of advance payments received from a Middle East customer on contracts for which we no longer believe we will be able to execute or obtain required regulatory approvals. These advance payments may become refundable to the customer if the contracts are ultimately terminated. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors” within Part I of this Form 10-K for further discussion. New Legislation. In August 2022, the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) and Sciences Act and the Inflation Reduction Act were signed into law, each effective as of January 1, 2023. These new pieces of legislation include the implementation of a new corporate alternative minimum tax, an excise tax on stock buybacks, and tax incentives for energy and climate initiatives, among other provisions. We are evaluating the legislation and currently do not expect the legislation to have a material impact on our operations, financial condition or liquidity. FINANCIAL SUMMARY We use the following key financial performance measures to manage our business on a consolidated basis and by business segment, and to monitor and assess our results of operations: • Net Sales: a growth metric that measures our revenue for the current year; • Operating Profit (Loss): a measure of our profit (loss) for the year, before non-operating expenses, net and income taxes; and • Operating Profit (Loss) Margin: a measure of our Operating profit (loss) as a percentage of Total Net Sales. (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Total net sales $ 67,074 $ 64,388 $ 56,587 Operating profit (loss) 5,414 4,958 (1,889) Operating profit (loss) margins 8.1 % 7.7 % (3.3) % Operating cash flow from continuing operations $ 7,168 $ 7,142 $ 4,334 In order to better assess the underlying performance of our business, we also focus on the change in organic net sales on both a consolidated basis and business segment basis, and the change in organic operating profit (loss) on a business segment basis, which allows for better year-over-year comparability. See Results of Operations below for our definition of the organic change in Net sales and Operating profit (loss), which are not defined measures under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and may be calculated differently by other companies. We also focus on backlog as a key financial performance measure of our forward-looking sales growth. Total backlog was $175 billion and $156 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Backlog, which is equivalent to our remaining performance obligations (RPO) for our sales contracts, represents the aggregate dollar value of firm orders for which products have not been provided or service has not been performed and excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering-type contracts (e.g., indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) type contracts). Backlog generally increases with bookings and/or orders and generally decreases as sales are recognized on these bookings and is affected by changes in foreign exchange rates, as well as contract cancellations and terminations, and cost underruns on cost-type contracts. In addition, we maintain a strong focus on program execution and the prudent management of capital and investments in order to maximize operating income and cash. We focus on adjusted earnings per share (EPS) and measures to assess our cash generation and the efficiency and effectiveness of our use of capital, such as free cash flow, both of which are not defined measures under U.S. GAAP and may be calculated differently by other companies. Considered together, we believe these metrics are strong indicators of our overall performance and our ability to create shareowner value. We also use these and other performance metrics for executive compensation purposes. A discussion of our results of operations and financial condition follows below in Results of Operations, Segment Review, and Liquidity and Financial Condition. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS As described in our “Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results” of this Form 10-K, our period-to-period comparisons of our results, particularly at a segment level, may not be indicative of our future operating results. The following discussions of comparative results among periods, including the discussion of segment results, should be viewed in this context. The results of RIS and RMD reflect the period subsequent to the completion of the Raytheon merger on April 3, 2020. As such, the results of RIS and RMD for the second quarter of 2020 exclude results prior to the date of completion of the 32 Table of Contents Raytheon merger, the estimated impact of which is approximately $400 million of sales and approximately $45 million of operating profit. These amounts, in addition to the first quarter of 2021 results, have been excluded from the organic changes for the year ended December 31, 2021 disclosed throughout our Results of Operations discussion. In addition, as a result of the separation of United Technologies Corporation’s (UTC’s) business into three independent, publicly traded companies – UTC, Carrier Global Corporation (Carrier) and Otis Worldwide Corporation (Otis) (the Separation Transactions) and the Distributions, the historical results of Carrier and Otis are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. We provide the organic change in Net sales and Cost of sales for our consolidated results of operations as well as the organic change in Net sales and Operating profit (loss) for our segments. We believe that these non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (non-GAAP) measures are useful to investors because they provide transparency to the underlying performance of our business, which allows for better year-over-year comparability. The organic change in Net sales, Cost of sales and Operating profit (loss) excludes Acquisitions and divestitures, net, and the effect of foreign currency exchange rate translation fluctuations and other significant non-operational items and/or significant operational items that may occur at irregular intervals (Other). Additionally, the organic change in Cost of sales and Operating profit (loss) excludes restructuring costs, the FAS/CAS operating adjustment and costs related to certain acquisition accounting adjustments. Restructuring costs generally arise from severance related to workforce reductions and facility exit costs. We are continuously evaluating our cost structure and have implemented restructuring actions in an effort to keep our cost structure competitive. Acquisition accounting adjustments include the amortization of acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions, the amortization of the property, plant and equipment fair value adjustment acquired through acquisitions, the amortization of customer contractual obligations related to loss making or below market contracts acquired, and goodwill impairment. Net Sales (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Total net sales $ 67,074 $ 64,388 $ 56,587 The factors contributing to the total change year-over-year in Total Net Sales are as follows: (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Organic (1) $ 3,660 $ 724 Acquisitions and divestitures, net (676) 6,961 Other (298) 116 Total change $ 2,686 $ 7,801 (1) See “Results of Operations” for definition of organic. A reconciliation of this measure to reported U.S. GAAP amounts is provided in the table above. Net sales increased $3.7 billion organically in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to higher organic sales of $2.5 billion at Pratt & Whitney and $2.4 billion at Collins, partially offset by lower organic sales of $0.6 billion at RMD. The $0.7 billion decrease in net sales related to Acquisitions and divestitures, net in 2022 compared to 2021, was primarily driven by the sale of our global training and services business within our RIS segment in the fourth quarter of 2021 . The decrease in other net sales of $0.3 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 represents the impact of foreign exchange. Net sales increased $0.7 billion organically in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to higher organic sales of $1.3 billion at Pratt & Whitney, partially offset by lower organic sales of $0.6 billion at Collins. The $7.0 billion sales increase in Acquisitions and divestitures, net in 2021 compared to 2020, was primarily driven by the Raytheon merger on April 3, 2020, partially offset by the sale of the Collins military Global Positioning System (GPS) and space-based precision optics businesses in the third quarter of 2020 and the sale of our Forcepoint business in the first quarter of 2021. See “Segment Review” below for further information by segment. % of Total Net Sales (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 Net sales Products sales $ 50,773 $ 49,270 $ 43,319 76 % 77 % 77 % Services sales 16,301 15,118 13,268 24 % 23 % 23 % Total net sales $ 67,074 $ 64,388 $ 56,587 100 % 100 % 100 % Refer to “Note 21: Segment Financial Data” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for the composition of external net sales by products and services by segment. 33 Table of Contents Net products sales increased $1.5 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to increases in external products sales of $1.5 billion at Collins and $1.2 billion at Pratt & Whitney, partially offset by decreases in external products sales of $0.7 billion at RMD and $0.5 billion at RIS. Net services sales increased $1.2 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to increases in external services sales of $1.2 billion at Pratt & Whitney and $0.5 billion at Collins, partially offset by a decrease in external services sales of $0.5 billion at RIS primarily driven by the sale of the global training and services business in the fourth quarter of 2021 . Net products sales increased $6.0 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in external products sales of $3.7 billion at RMD and $3.0 billion at RIS, both primarily due to the Raytheon merger on April 3, 2020, and an increase in external products sales of $1.0 billion at Pratt & Whitney, partially offset by a decrease in external products sales of $1.3 billion at Collins. Net services sales grew $1.9 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in external services sales of $0.8 billion at RIS and $0.4 billion at RMD, both primarily due to the Raytheon merger on April 3, 2020, and an increase in external services sales of $0.4 billion at Pratt & Whitney and $0.3 billion at Collins. Our sales to major customers were as follows: % of Total Net Sales (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 Sales to the U.S. government (1) $ 30,317 $ 31,177 $ 25,962 45 % 48 % 46 % Foreign military sales through the U.S. government 5,042 5,546 4,585 8 % 9 % 8 % Foreign government direct commercial sales 4,327 4,993 3,974 6 % 8 % 7 % Commercial aerospace and other commercial sales 27,388 22,672 22,066 41 % 35 % 39 % Total net sales $ 67,074 $ 64,388 $ 56,587 100 % 100 % 100 % (1) Excludes foreign military sales through the U.S. government.

A reconciliation of this measure to reported U.S. GAAP amounts is provided in the table above. The organic increase in total Cost of sales in 2022 compared to 2021 of $2.4 billion was primarily due to the organic sales increases at Collins and Pratt & Whitney noted above. The decrease related to Acquisitions and divestitures, net of $0.6 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily driven by t he sale of our global training and services business within our RIS segment in the fourth quarter of 2021. The decrease in other cost of sales of $0.2 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily driven by the impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by charges recorded during the first quarter of 2022 at Pratt & Whitney and Collins related to impairment of customer financing assets for products under lease, inventory reserves, purchase order obligations, and the impairment of contract fulfillment costs that are no longer recoverable, all due to global sanctions on and export controls with respect to Russia. See “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. The organic decrease in total Cost of sales in 2021 compared to 2020 of $1.3 billion was primarily due to an organic Cost of sales decrease at Collins and RMD. The Collins decrease was primarily due to the sales decrease noted above, the benefit of cost reduction initiatives, and the absence of prior year significant unfavorable adjustments. The RMD decrease was primarily due to the absence of an unfavorable profit impact of $516 million related to inventory reserves, contract asset impairments and 34 Table of Contents recognition of supplier related obligations for certain international contracts as further described in “Segment Review” below. These decreases in Cost of sales were partially offset by an increase in organic Cost of sales at Pratt & Whitney due to the organic sales increases noted above. The increase related to Acquisitions and divestitures, net of $5.8 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily driven by the Raytheon merger on April 3, 2020, partially offset by the sale of the Collins military GPS and space-based precision optics businesses in the third quarter of 2020, and the sale of our Forcepoint business in the first quarter of 2021 as further discussed in “Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The $0.4 billion decrease in Restructuring is primarily due to the absence of 2020 severance and restructuring actions at Pratt & Whitney and Collins related to the economic environment primarily caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and ongoing cost reduction efforts. For further discussion on FAS/CAS operating adjustment see the “FAS/CAS operating adjustment” subsection under the “Segment Review” section below. For further discussion on Acquisition accounting adjustments, see the “Acquisition accounting adjustments” subsection under the “Segment Review” section below. % of Total Net Sales (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 Cost of sales Products $ 41,927 $ 41,095 $ 38,137 63 % 64 % 67 % Services 11,479 10,802 9,919 17 % 17 % 18 % Total cost of sales $ 53,406 $ 51,897 $ 48,056 80 % 81 % 85 % Net products cost of sales increased $0.8 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to increases at Collins and Pratt & Whitney, partially offset by decreases in Acquisition Accounting Adjustments and RIS. The changes at Collins, Pratt & Whitney and RIS were related to the changes in products sales noted above. Net services cost of sales increased $0.7 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to increases in external services cost of sales at Pratt & Whitney and Collins, partially offset by a decrease in external services sales at RIS, all driven by the services sales changes noted above. Net products cost of sales increased $3.0 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to increases in external products cost of sales at RIS and RMD principally due to the Raytheon merger on April 3, 2020, and an increase in external products cost of sales at Pratt & Whitney, principally driven by the products sales increase noted above, partially offset by a decrease in external products cost of sales at Collins, principally driven by the products sales decrease noted above, the benefit of cost reduction initiatives and the absence of prior year significant unfavorable adjustments. Net services cost of sales grew $0.9 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in external services cost of sales at RIS and RMD principally due to the Raytheon merger on April 3, 2020. Research and Development (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Company-funded $ 2,711 $ 2,732 $ 2,582 Percentage of net sales 4.0 % 4.2 % 4.6 % Customer-funded (1) $ 4,376 $ 4,485 $ 4,111 Percentage of net sales 6.5 % 7.0 % 7.3 % (1) Included in Cost of sales in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Research and development spending is subject to the variable nature of program development schedules and, therefore, year-over-year fluctuations in spending levels are expected. Company-funded research and development in 2022 was relatively consistent with 2021. The increase in company-funded research and development of $0.2 billion in 2021 compared to 2020, was primarily driven by $0.2 billion related to the Raytheon merger on April 3, 2020. The decrease in customer-funded research and development of $0.1 billion in 2022 compared to 2021, was primarily driven by lower expenses on various programs at RMD, partially offset by an increase in expenses on the Next Generation Interceptor (NGI) program at RMD. The increase in customer-funded research and development of $0.4 billion in 2021 compared to 2020, was primarily driven by $0.6 billion related to the Raytheon merger on April 3, 2020, partially offset by lower expenses of $0.2 billion on various military and commercial programs at Pratt & Whitney and lower expenses of $0.1 billion at Collins primarily related to the sale of the military GPS and space-based precision optics businesses in the third quarter of 2020. 35 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Selling, general and administrative $ 5,663 $ 5,224 $ 5,540 Percentage of net sales 8.4 % 8.1 % 9.8 % Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $0.4 billion in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily driven by higher information technology-related costs at Corporate, Collins and Pratt & Whitney, and higher combined expenses at Collins and Pratt & Whitney principally driven by higher employee-related costs and $0.1 billion of charges related to increased estimates for credit losses due to global sanctions on and export controls with respect to Russia. See “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information on Russia sanctions. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $0.3 billion in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily driven by the absence of $0.4 billion of prior year charges related to increased estimates of expected credit losses due to customer bankruptcies and additional allowances for credit losses at our Pratt & Whitney and Collins segments, lower costs of $0.3 billion due to the sale of our Forcepoint business in the first quarter of 2021, and lower general and administrative restructuring costs of $0.3 billion primarily related to 2020 severance and restructuring actions at Collins and Corporate related to the economic environment primarily caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Raytheon merger and ongoing cost reduction efforts, partially offset by an increase in expenses of $0.4 billion related to the Raytheon merger, and higher employee-related costs. Other Income, Net (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Other income, net $ 120 $ 423 $ 885 Other income, net includes equity earnings in unconsolidated entities, royalty income, foreign exchange gains and losses, and other ongoing and nonrecurring items. The decrease in Other income, net of $0.3 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to the absence of a gain of $269 million on the sale of RIS’s global training and services business in the fourth quarter of 2021, as further discussed in “Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K, $69 million of charges associated with the disposition of two non-core businesses at Collins in the second quarter of 2022, a $42 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2022 associated with a divestiture of a small non-core Naval Power business at RMD, and the absence of prior year foreign government wage subsidies related to COVID-19 at Pratt & Whitney of $41 million, partially offset by the absence of an accrual of $147 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 related to the ongoing Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation into contract pricing matters at RMD. The decrease in Other income, net of $0.5 billion in 2021 compared to 2020, was primarily due to the absence of $595 million of gains on the sales of the Collins businesses, in the third quarter of 2020, a decrease of $178 million of foreign government wage subsidies related to COVID-19 at Pratt & Whitney and Collins and an accrual of $147 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 related to the ongoing DOJ investigation into contract pricing matters at RMD, partially offset by a gain of $269 million on the sale of RIS’s global training and services business in the fourth quarter of 2021. The remaining change was spread across multiple items with no common or significant driver. Operating Profit (Loss) (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Operating profit (loss) $ 5,414 $ 4,958 $ (1,889) Operating profit (loss) margin 8.1 % 7.7 % (3.3) % The increase in Operating profit (loss) of $0.5 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily driven by a decrease in Acquisition accounting adjustments, the operating performance at our operating segments and a decrease in Corporate and Eliminations and other, partially offset by the change in our FAS/CAS operating adjustment, all of which are described below in “Segment Review.” The change in Operating profit (loss) of $6.8 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily driven by the operating performance at our operating segments, including the impact of the Raytheon merger, the absence of the $3.2 billion goodwill impairment in the second quarter of 2020 related to two Collins reporting units, and an increase in our FAS/CAS operating adjustment of $690 million primarily as a result of the Raytheon merger. Included in the increase in Operating profit was a decrease in restructuring costs of $625 million primarily related to 2020 restructuring actions taken at our Collins and Pratt & Whitney segments and the absence of 2020 unfavorable profit impact of $516 million related to inventory reserves, contract 36 Table of Contents asset impairments and recognition of supplier related obligations for certain international contracts at RMD as further described in “Segment Review” below. Non-service Pension Income (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Non-service pension (income) $ (1,889) $ (1,944) $ (902) The change in Non-service pension income of $0.1 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily driven by the impact of an increase in discount rates, partially offset by prior years’ pension asset returns exceeding our expected return on plan assets (EROA) assumption. The change in Non-service pension income of $1.0 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily driven by the decrease in the discount rates at December 31, 2020 compared to the prior period, the Raytheon Company domestic defined benefit pension plan amendment described below and prior years’ pension asset returns exceeding our EROA assumption. In December 2020, we approved a change to the Raytheon Company domestic defined benefit pension plans for non-union participants to cease future benefit accruals based on an employee’s years of service and compensation under the historical formula effective December 31, 2022. The plan change does not impact participants’ historical benefit accruals. Benefits for service after December 31, 2022 will be based on a cash balance formula. Interest Expense, Net (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Interest expense $ 1,300 $ 1,330 $ 1,430 Interest income (70) (36) (42) Other non-operating expense (income) (1) 46 28 (22) Interest expense, net $ 1,276 $ 1,322 $ 1,366 Total average interest expense rate - average outstanding borrowings during the year: 4.0 % 4.1 % 4.0 % Total average interest expense rate - outstanding borrowings as of December 31: 4.0 % 4.0 % 4.2 % (1) Primarily consists of the gains or losses on assets associated with certain of our nonqualified deferred compensation and employee benefit plans, as well as the gains or losses on liabilities associated with certain of our nonqualified deferred compensation plans. Interest expense, net in 2022 was relatively consistent with 2021. Interest expense, net in 2021 was relatively consistent with 2020. Included in Interest expense, net was a decrease in interest expense primarily due to the repayment of long-term debt. Income Taxes 2022 2021 2020 Effective income tax rate 11.6 % 15.9 % (24.4) % The 2022 effective tax rate includes a benefit of $214 million related to the Foreign Derived Intangible Income (FDII) benefit, $207 million associated with legal entity and operational reorganizations implemented in 2022, and $164 million associated with U.S. research and development credits. The increase in the FDII benefit from 2021 is primarily attributable to the capitalization of research or experimental expenditures for tax-purposes, enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 effective beginning January 1, 2022. The 2021 effective tax rate includes tax benefits of $244 million associated with legal entity and operational reorganizations implemented in 2021, $172 million associated with U.S. research and development credits and $121 million associated with FDII, and tax charges of $73 million associated with the revaluation of deferred taxes resulting from the increase in the United Kingdom (U.K.) corporate tax rate to 25% enacted in 2021. In the first quarter of 2021, we recorded $148 million of tax charges associated with the sale of the Forcepoint business, and subsequently recognized a $104 million tax benefit due to the revaluation of that tax benefit as a result of completing the divestiture of RIS’s global training and services business for a gain in the fourth quarter of 2021. 37 Table of Contents The 2020 negative effective tax rate is a result of having tax expense of $575 million on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $2.4 billion. The loss from continuing operations before income taxes in 2020 includes the $3.2 billion goodwill impairment, most of which was non-deductible for tax purposes. Tax expense includes net deferred tax charges of $416 million resulting from the Separation Transactions and the Raytheon merger primarily related to the impairment of deferred tax assets and the revaluation of certain international tax incentives, and incremental tax expense of $177 million related to the disposal of businesses, including the sales of businesses at Collins, the airborne tactical radios business at RIS and the entry into a definitive agreement to sell Forcepoint. Also included in the 2020 effective tax rate are tax benefits of $142 million associated with U.S. research and development credits and $83 million associated with FDII. For additional discussion of income taxes and the effective income tax rate, see “Income Taxes” within Critical Accounting Estimates, below, and “Note 13: Income Taxes” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Net Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations Attributable to Common Shareowners (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2022 2021 2020 Net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners $ 5,216 $ 3,897 $ (3,109) Diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations $ 3.51 $ 2.58 $ (2.29) Net income from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners for 2022 includes the following: • acquisition accounting adjustments of $1.5 billion, net of tax, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.99; • impairment charges and reserve adjustments related to the global sanctions on and export controls with respect to Russia of $210 million, net of tax, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.14; • combined charges associated with disposition of businesses at Collins and RMD of $102 million, net of tax, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.07; and • restructuring charges of $91 million, net of tax, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.06. Net income from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners for 2021 includes the following: • acquisition accounting adjustments primarily related to the Raytheon merger of $1.7 billion, net of tax, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $1.13; • net debt extinguishment costs of $524 million, net of tax, in connection with the early repayment of outstanding principal, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.35; • tax benefits of $244 million associated with legal entity and operational reorganizations implemented in the third quarter 2021, which had a favorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.16; • tax expense of $148 million related to the sale of our Forcepoint business in the first quarter of 2021, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.10, and the subsequent revaluation of that tax benefit of $104 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, due to the completion of the divestiture of RIS’s global training and services business for a gain, which had an favorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.07; • accrual of $147 million related to the ongoing DOJ investigation into contract pricing matters at RMD, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.10; • restructuring charges of $121 million, net of tax, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.08; and • gain on the sale of our global training and services business within our RIS segment of $126 million, net of tax, which had a favorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.08. Net loss from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners for 2020 includes the following: • $3.2 billion of primarily non-deductible goodwill and intangibles impairment charges related to our Collins segment, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $2.37; • acquisition accounting adjustments primarily related to the Raytheon merger of $1.4 billion, net of tax, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $1.06; • significant unfavorable contract adjustments at Pratt & Whitney and Collins of $667 million, net of tax, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.49; • restructuring charges of $598 million, net of tax, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.44; • $415 million of tax charges in connection with the Separation Transactions, including the impairment of deferred tax assets not expected to be utilized, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.31; 38 Table of Contents • unfavorable profit impact at RMD of $412 million, net of tax, related to certain direct commercial sales contracts for precision guided munitions with a certain Middle East customer, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.30; • increased estimates of expected credit losses driven by customer bankruptcies and additional allowances for credit losses of $300 million, net of tax, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.22; and • gains on the sales of the Collins businesses of $240 million, net of tax, which had a favorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.18. Loss from Discontinued Operations Attributable to Common Shareowners (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2022 2021 2020 Loss from discontinued operations attributable to common shareowners $ (19) $ (33) $ (410) Diluted loss per share from discontinued operations $ (0.01) $ (0.02) $ (0.30) On April 3, 2020, we completed the separation of our commercial businesses, Carrier and Otis. Effective as of that date, the historical results of the Carrier and Otis segments were reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented. See “Note 3: Discontinued Operations” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. Loss from discontinued operations attributable to common shareowners and the related change in diluted loss per share from discontinued operations in 2022 was relatively consistent with 2021. The change in Loss from discontinued operations attributable to common shareowners of $377 million and the related change in diluted loss per share from discontinued operations of $0.28 in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to higher prior year costs associated with the separation of our commercial businesses, including debt extinguishment costs of $611 million, net of tax, in connection with the early repayment of outstanding principal, partially offset by prior year Carrier and Otis operating activity, as the Separation Transactions occurred on April 3, 2020. Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Shareowners (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2022 2021 2020 Net income (loss) attributable to common shareowners $ 5,197 $ 3,864 $ (3,519) Diluted earnings (loss) per share from operations $ 3.50 $ 2.56 $ (2.59) The changes in Net income (loss) attributable to common shareowners and diluted EPS from operations for 2022 compared to 2021 and for 2021 compared to 2020 were driven by the changes in continuing operations, as discussed above in Net Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations Attributable to Common Shareowners and the changes from discontinued operations, as discussed above in Loss from Discontinued Operations Attributable to Common Shareowners. SEGMENT REVIEW We operate in four principal business segments: Collins, Pratt & Whitney, RIS and RMD. The results of RIS and RMD reflect the period subsequent to the completion of the Raytheon merger on April 3, 2020. The historical results of Carrier and Otis are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. The Company recently announced its intention to streamline the structure of its core businesses into three principal business segments: Collins Aerospace, Pratt & Whitney and Raytheon. The Company plans to determine the exact composition of each segment and implement the reorganization in the second half of 2023. All segment information included in this Form 10-K is reflective of the existing four segments of Collins, Pratt & Whitney, RIS and RMD in accordance with the management structure in place as of December 31, 2022. For a detailed description of our businesses, see “Business” within Item 1 of this Form 10-K. We present a FAS/CAS operating adjustment outside of segment results, which represents the difference between the service cost component of our pension and postretirement benefit (PRB) expense under the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) requirements of U.S. GAAP and our pension and PRB expense under U.S. government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) primarily related to our RIS and RMD segments. While the ultimate liability for pension and PRB costs under FAS and CAS is similar, the pattern of cost recognition is different. Over time, we generally expect to recover the related RIS and RMD pension and PRB liabilities through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government. Collins and Pratt & Whitney generally record pension and PRB expense on a FAS basis. Segments are generally based on the management structure of the businesses and the grouping of similar operations, based on capabilities and technologies, where each management organization has general operating autonomy over diversified products 39 Table of Contents and services. Segment Total Net Sales and Operating profit (loss) include intercompany sales and profit, which are ultimately eliminated within Eliminations and other, which also includes certain smaller non-reportable segments. Segment results exclude certain acquisition accounting adjustments, the FAS/CAS operating adjustment and certain corporate expenses, as further discussed below. We provide the organic change in Net sales and Operating profit (loss) for our segments as discussed above in “Results of Operations”. We believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they provide transparency to the underlying performance of our business, which allows for better year-over-year comparability. For Pratt & Whitney only, Other also includes the transactional impact of foreign exchange hedging at Pratt & Whitney Canada due to its significance to Pratt & Whitney’s overall operating results. Given the nature of our business, we believe that Total Net Sales and Operating profit (loss) (and the related operating profit (loss) margin percentage), which we disclose and discuss at the segment level, are most relevant to an understanding of management’s view of our segment performance, as described below. Total Net Sales. Total Net Sales by segment were as follows: (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Collins Aerospace $ 20,597 $ 18,449 $ 19,288 Pratt & Whitney 20,530 18,150 16,799 Raytheon Intelligence & Space 14,312 15,180 11,069 Raytheon Missiles & Defense 14,863 15,539 11,396 Total segment 70,302 67,318 58,552 Eliminations and other (1) (3,228) (2,930) (1,965) Consolidated $ 67,074 $ 64,388 $ 56,587 (1) Includes the operating results of certain smaller non-reportable business segments. 2020 amounts include Forcepoint, LLC, which was acquired as part of the Raytheon merger, and subsequently disposed of on January 8, 2021. Operating Profit (Loss). Operating profit (loss) by segment was as follows: (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Collins Aerospace $ 2,343 $ 1,759 $ 1,466 Pratt & Whitney 1,075 454 (564) Raytheon Intelligence & Space 1,342 1,833 1,020 Raytheon Missiles & Defense 1,519 2,004 880 Total segment 6,279 6,050 2,802 Eliminations and other (1) (174) (133) (107) Corporate expenses and other unallocated items (2) (318) (552) (590) FAS/CAS operating adjustment 1,520 1,796 1,106 Acquisition accounting adjustments (3) (1,893) (2,203) (5,100) Consolidated $ 5,414 $ 4,958 $ (1,889) (1) Includes the operating results of certain smaller non-reportable business segments. 2020 amounts include Forcepoint, LLC, which was acquired as part of the Raytheon merger, and subsequently disposed of on January 8, 2021. (2) Includes the net expenses related to the U.S. Army’s Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS) project. (3) 2020 includes the $3.2 billion goodwill impairment loss in the second quarter of 2020 related to two Collins reporting units. Refer to “Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets” in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. Included in segment Operating profit (loss) are Estimate at Completion (EAC) adjustments, which relate to changes in Operating profit (loss) and margin due to revisions to total estimated revenues and costs at completion. These changes may reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance, as well as changes in facts and assumptions related to contract options, contract modifications, incentive and award fees associated with program performance, customer activity levels, and other customer-directed changes. For a full description of our EAC process, refer to “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Given that we have thousands of individual contracts and given the types and complexity of the assumptions and estimates we must make on an on-going basis and the nature of the work required to be performed under our contracts, we have both favorable and unfavorable EAC adjustments in the ordinary course. 40 Table of Contents We had the following aggregate EAC adjustments for the periods presented: (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Gross favorable $ 1,368 $ 1,286 $ 994 Gross unfavorable (1,405) (1,176) (1,637) Total net EAC adjustments $ (37) $ 110 $ (643) As a result of the Raytheon merger, RIS’s and RMD’s long-term contracts that are accounted for on a percentage of completion basis, were reset to zero percent complete as of the merger date because only the unperformed portion of the contract at the merger date represented an obligation of the Company. This had the impact of reducing gross favorable and unfavorable EAC adjustments for these segments in the short term period following the merger, most notably in 2020. The change in net EAC adjustments of $147 million in 2022 compared 2021 was primarily due to unfavorable changes in net EAC adjustments of $183 million at RMD and $108 million at RIS, including the impact of acquisitions and dispositions, both spread across numerous individual programs, with no individual or common significant driver, and includes the impact of continued supply chain and labor market constraints. These unfavorable changes were partially offset by a favorable change in net EAC adjustments of $119 million at Collins, spread across numerous individual programs, with no individual or common significant driver, and a favorable change in net EAC adjustments of $26 million at Pratt & Whitney primarily due to a $50 million favorable contract adjustment resulting from a contract modification on a commercial aftermarket program in the second quarter of 2022. The change in net EAC adjustments of $753 million in 2021 compared 2020 was primarily due to a favorable change in net EAC adjustments of $635 million at Pratt & Whitney, due to the absence of significant unfavorable contract adjustments in 2020, and a favorable change in net EAC adjustments of $126 million at RIS and $40 million at RMD, primarily due to the Raytheon merger. This was partially offset by an unfavorable change in net EAC adjustments of $48 million at Collins spread across numerous individual programs with no individual or common significant driver. Significant EAC adjustments, when they occur, are discussed in each business segment’s discussion below. Backlog and Defense Bookings. Total backlog was approximately $175 billion and $156 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Our backlog by segment, which does not include intercompany backlog, was as follows at December 31: (dollars in billions) 2022 2021 Collins Aerospace $ 25 $ 24 Pratt & Whitney 100 85 Raytheon Intelligence & Space 16 18 Raytheon Missiles & Defense 34 29 Total backlog $ 175 $ 156 Included in total backlog is defense backlog of $69 billion and $63 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our defense operations consist primarily of our RIS and RMD businesses and operations in the defense businesses within our Collins and Pratt & Whitney segments. Defense bookings were approximately $47 billion, $40 billion and $31 billion for 2022, 2021 and 2020 respectively. In the quarter ended March 31, 2022, we reversed $1.3 billion of total backlog related to our sales contracts in Russia at Pratt & Whitney and Collins as discussed further in “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Backlog, which is equivalent to our RPO for our sales contracts, represents the aggregate dollar value of firm orders for which products have not been provided or service has not been performed and excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering-type contracts (e.g., IDIQ type contracts). Backlog generally increases with bookings and generally decreases as sales are recognized on these bookings and is affected by changes in foreign exchange rates, as well as contract cancellations and terminations as discussed further below. We believe defense bookings are an important measure of future performance for our defense operations and are an indicator of potential future changes in these operations’ Total Net Sales, because we cannot record revenues under a new contract without first having a booking in the current or a preceding period. Defense bookings generally represent the dollar value of new external defense contracts awarded to us during the reporting period and include firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated. Defense bookings exclude unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering-type contracts (e.g., IDIQ type contracts). We reflect contract cancellations and terminations, as well as the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, 41 Table of Contents directly as an adjustment to backlog in the period in which the cancellation or termination occurs and the impact is determinable. Contract cancellations and terminations also include contract underruns on cost-type programs. Collins Aerospace % Change (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022 compared with 2021 2021 compared with 2020 Net sales $ 20,597 $ 18,449 $ 19,288 12 % (4) % Operating profit 2,343 1,759 1,466 33 % 20 % Operating profit margins 11.4 % 9.5 % 7.6 % 2022 Compared with 2021 Factors Contributing to Total Change (dollars in millions) Organic (1) Acquisitions / Divestitures, net Restructuring Costs Other Total Change Net sales $ 2,384 $ (49) $ — $ (187) $ 2,148 Operating profit 724 (12) 19 (147) 584 2021 Compared with 2020 Factors Contributing to Total Change (dollars in millions) Organic (1) Acquisitions / Divestitures, net Restructuring Costs Other Total Change Net sales $ (574) $ (333) $ — $ 68 $ (839) Operating profit 653 (91) 320 (589) 293 (1) See “Segment Review” above for definition of organic. A reconciliation of these measures to reported U.S. GAAP amounts is provided in the table above. 2022 Compared with 2021 The organic sales increase of $2.4 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily relates to higher commercial aerospace aftermarket sales of $1.7 billion, including increases across all aftermarket sales channels, and higher commercial aerospace OEM sales of $1.0 billion, both principally driven by the recovery of commercial air traffic which has resulted in an increase in flight hours, aircraft fleet utilization and narrow-body commercial OEM volume growth. These increases were partially offset by lower military sales of $0.3 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily due to lower material receipts and decreased volume. The organic profit increase of $0.7 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to higher commercial aerospace operating profit of $1.2 billion principally driven by the higher commercial aerospace aftermarket sales discussed above, partially offset by the absence of a favorable $52 million impact from a contract-related matter in 2021. The increase in commercial aerospace operating profit was partially offset by lower military operating profit of $0.2 billion principally driven by the lower military sales discussed above, and higher selling, general and administrative expenses of $0.2 billion, which includes the benefits of cost reduction initiatives. The decrease in net sales and operating profit due to acquisitions / divestitures, net primarily relates to the disposition of two non-core businesses in the second quarter of 2022. The decrease in Other operating profit of $0.1 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily relates to $141 million of pretax charges related to increased estimates for credit losses, inventory reserves, recognition of purchase order obligations and a loss resulting from the exit of our investment in a Russia-based joint venture, all due to global sanctions on and export controls with respect to Russia in the first quarter of 2022. In addition, we recognized $69 million of charges associated with the disposition of two non-core businesses in the second quarter of 2022. See “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” within Item 1 of this Form 10-K for additional information on Russia sanctions. 2021 Compared with 2020 The organic sales decrease of $0.6 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily relates to lower commercial aerospace OEM sales of $0.8 billion, predominantly due to wide body volume declines principally driven by lower 787 deliveries. This was partially offset by higher commercial aerospace aftermarket sales of $0.3 billion primarily due to an increase in flight hours and aircraft fleet utilization as commercial aerospace continued to recover from the unfavorable economic environment principally driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Military sales were down slightly in 2021 compared to 2020. 42 Table of Contents The organic profit increase of $0.7 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to higher commercial aerospace operating profit of $0.5 billion and lower selling, general and administrative expenses of $0.1 billion. The higher commercial aerospace operating profit was principally driven by the higher commercial aerospace aftermarket sales discussed above, the benefit of cost reduction initiatives, the absence of $157 million of prior year significant unfavorable adjustments, and a $52 million favorable impact from a contract-related matter in 2021. The significant unfavorable adjustments in 2020 were primarily driven by the expected acceleration of fleet retirements of a certain aircraft type. The lower selling, general and administrative expenses were primarily driven by the absence of a $125 million charge for allowances for credit losses in 2020, primarily related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Included in organic profit in 2020 was $72 million of foreign government wage subsidies related to COVID-19. The decrease in net sales and operating profit due to acquisitions / divestitures, net primarily relates to the sale of our Collins military GPS and space-based precision optics businesses in the third quarter of 2020, as further discussed in “Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The decrease in other operating profit of $0.6 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily relates to the absence of prior year gains of $595 million on the sales of the Collins military GPS and space-based precision optics businesses. Pratt & Whitney % Change (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022 compared with 2021 2021 compared with 2020 Net sales $ 20,530 $ 18,150 $ 16,799 13 % 8 % Operating profit (loss) 1,075 454 (564) 137 % 180 % Operating profit (loss) margins 5.2 % 2.5 % (3.4) % 2022 Compared with 2021 Factors Contributing to Total Change (dollars in millions) Organic (1) Acquisitions / Divestitures, net Restructuring Costs Other Total Change Net sales $ 2,478 $ — $ — $ (98) $ 2,380 Operating profit (loss) 773 — (13) (139) 621 2021 Compared with 2020 Factors Contributing to Total Change (dollars in millions) Organic (1) Acquisitions / Divestitures, net Restructuring Costs Other Total Change Net sales $ 1,255 $ — $ — $ 96 $ 1,351 Operating profit (loss) 702 — 173 143 1,018 (1) See “Segment Review” above for definition of organic. A reconciliation of these measures to reported U.S. GAAP amounts is provided in the table above. 2022 Compared with 2021 The organic sales increase of $2.5 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily reflects higher commercial aftermarket sales of $1.8 billion primarily due to an increase in shop visits and related spare part sales as the commercial aerospace environment continues to recover. The increase also includes higher commercial OEM sales of $0.9 billion driven by favorable mix and higher volume on commercial engine shipments. These increases were partially offset by lower military sales of $0.2 billion primarily due to lower sales on F135 production volume and lower volume on legacy aftermarket programs, partially offset by higher F135 sustainment volume. The organic profit increase of $0.8 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily driven by higher commercial aerospace operating profit of $1.1 billion principally due to the aftermarket sales volume increase discussed above and favorable OEM mix. The organic profit increase also includes slightly higher military operating profit primarily driven by favorable mix. These increases were partially offset by a combined increase in selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development costs of $0.3 billion. The year over year increase in commercial aerospace operating profit includes a $50 million favorable contract adjustment on a commercial aftermarket program in the second quarter of 2022. In 2021, our organic profit included approximately $50 million related to foreign government wage subsidies due to COVID-19. The decrease in other operating profit of $0.1 billion in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to $155 million of pretax charges related to impairment of customer financing assets for products under lease, increased estimates for credit losses, 43 Table of Contents inventory reserves and recognition of purchase order obligations, all due to global sanctions on and export controls with respect to Russia in the first quarter of 2022. See “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” within Item 1 of this Form 10-K for additional information on Russia sanctions. 2021 Compared with 2020 The organic sales increase of $1.3 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily reflects higher commercial aftermarket sales of $1.2 billion, primarily due to an increase in shop visits and related spare part sales driven by the recovery from the unfavorable economic environment largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and higher commercial OEM sales of $0.1 billion. Prior year commercial aftermarket sales include unfavorable EAC adjustments of $0.4 billion, discussed further below. These increases were partially offset by lower military sales of $0.1 billion in 2021 compared to 2020. The organic profit increase of $0.7 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily driven by higher commercial aerospace operating profit of $0.7 billion principally due to favorable change in net EAC adjustments of $0.6 billion, and lower selling, general and administrative expenses of $0.1 billion. The higher commercial aerospace operating profit also includes the impact of the aftermarket sales volume increase discussed above, which was partially offset by lower commercial OEM operating profit due to unfavorable mix on the increased sales volume. The lower year-over-year unfavorable commercial aerospace EAC adjustments were principally driven by prior year unfavorable EAC adjustments including a $334 million unfavorable EAC adjustment on a commercial engine aftermarket contract due to lower estimated revenues driven by a change in the estimated maintenance coverage period, an unfavorable EAC adjustment of $129 million related to lower estimated revenues due to the restructuring of a customer contract, and $86 million related to an unfavorable EAC adjustment and increased allowances for warranty for legacy fleet related retrofits. The lower selling, general and administrative expenses were primarily driven by the absence of a $257 million charge in 2020 for allowances for credit losses, partially offset by higher employee-related costs. The change in organic operating profit was also impacted by $106 million of lower government wage subsidies, and the absence of prior year unfavorable EAC adjustments on certain commercial aftermarket and military programs . The increase in other operating profit of $0.1 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily driven by the absence of an $89 million impairment of commercial aircraft program assets and $43 million of reserves related to a commercial financing arrangement, both recorded in 2020. Defense Bookings – In addition to a number of smaller bookings, in 2022 Pratt & Whitney booked $4.9 billion for F135 production Lots 15, 16 and 17, $1.4 billion for F135 sustainment, $251 million for tanker production Lots 7 and 8 and $210 million for F117 sustainment.

The lower Command, Control and Communications sales were primarily driven by an anticipated decrease in production volumes on certain tactical communications systems programs. The higher Cyber, Training and Services sales were driven by certain classified cyber programs. The higher Sensing and Effects sales were primarily driven by an increase in sales on classified programs and an increase due to certain electro-optical development programs transitioning into production, partially offset by a decrease in surveillance and targeting systems due to lower production volume on certain legacy programs. The decrease in operating profit of $0.5 billion and the related decrease in operating profit margins in 2022 compared to 2021, were primarily due to an unfavorable change in mix and other performance of $0.3 billion driven by the absence of a prior year $239 million gain, net of transaction costs, on the sale of the global training and services business, as further discussed in “Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K and acquisition / divestitures, net of $0.1 billion described below. The decrease in net sales and operating profit due to acquisitions / divestitures, net primarily relates to the sale of the global training and services business in the fourth quarter of 2021. 2021 Compared with 2020 Organic sales in 2021 were relatively consistent with 2020. The increase in net sales due to acquisitions / divestitures, net primarily relates to the Raytheon merger on April 3, 2020. The increase in operating profit of $0.8 billion and the related increase in operating profit margins in 2021 compared to 2020, were primarily due to the change in acquisitions / divestitures, net of $399 million, primarily due to the Raytheon merger on April 3, 2020, a favorable change in mix and other performance of $292 million primarily due to a $239 million gain, net of transaction costs, on the sale of RIS’s global training and services business in December 2021, as further discussed in “Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K, and the net favorable change in EAC adjustments of $132 million, which was primarily driven by the absence of $124 million of unfavorable EAC adjustments in 2020 for loss reserves related to a domestic classified fixed price development program in a net loss position. Backlog and Bookings – Backlog was $16 billion at December 31, 2022 compared to $18 billion at December 31, 2021. In addition to a number of smaller bookings, in 2022, RIS booked $5.0 billion on a number of classified contracts, and a major award for a prototype Missile Track Custody system for the U.S. Space Force. RIS also booked $311 million on the Next-Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (Next-Gen OPIR) GEO missile warning and defense contract for the U.S. Space Force, $271 million to provide communications satellite payloads to a commercial customer, and $253 million on the Development, Operations and Maintenance (DOMino) cyber program for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

These decreases were partially offset by higher net sales of $0.4 billion from our Strategic Missile Defense programs. The decrease in Land Warfare and Air Defense programs includes lower sales on certain international air and missile defense programs primarily driven by lower material receipts as a result of supply chain constraints and anticipated decreases in production. The decrease in Air Power programs includes lower net sales on the Paveway program and the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) program. The lower net sales in Naval Power programs was driven by lower volume across multiple programs, partially offset by higher net sales from SPY-6 programs. The increased sales in Strategic Missile Defense programs included higher net sales from the Next Generation Interceptor (NGI) program. The decrease in operating profit of $0.5 billion and the related decrease in operating profit margins in 2022 compared to 2021 were primarily due to a change in mix and other performance of $0.3 billion and a net unfavorable change in EAC adjustments of $0.2 billion. The change in mix and other performance includes unfavorable program mix and a $42 million charge associated with a divestiture of a small non-core Naval Power business. The net unfavorable change in EAC adjustments was spread across numerous programs and includes the impact of continued supply chain and labor market constraints. 2021 Compared with 2020 Organic sales in 2021 were relatively consistent with 2020. The increase in net sales due to acquisitions / divestitures, net relates to the Raytheon merger on April 3, 2020. The increase in operating profit of $1.1 billion and the related increase in operating profit margins in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to a change in mix and other performance of $0.6 billion, primarily driven by the absence of an unfavorable profit impact of $516 million in 2020 related to certain international contracts as further described below, and a change in acquisitions / divestitures, net of $0.5 billion due to the Raytheon merger on April 3, 2020. In the fourth quarter of 2020, RMD reversed $119 million of sales for work performed subsequent to the date of the Raytheon merger through the end of the third quarter of 2020, and the related operating profit, on our direct commercial sales contracts for precision guided munitions with a certain Middle East customer, for which we have not yet obtained regulatory approval. Due to the U.S. presidential and congressional elections and the resulting uncertainty surrounding U.S. foreign policy on direct commercial sales for precision guided munitions with this customer, we determined that it was no longer probable that we will be able to obtain regulatory approvals for these contracts. RMD also recognized an unfavorable profit impact of $516 million related to these contracts, primarily related to inventory reserves, contract asset impairments and recognition of supplier related obligations related to termination liability, which we do not expect to be utilized or otherwise directed to other customers. 46 Table of Contents Backlog and Bookings – Backlog was $34 billion at December 31, 2022 compared to $29 billion at December 31, 2021. In 2022, RMD booked $3.5 billion on a number of classified contracts, including a strategic competitive award. RMD also booked $1.1 billion for the SPY-6 Hardware Production and Sustainment contract for the U.S. Navy, $1.0 billion to provide Guidance Enhanced Missile (GEM-T) for an international customer, $1.0 billion for the first Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile (HACM) for the U.S. Air Force, $972 million for AMRAAM for the U.S. Air Force and Navy and international customers, $762 million for AIM-9X Sidewinder short-range air-to-air missiles for the U.S. Navy and Air Force and international customers, $698 million to provide National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS) for Ukraine, $662 million on Stinger for the U.S. Army, $648 million for Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) for the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), $415 million on Evolved Seasparrow Missile (ESSM) for the U.S. Navy and international customers, $405 million on a Surveillance Radar Program (SRP) for an international customer, $384 million for Excalibur Rapid Demonstration Phase 2 for the U.S. Army, $353 million for the Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS) Pre-planned Product Improvement program for the U.S. Army, $247 million on MIR replenishment for an international customer through our consolidated Raytheon-Rafael joint venture, $218 million to provide Patriot engineering support services for the U.S. Army and international customers, $217 million on Tomahawk for the U.S. Navy, $209 million for Naval Strike Missiles (NSM) Coastal Defense System (CDS) for the U.S. Navy, and $207 million for integrated effectors and sensors for Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems (C-UAS) defense system for the U.S. Army. Corporate and Eliminations and other Eliminations and other reflects the elimination of sales, other income and operating profit transacted between segments, as well as the operating results of certain smaller non-reportable business segments, including Forcepoint, which was acquired as part of the Raytheon merger and subsequently disposed of on January 8, 2021, as further discussed in “Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Corporate expenses and other unallocated items consists of costs and certain other unallowable corporate costs not considered part of management’s evaluation of reportable segment operating performance including restructuring and merger costs related to the Raytheon merger, net costs associated with corporate research and development, including the LTAMDS program and certain reserves. Net Sales Operating Profit (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 Eliminations and other $ (3,228) $ (2,930) $ (1,965) $ (174) $ (133) $ (107) Corporate expenses and other unallocated items — — — (318) (552) (590) The increase in eliminations and other sales in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to an increase in intersegment eliminations, principally driven by Collins and RIS. Eliminations and other operating profit in 2022 was relatively consistent with 2021. The increase in eliminations and other sales in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to the sale of our Forcepoint business in the first quarter of 2021 and an increase in intersegment eliminations, principally driven by RIS. The change in eliminations and other operating profit in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to the sale of our Forcepoint business in the first quarter of 2021. The change in corporate expenses and other unallocated items of $234 million in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily driven by the absence of an accrual of $147 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 related to the ongoing DOJ investigation into contract pricing matters at RMD, a decrease in expenses related to the LTAMDS project and lower restructuring costs, partially offset by an increase in information technology-related costs. The change in corporate expenses and other unallocated items of $38 million in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily driven by a decrease in merger-related costs related to the Raytheon merger of $148 million and lower restructuring costs of $112 million, partially offset by an accrual of $147 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 related to the ongoing DOJ investigation into contract pricing matters at RMD and an increase in net expenses related to the LTAMDS project. FAS/CAS operating adjustment The segment results of RIS and RMD include pension and PRB expense as determined under U.S. government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which we generally recover through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government. The difference between our CAS expense and the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) service cost attributable to these segments under U.S. GAAP is the FAS/CAS operating adjustment. The FAS/CAS operating adjustment results in 47 Table of Contents consolidated pension expense in operating profit equal to the service cost component of FAS expense under U.S. GAAP. The segment results of Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney generally include FAS service cost. The CAS expense calculation is different from the FAS requirements and calculation methodology. While the ultimate liability for pension costs under FAS and CAS is similar, the pattern of cost recognition is different. Our CAS pension expense is comprised primarily of CAS service cost, as well as amortization amounts resulting from demographic or economic experience different than expected, changes in assumptions, or changes in plan provisions. Unlike FAS, CAS expense is only recognized for plans that are not fully funded. Consequently, if plans become or cease to be fully funded under CAS due to our asset or liability experience, our CAS expense will change accordingly. The components of the FAS/CAS operating adjustment were as follows: (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 FAS service cost (expense) $ (365) $ (405) $ (354) CAS expense 1,885 2,201 1,460 FAS/CAS operating adjustment $ 1,520 $ 1,796 $ 1,106 The change in our FAS/CAS operating adjustment of $276 million in 2022 compared to 2021 was driven by a $316 million decrease in CAS expense, partially offset by a $40 million decrease in FAS service cost. The decrease in CAS expense was primarily due to an increase in applicable discount rates as a result of U.S. qualified pension plan funding relief included in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA). The change in our FAS/CAS operating adjustment of $690 million in 2021 compared to 2020 was driven by a $741 million increase in CAS expense, partially offset by a $51 million increase in FAS service cost. The increase in our CAS expense was primarily due to the Raytheon merger. In December 2020, we approved a change to the Raytheon Company domestic defined benefit pension plans for non-union participants to cease future benefit accruals based on an employee’s years of service and compensation under the historical formula effective December 31, 2022. The plan change does not impact participants’ historical benefit accruals. Benefits for service after December 31, 2022 will be based on a cash balance formula. Acquisition accounting adjustments Acquisition accounting adjustments include the amortization of acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions, the amortization of the property, plant and equipment fair value adjustment acquired through acquisitions, the amortization of customer contractual obligations related to loss making or below market contracts acquired, and goodwill impairment. These adjustments are not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment results. The components of Acquisition accounting adjustments were as follows: (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Goodwill impairment charge $ — $ — $ (3,183) Amortization of acquired intangibles (1,912) (2,404) (2,142) Amortization of property, plant and equipment fair value adjustment (89) (111) (69) Amortization of customer contractual obligations related to acquired loss-making and below-market contracts 108 312 294 Acquisition accounting adjustments $ (1,893) $ (2,203) $ (5,100) 48 Table of Contents Acquisition accounting adjustments related to acquisitions in each segment were as follows: (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Collins Aerospace $ (800) $ (641) $ (3,926) Pratt & Whitney (243) (160) (117) Raytheon Intelligence & Space (303) (563) (394) Raytheon Missiles & Defense (547) (838) (607) Total segment (1,893) (2,202) (5,044) Eliminations and other — (1) (56) Acquisition accounting adjustments $ (1,893) $ (2,203) $ (5,100) The change in the Acquisition accounting adjustments of $0.3 billion in 2022 compared to 2021, is primarily driven by a decrease in RIS and RMD intangibles amortization related to the Raytheon merger, partially offset by the absence of $116 million of amortization of customer contractual obligations due to the accelerated liquidation of below-market contract reserves at Collins in 2021 driven by the termination of two customer contracts. The change in the Acquisition accounting adjustments of $2.9 billion in 2021 compared to 2020, is primarily driven by the absence of the $3.2 billion goodwill impairment loss in the second quarter of 2020 related to two Collins reporting units partially offset by an increase of $0.4 billion for acquisition accounting adjustments related to the Raytheon merger, primarily due to the timing of the merger in 2020. Included in Acquisition accounting adjustments in 2021 was $116 million of amortization of customer contractual obligations due to the accelerated liquidation of below-market contract reserves at Collins driven by the termination of two customer contracts. Refer to “Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information on the goodwill impairment. LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Cash and cash equivalents $ 6,220 $ 7,832 Total debt 31,914 31,485 Total equity 74,178 74,664 Total capitalization (total debt plus total equity) 106,092 106,149 Total debt to total capitalization 30 % 30 % We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. Our principal source of liquidity is cash flows from operating activities. In addition to operating cash flows, other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include: capital expenditures, customer financing requirements, investments in and divestitures of businesses, dividends, common stock repurchases, pension funding, access to the commercial paper markets, adequacy of available bank lines of credit, redemptions of debt and the ability to attract long-term capital at satisfactory terms. At December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $6.2 billion, of which approximately 34% was held by RTC’s foreign subsidiaries. We manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. The Company does not intend to reinvest certain undistributed earnings of its international subsidiaries that have been previously taxed in the U.S. Taxes associated with the future remittance of these earnings have been recorded. For the remainder of the Company’s undistributed international earnings, unless tax effective to repatriate, RTC will continue to permanently reinvest these earnings. Historically, our strong credit ratings and financial position have enabled us to issue long-term debt at favorable market rates. As of December 31, 2022, we had revolving credit agreements with various banks permitting aggregate borrowings of up to $7.0 billion, consisting of a $5.0 billion revolving credit agreement, which expires in April 2025, and a $2.0 billion revolving credit agreement, which was renewed in September 2022 and expires in September 2023. As of December 31, 2022, there were no borrowings outstanding under these agreements. From time to time, we use commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes, including the funding of potential acquisitions, pension contributions, debt refinancing, dividend payments and repurchases of our common stock. The commercial paper notes have original maturities of not more than 364 days from the date of issuance. As of December 31, 2022, our maximum commercial paper borrowing limit was $5.0 billion as the commercial paper is backed by our $5.0 billion revolving credit agreement. We had $0.5 billion of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2022, which is reflected in Short-term borrowings in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The proceeds from these borrowings have primarily been used to 49 Table of Contents fund payments related to the impact of a provision enacted in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 requiring the capitalization of research and experimental expenditures for tax purposes. At December 31, 2022, short-term commercial paper borrowings outstanding had a weighted-average interest rate of 4.4%. We have an existing universal shelf registration statement, which we filed with the Securities and E xchange Commission (SEC) on September 22, 2022, for an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities for future issuance, subject to our internal limitations on the amount of debt to be issued under this shelf registration statement. The Company offers voluntary supply chain finance (SCF) programs with global financial institutions which enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables from the Company to the financial institutions at a rate that leverages our credit rating, which might be beneficial to them. Our suppliers’ participation in the SCF programs does not impact or change our terms and conditions with those suppliers, and therefore, we have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to participate in the programs. In addition, we do not pay for any of the costs of the programs incurred by those suppliers that choose to participate, and have no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions, as it relates to sales of receivables made by those suppliers. As such, the SCF programs do not impact our working capital, cash flows or overall liquidity. We believe our cash on hand and future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs. Further, we continue to have access to the commercial paper markets and our existing credit facilities, and our ability to obtain debt or equity financing, as well as the availability under committed credit lines, provides additional potential sources of liquidity should they be required or appropriate. Cash Flow - Operating Activities (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Net cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations $ 7,168 $ 7,142 $ 4,334 Net cash flows used in operating activities from discontinued operations — (71) (728) 2022 Compared with 2021 Operating Activities - Continuing Operations Cash flows provided by operating activities in 2022 were relatively consistent with 2021 and benefited from an improvement in working capital, which was more than offset by the net increase in tax payments resulting from a change in tax law discussed below. Included in the change in working capital was a favorable impact from accounts receivable driven by higher collections resulting from increased sales volume and a related increase in factoring as discussed below. The change in working capital also included a favorable impact from contract assets compared to 2021 primarily due to the timing of billings and collections, and increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities primarily driven by higher inventory purchasing activity, deferred revenue and advanced payments. This impact was largely offset by an unfavorable impact from inventory principally due to current year increases to support sales volume growth. The Company enters into various factoring agreements with third-party financial institutions to sell certain of its receivables. Higher sales volume in the current year supported increased factoring activity that resulted in approximately $2.3 billion of increased cash flows provided by operating activities during 2022 , compared to a decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities of $0.2 billion during 2021 . Factoring activity includes amounts factored on certain aerospace receivables at the customers’ request for which we may be compensated by the customer. 2021 Compared with 2020 Operating Activities - Continuing Operations Cash generated from operating activities in 2021 was $2.8 billion higher than 2020. This increase was primarily due to higher net income of $4.1 billion after adjustments for depreciation and amortization, deferred income tax provision, stock compensation costs, net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit, the goodwill impairment charge and debt extinguishment cost s, as well as lower pension and PRB contributions to trusts of $1.0 billion in 2021 compared to 2020. This was partially offset by an unfavorable change in working capital of $1.1 billion in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to activity at the RIS and RMD segments in the first quarter of 2021 with no comparable activity in the first quarter of 2020 as a result of the Raytheon merger. This unfavorable change in working capital at RIS and RMD includes a cash outflow for accounts payable and accrued liabili ties due to the timing of incentive compensation payments. Also included in the total unfavorable change in working capital was an increase in contract assets principally driven by sales in excess of billings at Pratt & Whitney and contractual billing terms on U.S. government and foreign military sales contracts at RMD, and growth in accounts payable and accounts receivable at Collins and Pratt & Whitney due to an increase in sales volume as commercial aerospace recovered. Factoring activity resulted in a decrease of approximately $0.2 billion in cash provided by operating activities during 2021, compared to a decrease of approximately $1.3 billion in cash provided by operating activities during 2020. The year over year 50 Table of Contents favorable impact from factoring activity was primarily due to the significant decline in sales volume in 2020 principally driven by the economic environment primarily due to COVID-19. Operating Activities - Continuing Operations We made pension and PRB contributions to trusts of $94 million, $59 million, and $1,025 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The contributions in 2020 include discretionary contributions of $801 million. We make both required and discretionary contributions to our pension plans. Required contributions are primarily determined by Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) funding rules, which require us to fully fund our U.S qualified pension plans over a rolling seven-year period as determined annually based on the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA) calculated funded status at the beginning of each year. The funding requirements are primarily based on the year’s expected service cost and amortization of other previously unfunded liabilities, which are dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, the level of market interest rates and actuarial assumptions. We can contribute cash or RTC shares to our plans at our discretion, subject to applicable regulations. As of December 31, 2022, the total investment by the U.S. qualified pension plans in RTC shares was less than 1% of total plan assets. In response to the economic environment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress passed the ARPA in March 2021, which included pension funding relief provisions. These provisions extended and expanded upon existing pension funding relief, most notably by increasing the liability interest rates used to determine the required cash contributions for our U.S. qualified pension plans. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act passed by Congress in November 2021 further extended the interest rate pension funding relief provisions included in ARPA. Global pension and PRB cash funding requirements are expected to be approximately $0.4 billion in 2023, which includes benefit payments to be paid directly by the company. We made net tax payments of $2.4 billion, $1.1 billion, and $1.7 billion in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. A provision enacted in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 related to the capitalization of research and experimental expenditures for tax purposes became effective on January 1, 2022. As this provision was not deferred legislatively, we have made incremental tax payments of $1.6 billion in 2022. Included in cash flows from operating activities are payments related to our operating lease obligations. See “Note 12: Leases” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for actual and expected payments on operating lease obligations. In addition, the majority of our cash flows for purchase obligations are classified as cash flows from operating activities. We expect future payments related to our purchase obligations to be $27.6 billion, of which $19.4 billion is payable in 2023. Purchase obligations include current amounts committed for the purchase of goods and services under legally enforceable contracts or purchase orders, and do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future. Approximately 50% of our purchase obligations described above represent purchase orders for products to be delivered under firm contracts with the U.S. government for which we have full recourse under customary contract termination clauses. Operating Activities - Discontinued Operations Cash flows provided by operating activities from discontinued operations in 2022 and 2021 were not significant as the Separation Transactions occurred on April 3, 2020. The $657 million increase in cash flows provided by operating activities from discontinued operations in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily driven by the absence of prior year separation costs as the Separation Transactions occurred in 2020. Cash Flow - Investing Activities (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Net cash flows (used in) provided by investing activities from continuing operations $ (2,829) $ (1,364) $ 3,343 Net cash flows used in investing activities from discontinued operations — — (241) Our investing activities primarily include capital expenditures, cash investments in customer financing assets, investments in and dispositions of businesses, payments related to our collaboration intangible assets and contractual rights to provide product on new aircraft platforms, and settlements of derivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments. 2022 Compared with 2021 Investing Activities - Continuing Operations The $1.5 billion change in cash flows (used in) provided by investing activities in 2022 compared to 2021 primarily relates to the absence of 2021 investments in and dispositions of businesses, as discussed below. 51 Table of Contents 2021 Compared with 2020 Investing Activities - Continuing Operations The $4.7 billion change in cash flows (used in) provided by investing activities in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily relates to the absence of cash acquired in the Raytheon merger in 2020 of $3.2 billion, and investments in and dispositions of businesses, as discussed below. Investing Activities - Continuing Operations There were no material acquisitions in 2022. Investments in businesses in 2021 of $1.1 billion primarily related to the acquisitions of FlightAware at Collins and SEAKR Engineering Inc. at RIS. Investments in businesses in 2020 of $0.4 billion primarily related to the acquisition of Blue Canyon Technologies at RIS. For additional detail, see “Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. There were no material dispositions of businesses in 2022. Dispositions of businesses in 2021 of $1.9 billion, net of cash transferred, primarily related to the sale of our Forcepoint business and the sale of our global training and services business within RIS. Dispositions of businesses in 2020 of $2.6 billion, net of cash transferred, primarily related to the sale of our Collins military GPS and space-based precision optics businesses. For additional detail, see “Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Capital expenditures were $2.3 billion, $2.1 billion and $1.8 billion in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Capital expenditures increased $154 million in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to investments in production facilities at Pratt & Whitney. Capital expenditures increased $339 million in 2021 from 2020, primarily due to increases at RIS and RMD principally driven by the Raytheon merger and increases at Pratt & Whitney. Payments on customer financing assets were $150 million, $231 million, and $280 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in payments in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to fewer engines added to our leased asset pool. The decrease in payments in 2021 compared to 2020 was due to fewer engines added to our leased asset pool, partially offset by increased customer financing. Receipts from customer financing assets were $179 million, $389 million and $368 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in receipts in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily driven by the absence of the prior year sale and leaseback transaction. Receipts in 2021 were relatively consistent with 2020, as both periods included similar sale and leaseback transactions for the sale of equipment. Refer to “Note 12: Leases” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional discussion of these transactions. In 2022, 2021, and 2020 we increased other intangible assets by approximately $487 million, $308 million, $312 million, respectively, which primarily relates to collaboration payment commitments made under our 2012 agreement to acquire Rolls-Royce’s collaboration interests in International Aero Engines AG (IAE) and exclusivity payments made on contractual commitments included within intangible assets that are amortized over the term of the underlying economic benefit. At December 31, 2022, we had commercial aerospace financing and other contractual commitments, including exclusivity and collaboration payment commitments, of approximately $15.3 billion, on a gross basis before reduction for our collaboration partners’ share. Refer to “Note 18: Commitments and Contingencies” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further details on our commercial aerospace financing and other contractual commitments. As discussed in “Note 14: Financial Instruments” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K, we enter into derivative instruments primarily for risk management purposes, including derivatives designated as hedging instruments and those utilized as economic hedges. We operate internationally and in the normal course of business, are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. These fluctuations can increase the costs of financing, investing and operating the business. We have used derivative instruments, including swaps, forward contracts and options, to manage certain foreign currency, interest rate and commodity price exposures. During 2022, 2021, and 2020 we had net cash payments of $205 million, $16 million, and $32 million, respectively, from the settlement of these derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments. Investing Activities - Discontinued Operations Cash flows used in investing activities from discontinued operations in 2022 and 2021 were not significant as the Separation Transactions occurred on April 3, 2020. The $241 million decrease in cash flows used in investing activities from discontinued operations in 2021 compared to 2020 was due to the fact that the Separation Transactions occurred in 2020. 52 Table of Contents Cash Flow - Financing Activities (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Net cash flows used in financing activities from continuing operations $ (5,859) $ (6,756) $ (3,860) Net cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities from discontinued operations — 71 (1,414) Our financing activities primarily include the issuance and repayment of commercial paper and other short-term and long-term debt, payment of dividends and stock repurchases. 2022 Compared with 2021 Financing Activities- Continuing Operations The $0.9 billion change in cash flows used in financing activities in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily driven by the absence of 2021 repayments of long-term debt, including debt extinguishment costs, net of issuances of $0.8 billion and an increase in commercial paper borrowings, net of $0.7 billion, partially offset by an increase in share repurchases of $0.5 billion, as discussed below. 2021 Compared with 2020 - Financing Activities- Continuing Operations The $2.9 billion change in cash flows used in financing activities in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily relates to an increase in share repurchases of $2.3 billion, as discussed below. In addition, in 2021, we had debt repayments, including debt extinguishment costs, of $4.9 billion and long-term debt issuances of $4.1 billion. Financing Activities- Continuing Operations Included in cash flows from financing activities are payments related to our long term debt, including both interest and principal payments. A summary of our long-term debt commitments as of December 31, 2022 was as follows: Payments Due by Period (dollars in millions) 2023 2024 2025 Thereafter Long-term debt—principal $ 588 $ 1,270 $ 1,590 $ 27,801 Long-term debt—future interest 1,257 1,220 1,193 14,552 Our share repurchases were as follows for the years ended December 31: (dollars in millions; shares in thousands) 2022 2021 2020 $ Shares $ Shares $ Shares Shares of common stock repurchased (1) $ 2,803 29,943 $ 2,327 28,003 $ 47 330 (1) Relates to share repurchases that were settled in cash during the period. At December 31, 2022, management had remaining authority to repurchase approximately $6.0 billion of our common stock under the December 12, 2022 share repurchase program. Under this program, shares may be purchased on the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, under accelerated share repurchase programs, and under plans complying with Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We may also reacquire shares outside of the program from time to time in connection with the surrender of shares to cover taxes on vesting of restricted stock and as required under our employee savings plan. Our ability to repurchase shares is subject to applicable law. Our Board of Directors authorized the following cash dividends for the years ended December 31: (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2022 2021 2020 Dividends paid per share of common stock $ 2.160 $ 2.005 $ 2.160 Total dividends paid $ 3,128 $ 2,957 $ 2,732 On February 3, 2023, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.55 per share payable March 23, 2023 to shareowners of record at the close of business on February 24, 2023. Financing Activities - Discontinued Operations Cash flows provided by financing activities from discontinued operations in 2022 and 2021 were not significant as the Separation Transactions occurred on April 3, 2020. The $1.5 billion decrease in cash flows used in financing activities from discontinued operations in 2021 compared to 2020 was due to the fact that the Separation Transactions occurred in 2020. 53 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the Consolidated Financial Statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. The most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below. Actual results in these areas could differ from management’s estimates. Long-Term Contract Accounting. We recognize revenue on an over-time basis for substantially all defense contracts and certain long-term aerospace aftermarket contracts. We measure progress toward completion of these contracts on a percentage of completion basis, generally using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion. Contract costs are incurred over a period of time, which can be several years, and the estimation of these costs requires management’s judgment. We review our Estimates at Completion (EACs) at least annually or when a change in circumstances warrants a modification to a previous estimate. For significant contracts, we review our EACs more frequently. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of the Company’s performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment by management on a contract by contract basis. As part of this process, management reviews information including, but not limited to, any outstanding key contract matters, progress towards completion and the related program schedule, identified risks and opportunities and the related changes in estimates of revenues and costs. The risks and opportunities relate to management’s judgment about the ability and cost to achieve the schedule, consideration of customer-directed delays or reductions in scheduled deliveries, technical requirements, customer activity levels, such as flight hours or aircraft landings, and related variable consideration. Management must make assumptions and estimates regarding contract revenue and costs, including estimates of labor productivity and availability, the complexity and scope of the work to be performed, the availability and cost of materials, including any impact from rising costs or inflation, the length of time to complete the performance obligation, execution by our subcontractors, the availability and timing of funding from our customer, overhead cost rates, and current and past maintenance cost and frequency driven by estimated aircraft and engine utilization and estimated useful lives of components, among others. In particular, fixed-price development programs involve significant management judgment, as development contracts by nature have elements that have not been done before and thus, are highly subject to future unexpected cost changes. Cost estimates may also include the estimated cost of satisfying our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes in the form of either offset obligations or in-country industrial participation (ICIP) agreements, required under certain contracts. These obligations may or may not be distinct depending on their nature. If cash is paid to a customer to satisfy our offset obligations it is recorded as a reduction in the transaction price. Changes in estimates of net sales, cost of sales and the related impact to operating profit on contracts recognized over time are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis, which recognizes the cumulative effect of the profit changes on current and prior periods based on a performance obligation’s percentage of completion in the current period. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of our performance obligations. Our EAC adjustments also include the establishment of and changes to loss provisions for our contracts accounted for on a percentage of completion basis. Net EAC adjustments had the following impact on our operating results: (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2022 2021 2020 Total net sales $ 152 $ 296 $ (407) Operating profit (loss) (37) 110 (643) Income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners (1) (29) 87 (508) Diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners (1) $ (0.02) $ 0.06 $ (0.37) (1) Amounts reflect a U.S. statutory tax rate of 21%, which approximates our tax rate on our EAC adjustments. As a result of the Raytheon merger, Raytheon Company’s contracts accounted for on a percentage of completion basis were reset to zero percent complete as of the merger date, because only the unperformed portion of the contract at the merger date represented the obligation of the Company. This had the impact of reducing EAC adjustments for these segments in the short term period following the merger, most notably in 2020. For additional information related to the Raytheon merger, see “Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 54 Table of Contents Costs incurred for engineering and development of certain aerospace products under contracts with customers are capitalized as contract fulfillment costs, to the extent recoverable from the associated contract margin and customer funding, and subsequently amortized as the products are delivered to the customer. The estimation of contract costs, and margin, considered as part of this recoverability assessment requires significant judgment. See “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion. We regularly assess capitalized contract fulfillment costs for impairment. In 2020, we recognized impairment of $111 million related to contract fulfillment costs in conjunction with the related impacts of the COVID 19 pandemic. Income Taxes. Management believes that our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits, which may be realized over an extended period of time. For those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax carryforwards or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not likely, a valuation allowance is provided. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider available positive and negative evidence including past operating results, projections of future taxable income, the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards. Our projections of future taxable income include estimates and assumptions regarding our volume, pricing, and costs, as well as the timing and amount of reversals of taxable temporary differences. Valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be affected by changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future, we would reduce such amounts through an increase to tax expense in the period in which that determination is made or when tax law changes are enacted. Conversely, if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts, we would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a decrease to tax expense in the period in which that determination is made. In the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax positions. Significant judgment is required when assessing our income tax positions and in determining our tax expense and benefits. Management assesses our tax positions based on an evaluation of the facts, circumstances, applicable tax laws, including regulations, case law, and other interpretive guidance, as well as any other relevant information. Adjustments to our tax positions are made as new information becomes available or when our assessments change. In addition, we have entered into certain internal legal entity restructuring transactions necessary to effectuate the Separation Transactions. We have accrued tax on these transactions based on our interpretation of the applicable tax laws and our determination of appropriate entity valuations. See “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” and “Note 13: Income Taxes” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion. Management has determined that the distributions of Carrier and Otis on April 3, 2020, and certain related internal business separation transactions, qualified as tax-free under applicable law. In making these determinations, we applied the tax law in the relevant jurisdictions to our facts and circumstances and obtained tax rulings from the relevant taxing authorities, tax opinions, and/or other external tax advice related to the concluded tax treatment. If the completed distributions of Carrier or Otis, in each case, or certain internal business separation transactions, were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment, the Company could be subject to significant liabilities, and there could be material adverse impacts on the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity in future reporting periods. Goodwill and Intangible Assets. The assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Intangible assets acquired in business combinations consist of patents, trademarks/tradenames, developed technology, customer relationships, and other intangible assets. The fair value for acquired customer relationship intangibles is determined as of the acquisition date based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the future after-tax cash flows arising from the follow-on revenue from customer relationships that existed on the acquisition date over their estimated lives, including the probability of expected future contract renewals and revenue, less a contributory assets charge, all of which is discounted to present value. The fair value of the trademark and tradename intangible assets are determined utilizing the relief from royalty method which is a form of the income approach. Under this method, a royalty rate based on observed market royalties is applied to projected revenue supporting the tradename and discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. See “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further details. Also included within intangible assets are exclusivity assets, which are payments made to secure certain contractual rights to provide products on new commercial aerospace platforms. At December 31, 2022, our exclusivity assets, net of accumulated amortization, were approximately $2.6 billion, and our remaining estimated commitments, net of collaborator share, were approximately $6.2 billion. We regularly assess the recoverability of these intangibles, which is dependent upon our 55 Table of Contents assumptions around the future success and profitability of the underlying aircraft platforms including the associated aftermarket revenue streams, and the related future cash flows. Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to impairment testing annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired. The impairment test compares carrying values of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets to their estimated fair values. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, then the carrying value is reduced to fair value. In testing our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we may perform both qualitative and quantitative assessments. For the quantitative assessments that are performed for goodwill, we utilize a combination of discounted cash flows (DCF) and market-based valuation methodologies. For the quantitative assessments of indefinite-lived intangible assets, fair value is primarily based on the relief from royalty method. These quantitative assessments incorporate significant assumptions that include sales growth rates, projected operating profit, terminal growth rates, discount rates, royalty rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry. Such assumptions are subject to variability from year to year and are directly impacted by, among other things, global market conditions. We completed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of October 1, 2022 and determined that no adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill were necessary. For those reporting units where we performed a quantitative test, we estimated the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of DCF and market-based valuation methodologies. As noted above, these methodologies involve significant assumptions that are subject to variability. The key assumptions used in our quantitative analysis include our business projections, including revenue growth rates and operating profit margins, the long-term growth rate used to calculate the terminal value of the reporting unit, the discount rate, and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry. We consider both internal and external factors and refresh key assumptions annually or as considered necessary. Material changes in these estimates could occur and result in impairments in future periods. Based on our annual impairment analysis as of October 1, 2022, the reporting units that were closest to impairment were two previously combined Collins reporting units with fair values in excess of book values, including goodwill, of 15% and 17%. The combined value of goodwill allocated to these two reporting units is approximately $9.5 billion as of the date testing was performed. All other reporting units had a fair value substantially in excess of book value. The Company continuously monitors and evaluates relevant events and circumstances that could unfavorably impact the significant assumptions noted above, including changes to U.S. treasury rates and equity risk premiums, tax rates, recent market valuations from transactions by comparable companies, volatility in the Company’s market capitalization, and general industry, market and macro-economic conditions. It is possible that future changes in such circumstances or in the inputs and assumptions used in estimating the fair value of our reporting units, could require the Company to record a non-cash impairment charge. In 2020, we recognized goodwill impairments of $3.2 billion related to two Collins reporting units. Refer to “Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional details. We also completed our annual indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment testing as of October 1, 2022 and determined that no adjustments to the carrying value of these assets were necessary. As noted above, our indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment analysis involves significant assumptions that are subject to variability. Material changes in these assumptions could occur and result in impairments in future periods. Contingent Liabilities. As described in “Note 18: Commitments and Contingencies” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K, contractual, regulatory and other matters in the normal course of business may arise that subject us to claims or litigation, including with respect to matters relating to technical issues on programs, government contracts, performance and operating cost guarantees, employee benefit plans, legal, and environmental, health and safety matter s. In particular, the design, development, production and support of aerospace technologies is inherently complex and subject to risk. Technical issues associated with these technologies may arise in the normal course and may result in financial impacts, including increased warranty provisions, customer contract settlements, and changes in contract performance e stimates. These impacts could be material to the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Additionally, we have significant contracts with the U.S. government, subject to government oversight and audit, which may require significant adjustment of contract prices. We accrue for liabilities associated with these matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Estimating our liability based on both the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes, and the costs associated with these matters, requires significant judgment. The inherent uncertainty related to the outcome of these matters could result in amounts materially different from any provisions made with respect to their resolution. Employee Benefit Plans. We sponsor domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and PRB plans. Assumptions used to calculate our funded status are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators. They are evaluated annually at December 31 and when significant events require a mid-year remeasurement. A change in any of these assumptions 56 Table of Contents or actual experience that differs from these assumptions are subject to recognition in pension and postretirement net periodic benefit (income) expense reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans require judgement. Major assumptions include the discount rate and EROA. Other assumptions include mortality rates, demographic assumptions (such as retirement age), rate of increase in employee compensation levels, and health care cost increase projections. The weighted-average discount rates used to measure pension and PRB liabilities are based on yield curves developed using high-quality corporate bonds, which are subject to macroeconomic factors, as well as plan specific expected cash flows. For our significant plans, we utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit expense by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant discounted projected cash flows. The following table shows the sensitivity of our pension and PRB plan liabilities and net periodic benefit income to a 25 basis point change in the discount rates for benefit obligations, interest cost and service cost as of December 31, 2022: (dollars in millions) Increase in Discount Rate of 25 bps Decrease in Discount Rate of 25 bps Projected benefit obligation increase (decrease) $ (1,144) $ 1,194 Net periodic benefit income increase (decrease) (23) 28 The discount rate sensitivities assume no change in the shape of the yield curve that will be applied to the projected cash outflows for future benefit payments in order to calculate interest and service cost. A flattening of the yield curve results in a narrowing of the spread between interest and obligation discount rates and would decrease our net periodic benefit income. Conversely, a steepening of the yield curve would result in an increase in the spread between interest and obligation discount rates and would increase our net periodic benefit income. The EROA is the average rate of earnings expected over the long term on assets invested to fund anticipated future benefit payment obligations. In determining the EROA assumption, we consider the target asset allocation of plan assets, as well as economic and other indicators of future performance. We consult with and consider the opinions of financial and other professionals in determining the appropriate capital market assumptions. Return projections are validated using a simulation model that incorporates yield curves, credit spreads and risk premiums to project long-term prospective returns. As a result of this analysis at year end 2022, our weighted average pension EROA assumption for 2023 increased to 7.1%. Differences between actual asset returns in a given year and the EROA do not necessarily indicate a change in the assumption is required, as the EROA represents the expected average returns over a long-term horizon. Net periodic benefit income is also sensitive to changes in the EROA. An increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the EROA would have increased or decreased our 2022 net periodic benefit income by approximately $139 million. Refer to “Note 11: Employee Benefit Plans” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for discussion of current and prior year discount rate and EROA assumptions. ACCOUNTING STANDARDS For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see the Accounting Pronouncements section in “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Refer to “Note 18: Commitments and Contingencies” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for discussion on contractual commitments and contingencies. GOVERNMENT MATTERS As described above in “Critical Accounting Estimates—Contingent Liabilities,” our contracts with the U.S. government are subject to audits. Such audits may recommend that certain contract prices should be reduced to comply with various government regulations, or that certain payments be delayed or withheld. We are also the subject of one or more investigations and legal proceedings initiated by the U.S. government with respect to government contract matters. See “Note 18: Commitments and Contingencies” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of these and other government matters. 57 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our primary market exposures are to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as it relates to our market risk sensitive instruments, which are primarily cash, debt and derivative instruments. To quantify our market risk exposure, we perform a sensitivity analysis based on hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Refer to “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles,” “Note 10: Borrowings and Lines of Credit” and “Note 14: Financial Instruments” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional discussion of foreign currency exchange, interest rates and financial instruments. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk. We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies and to various internal or external financing arrangements. We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business and financing. We actively manage foreign currency exposures that are associated with commi tted foreign currency purchases and sales, and other assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business at the operating unit level. More than insignificant exposures that cannot be naturally offset within an operating unit are hedged with foreign currency derivatives. Foreign exchange exposures arising from intercompany loan and deposit transactions are also hedged regularly. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency hedges was $11.2 billion and $8.5 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively . Foreign currency forward contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. A 10% unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have resulted in an increase in unrealized losses of $0.9 billion and $0.6 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Such losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. We believe these foreign currency forward exchange contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments, when taken together, do not create material market risk. Within our aerospace business, our sales are typically denominated in U.S. Dollars. However, for our non-U.S. based entities, such as Pratt & Whitney Canada (P&WC), a substantial portion of their costs are incurred in local currencies. Consequently, there is a foreign currency exchange impact and risk to operational results as U.S. Dollars must be converted to local currencies such as the Canadian Dollar in order to meet local currency cost obligations. Additionally, we transact business in various foreign currencies which exposes our cash flows and earnings to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to minimize the exposure that exists from changes in the exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar against these other currencies, we hedge a certain portion of sales to secure the rates at which U.S. Dollars will be converted. The majority of this hedging activity occurs at P&WC and Collins, and hedging activity also occurs to a lesser extent at the remainder of Pratt & Whitney. At P&WC and Collins, firm and forecasted sales for both original equipment and spare parts are hedged at varying amounts for up to 49 months on the U.S. Dollar sales exposure as represented by the excess of U.S. Dollar sales over U.S. Dollar denominated purchases. Hedging gains and losses resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are partially offset by the foreign currency translation impacts that are generated on the translation of local currency operating results into U.S. Dollars for reporting purposes. While the objective of the hedging program is to minimize the foreign currency exchange impact on operating results, there are typically variances between the hedging gains or losses and the translational impact due to the length of hedging contracts, changes in the sales profile, volatility in the exchange rates and other such operational considerations. Interest Rate Risk. We have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally fixed-rate debt obligations. A 100 basis points unfavorable interest rate movement would have had an approximate $3 billion and $4 billion i mpact on the fair value of our fixed-rate debt at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The investors in our fixed-rate debt obligations generally do not have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, we believe our exposure to interest rate risk on our fixed-rate debt is not material. From time to time, we may hedge to floating rates using interest rate swaps. Currently, we do not hold any derivative contracts that hedge our interest exposures, but may consider such strategies in the future. 58 Table of Contents ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The management of RTC is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Management has assessed the effectiveness of RTC’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in its Internal Control—Integrated Framework , released in 2013 . Management concluded that based on its assessment, RTC’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. The effectiveness of RTC’s internal control over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2022, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein. /s/ GREGORY J. HAYES Gregory J. Hayes President and Chief Executive Officer /s/ NEIL G. MITCHILL, JR. Neil G. Mitchill, Jr. Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer /s/ AMY L. JOHNSON Amy L. Johnson Corporate Vice President and Controller 59 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareowners and Board of Directors of Raytheon Technologies Corporation Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Raytheon Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income (loss), of changes in equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Basis for Opinions The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 60 Table of Contents Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Revenue Recognition - Contract Estimates at Completion As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, a significant portion of the Company’s revenues of $67.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 are from long-term contracts associated with the design, development, manufacture or modification of complex aerospace or defense equipment or related services. The timing of the satisfaction of performance obligations varies across the Company’s businesses due to their diverse product and service mix, customer base, and contractual terms. Substantially all of the Company’s revenues from the Raytheon Intelligence & Space and Raytheon Missiles & Defense segments are recognized over time because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer. The Company’s revenues from certain long-term aftermarket contracts within its Pratt & Whitney segment are recognized over the contract period as a series of daily performance obligations to stand ready to provide spare parts, product maintenance and aftermarket services. For these performance obligations satisfied over time, revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of the Company’s performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment by management on a contract by contract basis. Within the Raytheon Intelligence & Space and Raytheon Missiles & Defense segments, the variables and significant judgments relate to key contract matters, progress towards completion and the related program schedule, identified risks and opportunities and the related changes in estimates of revenues and costs. The risks and opportunities for the contracts relate to management’s ability and cost to achieve the schedule, consideration of customer-directed delays or reductions in scheduled deliveries, technical requirements, customer activity levels and related variable consideration. Management also makes judgments about variables related to estimates of labor productivity and availability, the complexity and scope of the work to be performed, the availability and cost of materials, including any impact from rising costs or inflation, the length of time to complete the performance obligation, execution by the Company’s subcontractors, the availability and timing of funding from the customer, overhead cost rates, and the estimated cost of satisfying the Company’s industrial cooperation agreements required under certain contracts. Within the Pratt & Whitney segment, the variables and significant judgments relate to current and past maintenance cost and frequency experience. Management reviews contract estimates at completion on a periodic basis and no less than annually or when a change in circumstances warrants a modification to a previous estimate. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition - contract estimates at completion is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in developing their estimates of total revenue and total costs at completion, including significant judgments and assumptions on a contract by contract basis, and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to management’s estimates of total revenue and total costs at completion for contracts. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls over the estimates of total revenue and total costs at completion. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the estimated total revenue and total costs at completion, including evaluating on a test basis the reasonableness of certain significant judgments and variables considered by management specific to each contract or performance obligation. Evaluating the significant judgments and assumptions related to the estimates of total revenue and total costs at completion involved evaluating whether the significant judgments and assumptions used were reasonable considering: (i) management’s historical forecasting accuracy, (ii) evidence to support the relevant aforementioned variables, (iii) the consistent application of accounting policies, and (iv) the timely identification of circumstances which may warrant a modification to a previous estimate. 61 Table of Contents Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets Impairment Assessments As described in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets balances were $53.8 billion and $8.6 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2022. A portion of the total goodwill balance relates to certain reporting units of the Collins Aerospace segment. A portion of the total indefinite-lived intangible assets balance relates to the Collins Aerospace segment. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment testing annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired. For the quantitative assessments that are performed, fair value is primarily based on market-based valuation methods, income-based methods using a discounted cash flow model, relief from royalty methods, or a combination of such. These assessments utilize significant assumptions related to sales growth rates, projected operating profit, terminal growth rates, discount rates, royalty rates, and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in the aerospace and defense industry. The impairment testing compares carrying values to estimated fair values. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, then the carrying value is reduced to fair value. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment assessments is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimates of certain reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets of the Collins Aerospace segment, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to sales growth rates, discount rates, and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in the aerospace and defense industry, as applicable, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment assessments, including controls over the valuation of certain reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets of the Collins Aerospace segment. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimates, (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the methodologies used to estimate fair value, (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in developing the estimates, and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to sales growth rates, discount rates, and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in the aerospace and defense industry, as applicable. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to sales growth rates involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the relevant businesses, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the Company’s discounted cash flow, market-based valuation, and relief from royalty methods, and (ii) the reasonableness of the discount rates and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in the aerospace and defense industry assumptions. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Boston, Massachusetts February 6, 2023 We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1947. 62 Table of Contents RAYTHEON TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS (dollars in millions, except per share amounts;

Actual results could differ from those estimates. Separation Transactions, Distributions and Raytheon Merger. On April 3, 2020, United Technologies Corporation (UTC) (since renamed Raytheon Technologies Corporation) completed the separation of its business into three independent, publicly traded companies – UTC, Carrier Global Corporation (Carrier) and Otis Worldwide Corporation (Otis) (the Separation Transactions). UTC distributed all of the outstanding shares of Carrier common stock and all of the outstanding shares of Otis common stock to UTC shareowners who held shares of UTC common stock as of the close of business on March 19, 2020 (the Distributions). Immediately following the Separation Transactions and the Distributions, on April 3, 2020, UTC and Raytheon Company completed their all-stock merger of equals transaction (the Raytheon merger), pursuant to which Raytheon Company became a wholly owned subsidiary of UTC, and UTC was renamed “Raytheon Technologies Corporation.” The historical results of Carrier and Otis are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Unless otherwise indicated, amounts and activity throughout these Consolidated Financial Statements are presented on a continuing operations basis. Refer to “Note 3: Discontinued Operations” below for further details. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “we,” “our,” “us,” “the Company,” “Raytheon Technologies,” and “RTC” mean Raytheon Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries. UTC was determined to be the accounting acquirer in the Raytheon merger and, as a result, the financial statements of Raytheon Technologies for the year ended December 31, 2020 include Raytheon Company’s financial position and results of operations for the period subsequent to the completion of the Raytheon merger on April 3, 2020. Russia Sanctions. In response to the Russian military’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, the U.S. government and the governments of various jurisdictions in which we operate, including Canada, the United Kingdom, the European Union, and others, have imposed broad economic sanctions and export controls targeting specific industries, entities and individuals in Russia. The Russian government has implemented similar counter-sanctions and export controls targeting specific industries, entities and individuals in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate, including certain members of the Company’s management team and Board of Directors. These government measures, among other limitations, restrict transactions involving various Russian banks and financial institutions and impose enhanced export controls limiting transfers of various goods, software and technologies to and from Russia, including broadened export controls specifically targeting the aerospace sector. These measures have adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, the Company and/or our supply chain, business partners or customers. As a result of these sanctions on Russia and export controls, in the first quarter of 2022, we recorded pretax charges of $ 290 million, $ 210 million net of tax and the impact of noncontrolling interest, within our Collins Aerospace (Collins) and Pratt & Whitney businesses primarily related to increased estimates for credit losses on both our accounts receivables and contract assets, inventory reserves and purchase order obligations, impairment of customer financing assets for products under lease, impairment of contract fulfillment costs that are no longer recoverable, and a loss on the exit of our investment in a Russia-based joint venture. Additionally, we reversed approximately $ 1.3 billion of remaining performance obligations (RPO) in the quarter ended March 31, 2022 related to our sales contracts in Russia at Pratt & Whitney and Collins. We continue to monitor future developments, including additional sanctions and other measures, that could adversely affect the Company and/or our supply chain, business partners or customers. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to negatively affect the global economy, our business and operations, the labor market, supply chains, inflation, and the industries in which we operate. As a result of COVID-19, commercial air travel demand experienced an unprecedented downturn as governments, businesses and individuals reacted to the pandemic in ways such as lockdowns, quarantines, border closings and other travel restrictions and requirements, the adoption of remote working and decreased leisure travel. The unprecedented decrease in air travel adversely affected our airline and airframer customers and their demand for our products and services of our Collins and Pratt & Whitney businesses. In addition, the border closings, lockdowns and labor shortages resulting from COVID-19 negatively impacted global supply and distribution capabilities. Decreases in the availability of supplies, increases in the cost of supplies and delivery issues have caused shortages and delays for the procurement of raw materials, components and other supplies required for our performance, although we continue to see signs of ongoing recovery in commercial air travel. While we believe that the long-term outlook for the aerospace industry remains positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel demand, uncertainty continues with respect to when commercial air traffic capacity will fully return to and/or exceed pre-COVID-19 levels. The pace of the commercial aerospace recovery is tied to general economic conditions and may be impacted by inflation, an economic downturn, or government budget deficits, among other factors, and may also be impacted by a resurgence of the pandemic and corresponding travel restrictions and protocols. Our expectations regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and 68 Table of Contents ongoing recovery and their potential financial impact are based on available information and assumptions that we believe are reasonable at this time; however, the actual financial impact is highly uncertain and subject to a wide range of factors and future developments. In 2020, we recorded write-downs of assets and significant unfavorable Estimate at Completion (EAC) adjustments in our Collins and Pratt & Whitney businesses primarily related to: • goodwill impairment charges of $ 3.2 billion related to two of our Collins reporting units. Refer to “Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets” for additional information; • increased estimated credit losses on both our receivables and contract assets of $ 387 million; • an unfavorable EAC adjustment on a Pratt & Whitney commercial engine aftermarket contract due to lower estimated revenues driven by a change in the estimated maintenance coverage period of $ 334 million; • contract asset and inventory impairments at Collins due to the impact of lower estimated future customer activity resulting from the expected acceleration of fleet retirements of a certain commercial aircraft type of $ 146 million; • an unfavorable EAC adjustment of $ 129 million related to lower estimated revenues due to the restructuring of a customer contract at Pratt & Whitney; • an $ 89 million impairment of commercial aircraft program assets at Pratt & Whitney; • the impairment of a Collins trade name of $ 57 million; • net unfavorable EAC adjustments on commercial aftermarket contracts at Pratt & Whitney based on a change in estimated future customer activity of $ 75 million; • an unfavorable EAC adjustment at Pratt & Whitney related to a shift in overhead costs to military contracts of $ 44 million; and • reserves related to a commercial financing arrangement at Pratt & Whitney of $ 43 million. Summary of Accounting Principles. The following represents the significant accounting principles of Raytheon Technologies Corporation. Consolidation and Classification. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Raytheon Technologies Corporation, and all wholly owned, majority-owned and otherwise controlled domestic and foreign subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. For our consolidated non-wholly owned subsidiaries, a noncontrolling interest is recognized to reflect the portion of equity that is not attributable to us. For classification of certain current assets and liabilities, the duration of our contracts or programs is utilized to define our operating cycle, which is generally longer than one year. Included within our Current assets and liabilities are Contract assets and liabilities related to our aftermarket and development arrangements, which can generally span up to fifteen years. We reclassified certain immaterial prior period amounts within the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows to conform to our current period presentation. Use of Estimates. Our Consolidated Financial Statements are based on the application of U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and any such differences may be material to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of changes, if any, are reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements in the period they are determined. Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term cash investments that are highly liquid in nature and have original maturities of three months or less. The estimated fair value of Cash and cash equivalents approximates the carrying value due to their short maturities. Accounts Receivable. Accounts receivable are stated at the net amount expected to be collected. We are exposed to credit losses primarily on our accounts receivable and contract assets related to our sales of products and services to commercial customers. The allowance for expected credit losses is established to provide for the expected lifetime credit losses by evaluating factors such as customer creditworthiness, historical payment and loss experiences, current economic conditions, including geographic and political risk, and the age and status of outstanding receivables. In certain circumstances, we may be able to develop reasonable and supportable forecasts over the contractual term of the financial asset. For periods beyond which we are able to make or obtain reasonable and supportable forecasts, we revert to historical loss experience and information. We determine credit ratings for each customer in our portfolio based upon public information and information obtained directly from our customers. We conduct a review of customer credit ratings, published historical credit default rates for different rating categories, and multiple third-party aircraft value publications as a basis to validate the reasonableness of the allowance for expected credit losses on a quarterly basis, or when events and circumstances warrant. A credit limit is established for each 69 Table of Contents customer based on the outcome of this review and consideration of the other factors discussed above. In certain cases, we may require collateral or prepayment to mitigate credit risk. Expected credit losses are written off in the period in which the financial asset is no longer collectible. Unbilled receivables represent revenues that are not currently billable to the customer under the terms of the contract and include unbilled amounts under commercial contracts where payment is solely subject to the passage of time. These items are expected to be billed and collected in the normal course of business. Accounts receivable as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 includes unbilled receivables of $ 298 million and $ 342 million, respectively, which primarily includes unbilled receivables with commercial aerospace customers. Other unbilled receivables where payment is subject to factors beyond just the passage of time are included in Contract assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Contract Assets and Liabilities. Contract assets and liabilities represent the difference in the timing of revenue recognition from receipt of cash from our customers. Contract assets reflect revenue recognized and performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in advance of customer billing. Contract liabilities relate to payments received in advance of the satisfaction of performance under the contract. We receive payments from customers based on the terms established in our contracts. Contract assets and Contract liabilities are generally classified as current as our operating cycle is generally longer than one year. See “Note 6: Contract Assets and Liabilities” for further discussion of Contract assets and liabilities. As described in more detail above in “Accounts Receivable,” we are exposed to credit losses on our contract assets related to our sales of products and services to commercial customers and regularly assess our allowance for expected credit losses as it relates to our Contract assets. Inventory. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value and is primarily based on first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost methods. Valuation reserves for excess, obsolete, and slow-moving inventory are estimated by comparing the inventory levels of individual parts to both future sales forecasts or production requirements and historical usage rates in order to identify inventory where the resale value or replacement value is less than inventoriable cost. Other factors that management considers in determining the adequacy of these reserves include whether individual inventory parts meet current specifications and can be substituted for a part currently being sold or used as a service part, overall market conditions, and other inventory management initiatives. Manufacturing costs are allocated to current production contracts. In our commercial aerospace businesses, excess costs beyond standard manufacturing costs are expensed when they meet certain thresholds. Equity Investments. Investments in entities we do not control are included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For investments where we have significant influence, we apply the equity method of accounting, and as such, our share of the net earnings or losses of the investee is recorded. For investments where we do not have significant influence, we record them at cost under the measurement alternative and record adjustments for observable price changes. Equity investment income and losses are included in Other income, net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations since the activities of the investee are closely aligned with our operations. We evaluate our equity investments whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amounts of such investments may be impaired. If a decline in the value of an equity method investment is determined to be other than temporary, a loss is recorded in earnings in the current period. Our sales to and purchases from unconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method, which are considered related parties, are not material. Customer Financing Assets . Customer financing assets (CFA) relate to our commercial aerospace businesses in which we provide financing to airline customers. Our financing predominantly relates to products under lease, and to a lesser extent, notes and lease receivables. In certain limited circumstances, we pay deposits on behalf of our airline customers to secure production slots with the airframers, and such pre-delivery payments are included in Accounts receivable, net, if current, and Customer financing assets, if non-current, in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Any unfunded pre-delivery payments are included within our commercial aerospace financing commitments as further discussed in “Note 18: Commitments and Contingencies.” Interest income from notes and financing leases and rental income from operating lease assets is generally included in Other income, net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations, while gains or losses on sales of operating lease assets are included in Products sales and Cost of sales. The current portion of these financing arrangements are aggregated in Accounts receivable, net and the non-current portion of these financing arrangements are aggregated in CFA in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The increases and decreases in CFA from funding, receipts and certain other activity, are generally reflected as Investing Activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Leased assets are valued at cost and reviewed for impairment when circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Notes and lease receivables are valued at the net amount expected to be collected. For notes and lease receivables, we determine a specific reserve for exposure based on the difference between the carrying value of the receivable and the estimated fair value of the related collateral in connection with 70 Table of Contents the evaluation of credit risk and collectability. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the reserves related to CFA were not material. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we did not have any significant balances that are considered to be delinquent, on non-accrual status, past due 90 days or more, or considered to be impaired. Fixed Assets, Net. Fixed assets, net, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Major improvements are capitalized while expenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor improvements are expensed. For asset sales or retirements, the assets and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are eliminated from the accounts. Gains and losses on sales of our Fixed assets, net, are generally recorded in operating income. Business Combinations. Once a business is acquired, the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is determined with the excess cost recorded to goodwill. As required, a preliminary fair value is determined once a business is acquired, with the final determination of the fair value being completed no later than one year from the date of acquisition. In connection with the acquisitions of Rockwell Collins in 2018 and Goodrich in 2012, and to a lesser extent the acquisition of Raytheon Company in 2020, we recorded assumed liabilities related to customer contractual obligations on certain contracts with economic returns that were lower than what could be realized in market transactions as of the acquisition date. We measured these assumed liabilities based on the estimated cash flows of the programs plus a reasonable contracting profit margin required to transfer the contracts to market participants. These liabilities are being amortized in accordance with the underlying pattern of obligations, as reflected by the expenses incurred on the contracts. The balance of the contractual obligations was $ 818 million and $ 929 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Total consumption of the contractual obligations for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 111 million, $ 314 million and $ 295 million, respectively, with future consumption expected to be as follows: $ 104 million in 2023, $ 80 million in 2024, $ 68 million in 2025, $ 67 million in 2026, $ 65 million in 2027 and $ 434 million thereafter. Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to impairment testing annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired. The goodwill impairment test compares carrying values of the reporting units to their estimated fair values. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value then the carrying value is reduced to fair value. In developing our estimates for the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets, significant judgment is required in the determination of the appropriateness of using a qualitative assessment or quantitative assessment. For the quantitative assessments that are performed, fair value is primarily based on market-based valuation methods, income-based methods using a discounted cash flow model, relief from royalty methods, or a combination of such. These assessments utilize significant assumptions including sales growth rates, projected operating profit, terminal growth rates, discount rates, royalty rates, and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry. Such assumptions are subject to variability from year to year and are directly impacted by, among other things, global market conditions. Finite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment when events occur that indicate that the net book value will not be recovered over future cash flows. Intangible assets consist of patents, trademarks/tradenames, customer relationships, exclusivity assets, developed technology and other intangible assets including collaboration assets. Acquired intangible assets are recognized at fair value in purchase accounting. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized to Cost of sales and Selling, general and administrative expenses over the applicable useful lives. Exclusivity assets are commercial aerospace payments made to secure certain contractual rights to provide product on new aircraft platforms. We classify amortization of such payments as a reduction of sales. Such payments are capitalized when there are distinct rights obtained and there are sufficient incremental cash flows to support the recoverability of the assets established. Otherwise, the applicable portion of the payments are expensed. In addition, in connection with our 2012 agreement to acquire Rolls-Royce’s ownership and collaboration interests in International Aero Engines AG (IAE), additional payments are due to Rolls-Royce contingent upon each hour flown through June 2027 by the V2500-powered aircraft in service as of the acquisition date. These flight hour payments are being capitalized as collaboration assets and amortized to cost of sales. Useful lives of finite-lived intangible assets are estimated based upon the nature of the intangible asset and the industry in which the intangible asset is used. These intangible assets are amortized based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed, as represented by the underlying cash flows, which may result in an amortization method other than straight-line. For both our commercial aerospace collaboration assets and exclusivity arrangements, the pattern of economic benefit generally results in no amortization during the development period with amortization beginning as programs enter full rate production and aftermarket cycles. If a pattern of economic benefit cannot be reliably determined or if straight- 71 Table of Contents line amortization approximates the pattern of economic benefit, a straight-line amortization method may be used. The range of estimated useful lives is as follows: Years Collaboration assets 30 Customer relationships and related programs 3 to 30 Developed technology 3 to 25 Patents and trademarks 5 to 30 Exclusivity assets 5 to 25 Leases. As a lessee, we record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases are classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. We enter into lease agreements for the use of real estate space, vehicles, information technology equipment, and certain other equipment under both operating and finance leases. We determine if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in Operating lease right-of-use assets and Operating lease liabilities, non-current on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The current portion of our operating lease liabilities is included in Accrued liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Finance leases are not considered significant to our Consolidated Balance Sheet or Consolidated Statement of Operations. Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments, and use the implicit rate when readily determinable. We determine our incremental borrowing rate through market sources including relevant industry rates. Our lease right-of-use assets also include any initial direct costs and lease pre-payments made at or before the commencement date and are reduced for any lease incentives received at or before the commencement date. Certain of our leases include variable payments, which may vary based upon changes in facts or circumstances after the start of the lease. We exclude variable payments from lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, to the extent such payments are not considered fixed, and instead, expense variable payments as incurred. Variable lease expense and lease expense for short duration contracts are not a material component of lease expense. Some of our leases include the option to extend or terminate the lease. We include these options in the recognition of our right-of-use assets and lease liabilities when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option. Lease expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In limited instances we act as a lessor, primarily for commercial aerospace engines, the majority of which are classified as operating leases. These leases are not significant to our Consolidated Balance Sheet or Consolidated Statement of Operations. Other Long-Lived Assets. We evaluate the potential impairment of other long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of other long-lived assets held and used exceeds the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows, the carrying value is written down to fair value. In order for long-lived assets to be considered held for disposal, we must have committed to a plan to dispose of the assets. Once deemed held for disposal, the assets are stated at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value. Income Taxes. Future income taxes represent the tax effects of transactions which are reported in different periods for tax and financial reporting purposes. These amounts consist of the tax effects of temporary differences between the tax and financial reporting balance sheets and tax carryforwards. Future income tax benefits and payables within the same tax paying component of a particular jurisdiction are offset for presentation in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. I n the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax positions. We assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. Where applicable, associated interest expense has also been recognized. We recognize accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense. Penalties, if incurred, would be recognized as a component of income tax expense. State income tax amounts are generally included in income tax expense; however state income tax payments related to our Raytheon Intelligence & Space (RIS) and Raytheon Missiles & Defense (RMD) segments are generally recoverable through the pricing of products and 72 Table of Contents services to the U.S. government, and, accordingly, we have recorded the future recovery of these costs from the U.S. government within Other assets, current in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Accordingly, these state income taxes are generally allocated to contracts and then classified as Selling, general and administrative expenses when paid (recovered) or otherwise agreed as allocable with the U.S. government. We have elected to account for tax on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income ( GILTI) as a period cost, as incurred. Revenue Recognition. The vast majority of our revenues are from long-term contracts associated with the design, development, manufacture or modification of complex aerospace or defense equipment or related services. Collins and Pratt & Whitney primarily serve commercial and government customers in both the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and aftermarket parts and services markets of the aerospace industry, while RIS and RMD primarily provide products and services to government customers in the defense industry. We account for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. For certain contracts that meet the foregoing requirements, primarily contracts that are directly with a foreign government, we are required to obtain certain regulatory approvals. In these cases, we recognize revenue based on the likelihood of obtaining regulatory approvals based upon all known facts and circumstances. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. Some of our contracts with customers contain a single performance obligation, while others contain multiple performance obligations most commonly when a contract contains multiple distinct units (such as engines or certain aerospace components) or spans multiple phases of the product life-cycle such as production, maintenance and support. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as the performance obligation is satisfied. When there are multiple performance obligations within a contract, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on its standalone selling price when available. If standalone selling price is not available, we estimate the standalone selling price of each performance obligation, which is generally based on an expected cost plus a margin approach. We consider the contractual consideration payable by the customer and assess variable consideration that may affect the total transaction price, including contractual discounts, contract incentive payments, estimates of award fees, flight hours, aircraft landings or other customer usage activities on long term maintenance contracts, and other sources of variable consideration, when determining the transaction price of each contract. When reasonably able to estimate, we include variable consideration in the transaction price at the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled. We include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. These estimates are based on historical experience, anticipated performance and our best judgment at the time. We also consider whether our contracts contain a significant financing component, which they generally do not. Timing of the satisfaction of performance obligations varies across our businesses due to our diverse product and service mix, customer base, and contractual terms. Performance obligations are satisfied as of a point in time for certain aerospace components, engines, and spare parts. Revenue is recognized when control of the product transfers to the customer, generally upon product shipment. Since billing also typically occurs upon product shipment, we generally do not have Contract assets or Contract liabilities balances related to point in time sales. Performance obligations are satisfied over-time if the customer receives the benefits as we perform work, if the customer controls the asset as it is being produced (continuous transfer of control), or if the product being produced for the customer has no alternative use and we have a contractual right to payment for performance to date. We recognize revenue on an over-time basis for substantially all defense contracts and certain long-term aerospace OEM and aftermarket contracts. Substantially all of our defense business revenue, which primarily relates to our RIS and RMD segments, and to a lesser extent Pratt & Whitney and Collins, is recognized over time because of the continuous transfer of control to our customers. For performance obligations satisfied over time, revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis generally using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress. Incurred costs represent work performed, which correspond with and best depict transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs can include labor, materials, subcontractors’ costs, or other direct costs and indirect costs. Our contracts with the U.S. government are typically subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and are priced based on estimated or actual costs of producing goods or providing services. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services provided under U.S. government contracts. The pricing for non-U.S. government contracts is based on the specific negotiations with each customer. Under the typical payment terms of our U.S. government fixed-price contracts, the customer pays us either performance-based payments (PBPs) or progress payments. PBPs are interim payments equal to a negotiated percentage of the 73 Table of Contents contract price based on quantifiable measures of performance or on the achievement of specified events or milestones. Progress payments are interim payments up to 80-90% of costs incurred as the work progresses. Because the customer retains a portion of the contract price until completion of the contract, our U.S. government fixed-price contracts generally result in revenue recognized in excess of billings which we present as Contract assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For our U.S. government cost-type contracts, the customer generally pays us for our costs incurred within a short period of time. For non-U.S. government contracts, we typically receive interim payments as work progresses, although for some contracts, we may be entitled to receive an advance payment. Such advances are not considered a significant financing component because they are used to meet working capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract and to protect us from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract. We recognize a liability for advance payments in excess of revenue recognized and present it as Contract liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For certain of our long-term aftermarket contracts, revenue is recognized over the contract period. We generally account for such contracts as a series of daily performance obligations to stand ready to provide spare parts, product maintenance and aftermarket services. These arrangements include the sale of spare parts with integral services to our customers, and are generally classified as Services sales, with the corresponding costs classified in Cost of sales - services, within the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Revenue is primarily recognized on a percentage of completion basis using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress, as sufficient historical evidence indicates that the cost of performing services under the contract is incurred on an other-than-straight-line basis. For some of our long-term aftermarket contracts, we receive payment prior to delivery of products and services, resulting in a contract liability balance, while for others, we deliver products or services in advance of payment, resulting in a contract asset balance. Contracts are often modified to account for changes in contract specifications or requirements. We consider contract modifications to exist when the modification either creates new or changes existing enforceable rights and obligations. Contract modifications for goods or services that are not distinct are accounted for as part of the existing contract either on a cumulative catch-up basis or prospective basis depending on the nature of the modification. Loss provisions on contracts are recognized to the extent that estimated contract costs exceed the estimated consideration from the products or services contemplated under the contractual arrangement. For new commitments, we generally record loss provisions at contract signing except for certain contracts under which losses are recorded upon receipt of the purchase order that obligates us to perform. For existing commitments, anticipated losses on contractual arrangements are recognized in the period in which losses become evident. In estimating losses, products contemplated under contractual arrangements include firm quantities of product sold under contract and, in the commercial engine and wheels and brakes businesses, future highly probable sales of replacement parts required by regulation that are expected to be sold subsequently for incorporation into the original equipment. In our commercial engine and wheels and brakes businesses, when the OEM product is sold for a loss, but the combined OEM and aftermarket arrangement for each individual sales campaign is profitable, we record OEM product losses at the time of product delivery. We review our Estimates at Completion (EACs) at least annually or when a change in circumstances warrants a modification to a previous estimate. For significant contracts, we review our EACs more frequently. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of the Company’s performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment by management on a contract by contract basis. As part of this process, management reviews information including, but not limited to, any outstanding key contract matters, progress towards completion and the related program schedule, identified risks and opportunities and the related changes in estimates of revenues and costs. The risks and opportunities relate to management’s judgment about the ability and cost to achieve the schedule, consideration of customer-directed delays or reductions in scheduled deliveries, technical requirements, customer activity levels, such as flight hours or aircraft landings, and related variable consideration. Management must make assumptions and estimates regarding contract revenue and costs, including estimates of labor productivity and availability, the complexity and scope of the work to be performed, the availability and cost of materials, including any impact from rising costs or inflation, the length of time to complete the performance obligation, execution by our subcontractors, the availability and timing of funding from our customer, overhead cost rates, and current and past maintenance cost and frequency driven by estimated aircraft and engine utilization and estimated useful lives of components, among others. In particular, fixed-price development programs involve significant management judgment, as development contracts by nature have elements that have not been done before and thus, are highly subject to future unexpected cost changes. Cost estimates may also include the estimated cost of satisfying our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes in the form of either offset obligations or in-country industrial participation (ICIP) agreements, required under certain contracts. These obligations may or may not be distinct depending on their nature. If cash is paid to a customer to satisfy our offset obligations it is recorded as a reduction in the transaction price. Changes in estimates of net sales, cost of sales and the related impact to operating profit on contracts recognized over time are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis, which recognizes the cumulative effect of the profit changes on current and prior periods based on a performance obligation’s percentage of completion in the current period. A significant change in one or 74 Table of Contents more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of our performance obligations. Our EAC adjustments also include the establishment of and changes to loss provisions for our contracts accounted for on a percentage of completion basis. Net EAC adjustments had the following impact on our operating results: (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2022 2021 2020 Total net sales $ 152 $ 296 $ ( 407 ) Operating profit (loss) ( 37 ) 110 ( 643 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners (1) ( 29 ) 87 ( 508 ) Diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners (1) $ ( 0.02 ) $ 0.06 $ ( 0.37 ) (1) Amounts reflect a U.S. statutory tax rate of 21%, which approximates our tax rate on our EAC adjustments. For additional discussion on significant unfavorable EAC adjustments in 2020, see the COVID-19 Pandemic discussion above. As a result of the Raytheon merger, Raytheon Company’s contracts accounted for on a percentage of completion basis were reset to zero percent complete as of the merger date, because only the unperformed portion of the contract at the merger date represented the obligation of the Company. This had the impact of reducing EAC adjustments for these segments in the short term period following the merger, most notably in 2020. For additional information related to the Raytheon merger, see “Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets.” In our Collins and Pratt & Whitney businesses, we may offer customers incentives to purchase our products, which may result in payments made to those customers, which are treated as a reduction in sales. In our Collins and Pratt & Whitney businesses, we incur contract fulfillment costs for engineering and development of aerospace products directly related to existing or anticipated contracts with customers. Such costs generate or enhance our ability to satisfy our performance obligations under these contracts. We capitalize these costs as contract fulfillment costs to the extent the costs are recoverable from the associated contract margin and customer funding, and subsequently amortize the costs as the related performance obligations are satisfied. In instances where intellectual property does not transfer to the customer, we generally defer the customer funding of product engineering and development and recognize revenue when the related performance obligations are satisfied. Capitalized contract fulfillment costs were $ 2.3 billion and $ 2.0 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are classified in Other assets, current in our Consolidated Balance Sheet and are included in Other current assets in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. We regularly assess capitalized contract fulfillment costs for impairment and recognized $ 111 million of impairment for contract fulfillment costs in 2020 in conjunction with the related impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Costs to obtain contracts are not material. In view of the risks and costs associated with developing new engines and the large up-front investments required that often require returns generated over the full estimated life of the engine, Pratt & Whitney has entered into certain collaboration arrangements in which sales, costs and risks are shared. Sales generated from engine programs, spare parts sales, and aftermarket business under these collaboration arrangements are recorded consistent with our revenue recognition policies in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Amounts attributable to our collaborators for their share of sales are recorded as cost of sales in our Consolidated Financial Statements based upon the terms and nature of the arrangement. Costs associated with engine programs under collaborative arrangements are expensed as incurred. Under these arrangements, collaborators contribute their program share of engine parts, incur their own production costs and make certain payments for shared or joint program costs. The reimbursement from collaborators of their share of program costs is recorded as a reduction of the related expense item at that time. As of December 31, 2022, the collaborators’ interests in all commercial engine programs ranged from 13 % to 49 %, inclusive of a portion of Pratt & Whitney’s interests held by other participants. Pratt & Whitney is the principal participant in all existing collaborative arrangements, with the exception of the Engine Alliance (EA), a joint venture with GE Aviation, which provides aftermarket support, spare parts, and service for the GP7000 engine for the Airbus A380 aircraft. There are no individually significant collaborative arrangements, and none of the collaborators individually have more than a 75 Table of Contents 25 % share in an individual program. The following table illustrates the Consolidated Statement of Operations classification and amounts attributable to transactions arising from the collaborative arrangements between participants for each period presented. (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Collaborator share of sales: Cost of sales - products $ 2,058 $ 1,534 $ 1,183 Cost of sales - services 1,808 1,428 1,374 Collaborator share of program costs (reimbursement of expenses incurred): Cost of sales - products ( 154 ) ( 160 ) ( 147 ) Research and development ( 182 ) ( 135 ) ( 177 ) Selling, general and administrative ( 105 ) ( 85 ) ( 99 ) Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO). RPO represents the aggregate amount of total contract transaction price that is unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied. Total RPO was $ 175 billion as of December 31, 2022. In the quarter ended March 31, 2022, we reversed approximately $ 1.3 billion of RPO related to our sales contracts in Russia due to global sanctions on and export controls with respect to Russia, as further discussed above. Of the total RPO as of December 31, 2022, we expect approximately 25 % will be recognized as sales over the next 12 months. Approximately 45 % of our RPO relates to long-term commercial aerospace maintenance contracts at Pratt & Whitney, which are generally expected to be realized over a span of up to 15 years. Research and Development. Company-sponsored research and development costs, including those costs related to the Company’s portion in connection with cost-sharing arrangements, are charged to expense as incurred and recovery on these cost-sharing arrangements is recorded as a reduction to research and development expense as earned. Customer-sponsored research and development projects performed under contracts with customers are accounted for as contract costs and reported as cost of sales on the related revenue generating contracts. Foreign Exchange. We conduct business in many different currencies and, accordingly, are subject to the inherent risks associated with foreign exchange rate movements. The financial position and results of operations of many of our foreign subsidiaries are often measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at the exchange rates existing at the respective balance sheet dates, and income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates during the respective periods. The aggregate effects of translating the balance sheets of these subsidiaries are deferred as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL) in Shareowners’ equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Foreign exchange transaction gains and losses are recorded in Other income, net on our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Derivatives and Hedging Activity. We use derivative instruments, including swaps, forward contracts and options, to help manage certain foreign currency, and from time to time to help manage interest rate and commodity price exposures. Derivative instruments are viewed as risk management tools by us and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. By their nature, all financial instruments involve market and credit risks. We enter into derivative and other financial instruments with major investment grade financial institutions and have policies to monitor the credit risk of those counterparties. We limit counterparty exposure and concentration of risk by diversifying counterparties. While there can be no assurance, we do not anticipate any material non-performance by any of these counterparties. We enter into transactions that are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements with various counterparties. However, we have not elected to offset multiple contracts with a single counterparty and, as a result, the fair value of the derivative instruments in a loss position is not offset against the fair value of derivative instruments in a gain position. Derivatives used for hedging purposes may be designated and effective as a hedge of the identified risk exposure at the inception of the contract. All derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives used to hedge foreign currency denominated balance sheet items are reported directly in earnings along with offsetting transaction gains and losses on the items being hedged. Derivatives used to hedge forecasted cash flows associated with foreign currency commitments or forecasted commodity purchases may be accounted for as cash flow hedges, as deemed appropriate. Gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to earnings as a component of products sales or expenses, as applicable, when the hedged transaction occurs. Cash payments or receipts on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in Other operating activities, net within the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. To the extent that a previously designated hedging transa ction is no longer an effective hedge, any ineffectiveness measured in the hedging relationship is recorded currently in earnings in the period it occurs. To the extent the hedge accounting criteria are not met, the foreign currency forward contracts are utilized as economic hedges and changes in the fair value of these contracts are recorded currently in earnings in the period in which they occur. Cash 76 Table of Contents receipts or payments related to the settlement of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded as investing cash flows within the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Additional information pertaining to foreign currency forward contracts and net investment hedging is included in “Note 14: Financial Instruments.” Environmental. Environmental investigatory, remediation, operating and maintenance costs are accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site, including existing technology, current laws and regulations and prior remediation experience. Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, the minimum is accrued. For sites with multiple responsible parties, we consider our likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation costs and the ability of the other parties to fulfill their obligations in establishing a provision for those costs. Liabilities with fixed or reliably determinable future cash payments are discounted. A portion of these costs is eligible for future recovery through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government. We regularly assess the probability of recovery of these costs, which requires us to make assumptions about the extent of cost recovery under our contracts and the amount of future contract activity with the U.S. government. We consider such recovery probable based on government contracting regulations and our history of receiving reimbursement for such costs, and accordingly have recorded the future recovery of these costs from the U.S. government within Other assets, current in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Accrued environmental liabilities are not reduced by potential insurance reimbursements or potential recoveries from pursuing other parties. We also lease certain government-owned properties and generally are not liable for remediation of preexisting environmental contamination at these sites. As a result, we generally do not provide for these costs in our Consolidated Financial Statements. See “Note 18: Commitments and Contingencies” for additional details on the environmental remediation activities. Pension and Postretirement Obligations. U.S. GAAP requires balance sheet recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of pension and postretirement benefit (PRB) plans. Funded status is measured at least annually in the fourth quarter and represents the difference between the plans’ projected benefit obligation (PBO) and the fair market value of the plans’ assets. Changes to our pension and PRB plans’ funded status can result from company actions, such as contributions or changes in plan provisions, or by gains and losses. Gains and losses are primarily a result of changes in assumptions and actual experience that differs from these assumptions. Major assumptions include the discount rate and expected return on plan assets (EROA). These gains or losses are recorded in other comprehensive income, net of tax effects, until they are amortized as a component of net periodic benefit (income) expense. A calculated “market-related value” of our plan assets is used to develop the amount of deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized. The market-related value of assets is equal to the fair value of assets adjusted to reflect the recognition, and subsequent amortization, of the difference between actual and expected asset returns over a five-year period. The market-related value of assets is used to calculate the expected return on assets included in the net periodic benefit (income) expense. The Company has elected to use the “corridor” approach in the amortization of gains and losses, which limits the expense recognition to the net outstanding gains and losses in excess of the greater of 10% of the PBO or 10% of the market-related value of assets. Gains and losses exceeding the corridor are amortized in net periodic benefit (income) expense over either the projected average remaining employee service period or the projected average remaining lifetime of inactive participants depending on the plan. Net periodic benefit (income) expense is classified between operating and non-operating, whereby only the service cost component is included in operating profit and the remaining components are included in Non-service pension (income) expense. Product Performance Obligations. We extend performance and operating cost guarantees beyond our normal service and warranty policies for extended periods on some of our products, particularly commercial aircraft engines. Liability under such guarantees is based upon future product performance and durability. We accrue for such costs that are probable and can be reasonably estimated. In addition, we incur discretionary costs to service our products in connection with product performance issues. The costs associated with these product performance and operating cost guarantees require estimates over the full terms of the agreements, and require management to consider factors such as the extent of future maintenance requirements, interval between flight and repair time and the future cost of material and labor to perform the services. These cost estimates are largely based upon historical experience. See “Note 17: Guarantees” for further discussion. Government Grants. We may receive grants from various federal, state, local, and foreign governments in exchange for compliance with certain conditions relating to our activities in a specific jurisdiction. Grants are often structured to encourage investment, job creation, job retention, employee training, and other related activities. We recognize government grants when there is reasonable assurance that the Company will comply with the conditions of the grant and the grant is received or is probable of receipt and the amount is determinable. Government grants are recorded as a reduction to the related expense or 77 Table of Contents asset to which the grant relates or recorded in Other income, net in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Government grant transactions are not material to our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Accounting Pronouncements. In September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2022-04, Liabilities – Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations, which requires that a buyer in a supplier finance program disclose the key terms of supplier finance programs, the amount of obligations outstanding at the end of the reporting period that the entity has confirmed as valid to the finance provider, where these obligations are recorded in the balance sheet, and a roll forward of the obligations. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, on a retrospective basis, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new pronouncement. In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance, which requires business entities to make specific annual disclosures about transactions with a government. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. The adoption of this standard did not have an impact on our disclosures. In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, which requires an acquirer to apply the guidance in ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business combination, rather than using fair value. The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. Effective January 1, 2022, we elected to early adopt the requirements of the new standard on a prospective basis. The adoption of the standard did not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Other new pronouncements issued but not effective until after December 31, 2022 are not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. NOTE 2: BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS, GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS Business Acquisitions. Our investments in businesses, net of cash acquired, in 2022, 2021 and 2020 totaled $ 66 million, $ 1.1 billion and $ 35.1 billion, respectively. Our investments in business in 2022 consisted of immaterial acquisitions. Our investments in business in 2021 and 2020 primarily consisted of the acquisitions discussed below. In November 2021, we completed the acquisitions of FlightAware and SEAKR Engineering Inc., for a total of approximately $ 1.1 billion, net of cash received. FlightAware is a leading digital aviation company providing global flight tracking solutions, predictive technology, analytics and decision-making tools, and is reported in the Collins segment. SEAKR Engineering Inc. is a leading supplier of advanced space electronics and is reported in the RIS segment. In connection with these acquisitions, we recorded $ 0.8 billion of goodwill and $ 0.3 billion of intangible assets. In December 2020, we completed the acquisition of Blue Canyon Technologies, a leading provider of small satellites and spacecraft systems components for $ 425 million, net of cash received. Blue Canyon Technologies is reported in the RIS segment. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded $ 281 million of goodwill and $ 149 million of intangible assets. Pro forma financial information and revenue from the date of acquisition have not been provided for these acquisitions as they are not material either individually or in the aggregate. Raytheon Merger. As discussed in “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles”, on April 3, 2020, UTC and Raytheon Company completed an all-stock merger of equals, following the completion by UTC of the Separation Transactions and Distributions. Raytheon Company (previously New York Stock Exchange (NYSE): RTN) shares ceased trading prior to the market open on April 3, 2020, and each share of Raytheon common stock was converted in the merger into the right to receive 2.3348 shares of UTC common stock, previously traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “UTX.” Upon closing of the Raytheon merger, UTC’s name was changed to “Raytheon Technologies Corporation,” and its shares of common stock began trading as of April 3, 2020 on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “RTX.” Total consideration is calculated as follows: (dollars in millions) Amount Fair value of RTC common stock issued for Raytheon Company outstanding common stock and vested equity awards $ 33,067 Fair value attributable to pre-merger service for replacement equity awards 99 Total merger consideration $ 33,166 78 Table of Contents The fair value of RTC common stock issued for Raytheon Company outstanding common stock and vested equity awards is calculated as follows: (dollars and shares in millions, except per share amounts and exchange ratio) Amount Number of Raytheon Company common shares outstanding as of April 3, 2020 277.3 Number of Raytheon Company stock awards vested as a result of the Raytheon merger (1) 0.4 Total outstanding shares of Raytheon Company common stock and equity awards entitled to merger consideration 277.7 Exchange ratio (2) 2.3348 Shares of RTC common stock issued for Raytheon Company outstanding common stock and vested equity awards 648.4 Price per share of RTC common stock (3) $ 51.00 Fair value of RTC common stock issued for Raytheon Company outstanding common stock and vested equity awards $ 33,067 (1) Represents Raytheon Company stock awards that vested as a result of the Raytheon merger, which is considered a “change in control” for purposes of the Raytheon 2010 Stock Plan. Certain Raytheon Company restricted stock awards and Raytheon Company restricted stock unit (RSU) awards, issued under the Raytheon 2010 Stock Plan vested on an accelerated basis as a result of the Raytheon merger. Such vested awards were converted into the right to receive RTC common stock determined as the product of (1) the number of vested awards, and (2) the exchange ratio. (2) The exchange ratio is equal to 2.3348 shares of UTC common stock for each share of Raytheon Company common stock in accordance with the Raytheon merger agreement. (3) The price per share of RTC common stock is based on the RTC opening stock price as of April 3, 2020. Allocation of Consideration Transferred to Net Assets Acquired. We accounted for the Raytheon merger under the acquisition method and are required to measure identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed of the acquiree (Raytheon Company) at the fair values on the closing date. During the first quarter of 2021, based on the finalization of our valuation and internal reviews, we completed the purchase price allocation which resulted in a net increase to goodwill of $ 61 million. The final purchase price allocation, net of cash acquired, for the acquisition was as follows: (dollars in millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,208 Accounts receivable 1,997 Contract assets 6,023 Inventory 705 Other assets, current 940 Fixed assets 4,745 Operating lease right-of-use assets 950 Intangible assets 19,130 Other assets 1,218 Total identifiable assets acquired 38,916 Accounts payable 1,477 Accrued employee compensation 1,492 Other accrued liabilities 1,921 Contract liabilities 3,002 Long-term debt, including current portion 4,700 Operating lease liabilities, non-current 738 Future pension and postretirement benefit obligations 11,607 Other long-term liabilities 2,368 Total liabilities acquired 27,305 Total identifiable net assets 11,611 Goodwill 21,589 Redeemable noncontrolling interest ( 34 ) Total consideration transferred $ 33,166 Fair value adjustments to Raytheon Company’s identified assets and liabilities included an increase in fixed assets of 79 Table of Contents $ 1.1 billion and an increase to future pension and postretirement benefit obligations of $ 3.6 billion, primarily related to remeasurement of the liability based on market conditions on the Raytheon merger closing date. In determining the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, a review was conducted for any significant contingent assets or liabilities existing as of the closing date. The assessment did not note any material contingencies related to existing legal or government action. The Separation Transactions included the transfer of certain defined benefit plans from UTC to Carrier and Otis. The plans transferred were primarily international plans with the majority of the UTC defined benefit liability remaining with Raytheon Technologies. Upon separation, the pension participants within Carrier and Otis were effectively terminated from Raytheon Technologies. The terminations triggered a mid-year remeasurement of the UTC domestic plans. The remeasurement, which was calculated using discount rates and asset values as of April 3, 2020 (using March 31, 2020 as a practical expedient), resulted in a $ 2.4 billion increase to our pension liability, primarily due to a decrease in the fair market value of the plans’ assets since December 31, 2019. All service cost previously associated with Carrier and Otis was reclassified to discontinued operations. For non-service pension (income) expense and pension liabilities, generally only the portions related to the defined benefit plans transferred to Carrier and Otis as part of the Separation Transactions were reclassified to discontinued operations. The fair values of the customer relationship intangible assets were determined by using a discounted cash flow valuation method, which is a form of the income approach. Under this approach, the estimated future cash flows attributable to the asset are adjusted to exclude the future cash flows that can be attributed to supporting assets, such as tradenames or fixed assets. Both the amount and the duration of the cash flows are considered from a market participant perspective. Our estimates of market participant future cash flows, which required significant management judgment, included forecasted revenue growth rates, remaining developmental effort, operational performance including company specific synergies, program life cycles, material and labor pricing, and other relevant customer, contractual and market factors. Where appropriate, the net cash flows were probability-adjusted to reflect the uncertainties associated with the underlying assumptions, including cancellation rates related to backlog, government demand for sole-source and recompete contracts and win rates for recompete contracts, as well as the risk profile of the net cash flows utilized in the valuation. The probability-adjusted future cash flows were then discounted to present value, using an appropriate discount rate that required significant judgment by management. The customer relationship intangible assets are being amortized based on the pattern of economic benefits we expect to realize over the estimated economic life of the underlying programs. The fair value of the tradename intangible assets were determined utilizing the relief from royalty method, which is a form of the income approach. Under this method, a royalty rate based on observed market royalties is applied to projected revenue supporting the tradename and discounted to present value, using forecasted revenue growth rate projections and a discount rate, respectively, that required significant judgment by management. The tradename intangible assets were determined to have an indefinite life. The developed technology intangible assets are being amortized based on the pattern of economic benefits. The intangible assets included above consist of the following: (dollars in millions) Fair Value Useful Life Acquired customer relationships $ 12,900 25 years Acquired tradenames 5,430 Indefinite Acquired developed technology 800 5 to 7 years Total identifiable intangible assets $ 19,130 We also identified customer contractual obligations on loss making programs and recorded liabilities of $ 222 million related to these programs based on the difference between the actual expected operating loss and a normalized operating profit. These liabilities are being liquidated based on the expected pattern of expenses incurred on these contracts. We recorded $ 21.6 billion of goodwill as a result of the Raytheon merger which primarily relates to expected synergies from combining operations and the value of the existing workforce. The goodwill generated as a result of the Raytheon merger is nondeductible for tax purposes. Merger-Related Costs. Merger-related costs have been expensed as incurred. In 2021 and 2020, we recorded $ 17 million and $ 142 million, respectively, of Raytheon merger transaction and integration costs. These costs were recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Supplemental Pro-Forma Data. Raytheon Company’s results of operations have been included in RTC’s financial statements for the period subsequent to the completion of the Raytheon merger on April 3, 2020. The following unaudited supplemental pro-forma data presents consolidated information as if the Raytheon merger had been completed on January 1, 2019. The pro-forma results were calculated by combining the results of Raytheon Technologies with the stand-alone results of Raytheon Company for the pre-acquisition periods, which were adjusted to account for certain costs that would have been incurred during 80 Table of Contents this pre-acquisition period. The results below reflect Raytheon Technologies on a continuing operations basis, in order to more accurately represent the structure of Raytheon Technologies after completion of the Separation Transactions, the Distributions and the Raytheon merger. (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2020 Net sales $ 64,087 Loss from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners ( 2,167 ) Basic loss per share of common stock from continuing operations $ ( 1.43 ) Diluted loss per share of common stock from continuing operations ( 1.43 ) The unaudited supplemental pro-forma data above includes the following significant adjustments made to account for certain costs which would have been incurred if the acquisition had been completed on January 1, 2019, as adjusted for the applicable tax impact. As the merger was completed on April 3, 2020, the pro-forma adjustments in the table below only include the required adjustments through April 3, 2020. (dollars in millions) 2020 Amortization of acquired Raytheon Company intangible assets, net (1) $ ( 270 ) Amortization of fixed asset fair value adjustment (2) ( 9 ) Utilization of contractual customer obligation (3) 8 Deferred revenue fair value adjustment (4) ( 4 ) Adjustment to non-service pension (income) expense (5) 239 RTC/Raytheon fees for advisory, legal, accounting services (6) 134 Adjustment to interest expense related to the Raytheon merger, net (7) 9 Elimination of deferred commission amortization (8) 5 $ 112 (1) Reflects the additional amortization of the acquired Raytheon Company’s intangible assets recognized at fair value in purchase accounting and eliminates the historical Raytheon Company intangible asset amortization expense. (2) Reflects the amortization of the fixed asset fair value adjustment as of the acquisition date. (3) Reflects the additional amortization of liabilities recognized for certain acquired loss making contracts as of the acquisition date. (4) Reflects the difference between prepayments related to extended arrangements and the fair value of the assumed performance obligations as they are satisfied. (5) Represents the elimination of unamortized prior service costs and actuarial losses, as a result of fair value purchase accounting. (6) Reflects the elimination of transaction-related fees incurred by RTC and Raytheon Company in connection with the Raytheon merger and assumes all of the fees were incurred during the first quarter of 2019. (7) Reflects the amortization of the fair market value adjustment related to Raytheon Company. (8) Reflects the elimination of amortization recognized on deferred commissions that are eliminated in purchase accounting. The unaudited supplemental pro-forma financial information does not reflect the potential realization of cost savings related to the integration of the two companies. Further, the pro-forma data should not be considered indicative of the results that would have occurred if the acquisition had been consummated on January 1, 2019, nor are they indicative of future results. Dispositions. In 2022, 2021 and 2020 cash inflows related to dispositions were $ 94 million, $ 1.9 billion and $ 2.6 billion, respectively. Our dispositions of businesses in 2022 were immaterial. Our dispositions of businesses in 2021 and 2020 consisted of the dispositions discussed below and other immaterial dispositions. In December 2021, we divested our global training and services business within our RIS segment for approximately $ 0.9 billion in cash and other consideration, resulting in an aggregate pre-tax gain, net of transaction costs, of $ 251 million ($ 135 million after tax), which includes a $ 12 million pre-tax gain recognized in Non-service pension income within the Consolidated Statement of Operations. In January 2021, we sold our Forcepoint business for proceeds of $ 1.1 billion, net of cash transferred. We did not recognize a pre-tax gain or loss within the Consolidated Statement of Operations related to the sale of Forcepoint. The results of Forcepoint were included in Eliminations and other in our segment results. In the third quarter of 2020, in accordance with conditions imposed for regulatory approval of the Raytheon merger, we completed the sale of our Collins military Global Positioning System (GPS) and space-based precision optics businesses for $ 2.3 billion in cash, resulting in an aggregate pre-tax gain, net of transaction costs, of $ 580 million ($ 253 million after tax), of which $ 608 million was included in Other income, net partially offset by $ 20 million of aggregate transaction costs included in 81 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative costs and an $ 8 million expense included in Non-service pension income within our Consolidated Statement of Operations. In May 2020, in order to meet the requirements for regulatory approval of the Raytheon merger, we completed the sale of our airborne tactical radios business within our RIS segment for $ 231 million in cash, net of transaction-related costs. As the transaction occurred subsequent to the Raytheon merger, the gain of $ 199 million was not recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Operations, but rather was recorded as an adjustment to the fair value of net assets acquired in the allocation of consideration transferred to net assets acquired in the Raytheon merger. Goodwill. Changes in our goodwill balances for the year ended in 2022 were as follows: (dollars in millions) Balance as of January 1, 2022 Acquisitions and Divestitures Foreign currency translation and other Balance as of December 31, 2022 Collins Aerospace $ 31,384 $ ( 36 ) $ ( 629 ) $ 30,719 Pratt & Whitney 1,563 — — 1,563 Raytheon Intelligence & Space 9,813 26 2 9,841 Raytheon Missiles & Defense 11,659 41 — 11,700 Total Segment 54,419 31 ( 627 ) 53,823 Eliminations and other 17 — — 17 Total $ 54,436 $ 31 $ ( 627 ) $ 53,840 The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired. We completed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of October 1, 2022 and determined that no adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill were necessary. For those reporting units where we performed a quantitative test, we estimated the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of discounted cash flows and market-based valuation methodologies. As noted above, these methodologies involve significant assumptions that are subject to variability. The key assumptions used in our quantitative analysis include our business projections, including revenue growth rates and operating profit margins, the long-term growth rate used to calculate the terminal value of the reporting unit, the discount rate, and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry. We consider both internal and external factors and refresh key assumptions annually or as considered necessary. Material changes in these estimates could occur and result in impairments in future periods. Based on our annual impairment analysis as of October 1, 2022, the reporting units that were closest to impairment were two previously combined Collins reporting units with fair values in excess of book values, including goodwill, of 15 % and 17 %. The combined value of goodwill allocated to these two reporting units is approximately $ 9.5 billion as of the date testing was performed. All other reporting units had a fair value substantially in excess of book value. We considered the deterioration in general economic and market conditions primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic to be a triggering event in the first and second quarters of 2020, requiring an impairment evaluation of goodwill, intangible assets, net and other assets in our commercial aerospace businesses, Collins and Pratt & Whitney. Beginning in the second quarter of 2020, we observed several airline customer bankruptcies, delays and cancellations of aircraft purchases by airlines, fleet retirements and repositioning of OEM production schedules and we experienced significant unfavorable EAC adjustments at our Collins and Pratt & Whitney businesses due to a decline in flight hours, aircraft fleet utilization, shop visits and commercial OEM deliveries. These factors contributed to a deterioration of our expectations regarding the timing of a return to pre-COVID-19 commercial flight activity, which further reduced our future sales and cash flows expectations. In the second quarter of 2020, we evaluated the Collins and Pratt & Whitney reporting units for goodwill impairment and determined that the carrying values of two of the six Collins reporting units exceeded the sum of discounted future cash flows, resulting in goodwill impairments of $ 3.2 billion. Goodwill impairment was not indicated for any of the other reporting units evaluated for impairment in any of these scenarios. The Company continuously monitors and evaluates relevant events and circumstances that could unfavorably impact the significant assumptions noted above, including changes to U.S. treasury rates and equity risk premiums, tax rates, recent market valuations from transactions by comparable companies, volatility in the Company’s market capitalization, and general industry, market and macro-economic conditions. It is possible that future changes in such circumstances or in the inputs and assumptions used in estimating the fair value of our reporting units, could require the Company to record a non-cash impairment charge. 82 Table of Contents Intangible Assets. Identifiable intangible assets are comprised of the following: 2022 2021 (dollars in millions) Gross Amount Accumulated Amortization Gross Amount Accumulated Amortization Amortized: Collaboration assets $ 5,536 $ ( 1,408 ) $ 5,319 $ ( 1,173 ) Exclusivity assets 2,911 ( 323 ) 2,673 ( 318 ) Developed technology and other 1,202 ( 544 ) 1,214 ( 466 ) Customer relationships 29,775 ( 8,967 ) 29,982 ( 7,411 ) 39,424 ( 11,242 ) 39,188 ( 9,368 ) Indefinite-lived: Trademarks and other 8,641 — 8,696 — Total $ 48,065 $ ( 11,242 ) $ 47,884 $ ( 9,368 ) We also completed our annual indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment testing as of October 1, 2022 and determined that no adjustments to the carrying value of these assets were necessary. In 2020, given the deterioration in general economic and market conditions primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we performed an assessment of our indefinite-lived intangible assets and recorded charges of $ 57 million related to the impairment of an indefinite-lived tradename intangible assets at Collins. Amortization of intangible assets was $ 1,957 million, $ 2,439 million and $ 2,125 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The following is the expected amortization of total intangible assets for 2023 through 2027: (dollars in millions) 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Amortization expense $ 2,082 $ 2,203 $ 2,086 $ 2,002 $ 1,882 NOTE 3: DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS As discussed above, on April 3, 2020, UTC separated into three independent, publicly traded companies – UTC, Carrier and Otis and distributed all of the outstanding common stock of Carrier and Otis to UTC shareowners who held shares of U TC common stock as of the close of business on March 19, 2020. Carrier and Otis are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Loss from discontinued operations is as follows: (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Otis $ — $ — $ 187 Carrier — — 196 Separation related and other discontinued operations transactions ( 19 ) ( 33 ) ( 793 ) Loss from discontinued operations attributable to common shareowners $ ( 19 ) $ ( 33 ) $ ( 410 ) The following summarized financial information related to discontinued operations has been reclassified from Income from continuing operations and included in Income (loss) from discontinued operations: (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Otis Products sales $ — $ — $ 1,123 Services sales — — 1,843 Cost of sales - products — — 913 Cost of sales - services — — 1,157 Research and development — — 38 Selling, general and administrative expense — — 450 Other income (expense), net — — ( 65 ) 83 Table of Contents Non-operating expense (income), net — — 3 Income from discontinued operations, before income taxes — — 340 Income tax expense — — 116 Income from discontinued operations — — 224 Less: Noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries earnings from discontinued operations — — 37 Income from discontinued operations attributable to common shareowners $ — $ — $ 187 Carrier Products sales $ — $ — $ 3,143 Services sales — — 741 Cost of sales - products — — 2,239 Cost of sales - services — — 527 Research and development — — 98 Selling, general and administrative expense — — 669 Other income (expense), net — — ( 30 ) Non-operating expense (income), net — — 17 Income from discontinued operations, before income taxes — — 304 Income tax expense — — 102 Income from discontinued operations — — 202 Less: Noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries earnings from discontinued operations — — 6 Income from discontinued operations attributable to common shareowners $ — $ — $ 196 Separation related and other discontinued operations transactions (1) Selling, general and administrative expense $ — $ 10 $ 151 Other income (expense), net ( 30 ) — ( 709 ) Loss from discontinued operations, before income taxes ( 30 ) ( 10 ) ( 860 ) Income tax (benefit) expense ( 11 ) 23 ( 67 ) Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax ( 19 ) ( 33 ) ( 793 ) Total loss from discontinued operations attributable to common shareowners $ ( 19 ) $ ( 33 ) $ ( 410 ) (1) Primarily reflects unallocable transaction costs incurred by the Company primarily related to professional services costs pertaining to the Separation Transactions and the establishment of Carrier and Otis as stand-alone public companies, facility relocation costs, costs to separate information systems, costs of retention bonuses and tax charges and benefits related to separation activities. In addition, 2020 includes debt extinguishment costs related to the Company’s paydown of debt to not exceed the maximum applicable net indebtedness under the Raytheon merger agreement. Selected financial information related to cash flows from discontinued operations is as follows: (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Net cash flows used in operating activities from discontinued operations $ — $ ( 71 ) $ ( 728 ) Net cash flows used in investing activities from discontinued operations — — ( 241 ) Net cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities from discontinued operations — 71 ( 1,414 ) Net cash flows used in operating activities from discontinued operations includes the net operating cash flows of Carrier and Otis prior to the Separation Transactions, as well as costs incurred by the Company primarily related to professional services pertaining to the Separation Transactions and the establishment of Carrier and Otis as stand-alone public companies, facility relocation costs, costs to separate information systems, costs of retention bonuses and tax charges related to separation activities. Net cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities from discontinued operations primarily consists of net cash transfers from Carrier and Otis to the Company, as well as debt extinguishment costs related to the early repayment of debt in 2020. The Separation of Carrier was treated as a return on capital and recorded as a reduction to retained earnings, as it was in a net asset position, while the Separation of Otis was treated as a return of capital and recorded as an adjustment to Common stock, as it was in a net liability position. 84 Table of Contents NOTE 4: EARNINGS PER SHARE (dollars in millions, except per share amounts; shares in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Net income (loss) attributable to common shareowners: Income (loss) from continuing operations $ 5,216 $ 3,897 $ ( 3,109 ) Loss from discontinued operations ( 19 ) ( 33 ) ( 410 ) Net income (loss) attributable to common shareowners $ 5,197 $ 3,864 $ ( 3,519 ) Basic weighted average number of shares outstanding 1,475.5 1,501.6 1,357.8 Stock awards and equity units (share equivalent) 10.4 6.9 — Diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding 1,485.9 1,508.5 1,357.8 Earnings (Loss) per share attributable to common shareowners - basic Income (loss) from continuing operations $ 3.54 $ 2.60 $ ( 2.29 ) Loss from discontinued operations ( 0.02 ) ( 0.03 ) ( 0.30 ) Net income (loss) attributable to common shareowners $ 3.52 $ 2.57 $ ( 2.59 ) Earnings (Loss) per share attributable to common shareowners - diluted Income (loss) from continuing operations $ 3.51 $ 2.58 $ ( 2.29 ) Loss from discontinued operations ( 0.01 ) ( 0.02 ) ( 0.30 ) Net income (loss) attributable to common shareowners $ 3.50 $ 2.56 $ ( 2.59 ) The computation of diluted EPS excludes the effect of the potential exercise of stock awards, including stock appreciation rights and stock options, when the average market price of the common stock is lower than the exercise price of the related stock awards during the period because the effect would be anti-dilutive. In addition, the computation of diluted EPS excludes the effect of the potential exercise of stock awards when the awards’ assumed proceeds exceed the average market price of the common shares during the period. For 2022 and 2021, there were 6.2 million and 13.4 million stock awards excluded from the computation, respectively. For 2020, all stock awards were excluded from the computation of diluted EPS because their effect was antidilutive due to the loss from continuing operations, and amounted to 32.5 million stock awards. NOTE 5: ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET Accounts receivable, net consisted of the following: (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 U.S. government contracts (including foreign military sales) $ 1,371 $ 1,204 Other customers 8,189 8,932 Allowance for expected credit losses ( 452 ) ( 475 ) Total accounts receivable, net $ 9,108 $ 9,661 The changes in the allowance for expected credit losses related to Accounts receivable were as follows: (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Balance as of January 1 $ 475 $ 546 Current period provision for expected credit losses, net of recoveries 26 ( 47 ) Write-offs charged against the allowance for expected credit losses ( 42 ) ( 18 ) Other, net ( 7 ) ( 6 ) Balance as of December 31 $ 452 $ 475 NOTE 6: CONTRACT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES Contract assets reflect revenue recognized and performance obligations satisfied in advance of customer billing. Contract liabilities relate to payments received in advance of the satisfaction of performance under the contract.

Total contract assets and contract liabilities as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows: (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Contract assets $ 11,534 $ 11,361 Contract liabilities ( 14,598 ) ( 13,720 ) Net contract liabilities $ ( 3,064 ) $ ( 2,359 ) Contract assets increased $ 173 million during 2022 primarily due to sales in excess of billings at Pratt & Whitney, partially offset by contractual billing terms on U.S. government and foreign military sales contracts at RMD. Contract liabilities increased $ 878 million during 2022 primarily due to billings in excess of sales at Pratt & Whitney and RMD. In 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recognized revenue of $ 4.8 billion, $ 4.3 billion and $ 2.8 billion related to our Contract liabilities at January 1, 2022, January 1, 2021 and January 1, 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, our Contract liabilities include approximately $ 385 million of advance payments received from a Middle East customer on contracts for which we no longer believe we will be able to execute on or obtain required regulatory approvals. These advance payments may become refundable to the customer if the contracts are ultimately terminated. In addition, as of December 31, 2022, our Contract liabilities include advance payments, in immaterial amounts, received from Russian customers on contracts we are currently unable to perform on due to global sanctions on Russia and export controls. Depending on the contractual terms and as allowed by sanctions, certain of these advance payments may become refundable. Contract assets consisted of the following at December 31: (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Unbilled $ 23,909 $ 23,652 Progress payments ( 12,375 ) ( 12,291 ) Total contract assets $ 11,534 $ 11,361 The U.S. government has title to the assets related to unbilled amounts on U.S. government contracts that provide progress payments. Contract assets are net of an allowance for expected credit losses of $ 318 million and $ 251 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The allowance for expected credit losses activity was not material in 2022 or 2021.

NOTE 8: COMMERCIAL AEROSPACE INDUSTRY ASSETS AND COMMITMENTS The COVID-19 pandemic continues to negatively affect the global economy, our business and operations, and the industries in which we operate. The pandemic and government, business and individual actions in response, including lockdowns, quarantines, border closings and other travel restrictions and requirements, remote working, facilities closures and reduced business and leisure travel, led to significant declines in demand for commercial air travel. The decrease in commercial air travel decreased demand for our commercial aerospace products and services of our Collins and Pratt & Whitney businesses. Refer to “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” for further details. While we have seen indications that commercial air travel is recovering, we continue to closely monitor our commercial aerospace assets for 86 Table of Contents recoverability and our off-balance sheet exposures. The following summarizes certain significant assets and off-balance sheet exposures specifically related to our commercial aerospace customers as of December 31: (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Assets related to commercial aerospace industry customers: Accounts receivable, net (Note 5) $ 6,653 $ 7,235 Contract assets (Note 6) 4,274 3,264 Customer financing assets (1) (Note 1) 2,700 2,945 Contract fulfillment costs (Note 1) 1,962 1,711 Guarantees and commitments related to commercial aerospace industry customers: Commercial aerospace guarantees (net of reserves and collaboration partners’ share) (Note 17) 164 165 Commercial aerospace commitments (net of collaboration partners’ share) (Note 18) 9,364 9,659 (1) Customer financing assets is inclusive of both the current and long term balances. We also have goodwill and intangible assets, including exclusivity assets and collaboration assets, associated with our commercial aerospace business. Refer to “Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets” for further discussion. NOTE 9: FIXED ASSETS, NET Fixed assets, net, consisted of the following: (dollars in millions) Estimated Useful Lives 2022 2021 Land $ 744 $ 765 Buildings and improvements 10 - 45 years 7,519 7,271 Machinery, tools and equipment 3 - 20 years 17,479 16,729 Other, including assets under construction 3,374 2,872 Fixed assets, gross 29,116 27,637 Accumulated depreciation ( 13,946 ) ( 12,665 ) Fixed assets, net $ 15,170 $ 14,972 Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life of the improvement. Depreciation expense related to Fixed assets, net is recorded predominantly utilizing the straight-line method and was $ 1,843 million in 2022, $ 1,828 million in 2021 and $ 1,767 million in 2020. NOTE 10: BORROWINGS AND LINES OF CREDIT As of December 31, 2022, we had revolving credit agreements with various banks permitting aggregate borrowings of up to $ 7.0 billion, consisting of a $ 5.0 billion revolving credit agreement, which expires in April 2025, and a $ 2.0 billion revolving credit agreement, which was renewed in September 2022 and expires in September 2023. As of December 31, 2022, there were no borrowings outstanding under these agreements. In addition, at December 31, 2022, approximately $ 0.8 billion was available under short-term lines of credit with local banks at our various domestic and international subsidiaries. From time to time, we use commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes, including the funding of potential acquisitions, pension contributions, debt refinancing, dividend payments and repurchases of our common stock. The commercial paper notes have original maturities of not more than 364 days from the date of issuance. As of December 31, 2022, our maximum commercial paper borrowing limit was $ 5.0 billion as the commercial paper is backed by our $ 5.0 billion revolving credit agreement. We had $ 524 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2022, which is reflected in Short-term borrowings in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. At December 31, 2022, short-term commercial paper borrowings outstanding had a weighted-average interest rate of 4.4 %. There was no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2021. Proceeds from issuance of commercial paper with maturities greater than 90 days were $ 1.4 billion during 2022. There were $ 1.2 billion repayments of commercial paper with maturities greater than 90 days during 2022. During 2021, we had no commercial paper borrowings with original maturities more than 90 days from the date of issuance. 87 Table of Contents On November 17, 2021, we completed a cash tender offer for the notes included in the repayments table below (the Tender Offer Notes), resulting in a partial repayment of approximately $ 1.5 billion of aggregate principal on these notes. In connection with this transaction, we recorded debt extinguishment costs of $ 617 million, primarily related to premiums. We had de minimis issuances and repayments of long-term debt during 2022.

Employee Savings Plans. We sponsor various employee savings plans. Our contributions to employer sponsored defined contribution plans were $ 1,037 million, $ 962 million and $ 875 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our non-union domestic employee savings plan for legacy UTC employees uses an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) for employer matching contributions. External borrowings were used by the ESOP to fund a portion of its purchase of ESOP stock from us. The external borrowings have been extinguished and only re-amortized loans remain between RTC and the ESOP Trust. As ESOP debt service payments are made, common stock is released from an unreleased shares account. ESOP debt may be prepaid or re-amortized to either increase or decrease the number of shares released so that the value of released shares equals the value of plan benefit. We may also, at our option, contribute additional common stock or cash to the ESOP. Shares of common stock are allocated to employees’ ESOP accounts at fair value on the date earned. Cash dividends on common stock held by the ESOP are used for debt service payments. Participants may choose to have their ESOP dividends reinvested or distributed in cash. Common stock allocated to ESOP participants is included in the average number of common shares outstanding for both basic and diluted EPS. At December 31, 2022, 24.7 million common shares had been allocated to employees, leaving 5.1 million unallocated common shares in the ESOP Trust, with a fair value of $ 512 million. Pension and Postretirement Plans. We sponsor both funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension plans that cover a large number of our employees. Our largest plans are generally closed to new participants. We also sponsor both funded and unfunded PRB plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits to eligible retirees. Our plans use a December 31 measurement date consistent with our fiscal year. Raytheon Company has both funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and PRB plans. As of the merger date, the Raytheon Company plans were remeasured at fair value using accounting policies consistent with the UTC plans. Refer to “Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets” for additional information. The deferred pension and PRB plan losses included in Raytheon Company’s accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of the merger date were eliminated and are no longer subject to amortization in net periodic benefit (income) expense. Amounts prior to the merger date of April 3, 2020 do not include the Raytheon Company pension plan results. In December 2020, we approved a change to the Raytheon Company domestic benefit pension plans for non-union participants to cease future benefit accruals based on an employee’s years of service and compensation under the historical formula effective December 31, 2022. The plan change does not impact participants’ historical benefit accruals. Benefits for service after December 31, 2022 will be based on a cash balance formula. We utilized a practical expedient and measured the plan assets and pension benefit obligations for the effected pension plans as of the nearest month end, December 31, 2020, resulting in a prior service credit of $ 2.1 billion. For non-union employees in the UTC domestic pension plans, benefits for service up to December 31, 2014 are generally based on the employee’s years of service and compensation. Benefits for service after December 31, 2014 and through December 31, 2019 are based on the existing cash balance formula that was adopted in 2003 for newly hired non-union employees and for non-union employees who made a one-time voluntary election to have future benefit accruals determined under this formula. In September 2019, we amended the UTC domestic defined benefit pension plans to cease accrual of additional benefits for future service and compensation for non-union participants effective December 31, 2019. Beginning January 1, 2020, these participants began receiving additional contributions under the UTC domestic defined contribution 90 Table of Contents plan. Benefits for union employees in the UTC domestic pension plans are generally based on a stated amount for each year of service. We made the following contributions to our pension and PRB plans’ trusts during the years ended December 31: (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 U.S. qualified defined benefit plans $ — $ — $ 885 International defined benefit plans 69 42 125 PRB plans 25 17 15 The contributions to our U.S. qualified defined benefit plans in 2020 include a $ 750 million discretionary contribution to the Raytheon Company U.S. qualified pension plans’ trust.

International plans comprise 10 % and 11 % of the pension PBO as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are considered defined benefit pension plans for accounting purposes. In addition to the pension and PRB noncurrent liabilities shown above, Future pension and postretirement benefit obligations on the Consolidated Balance Sheet includes other immaterial pension and PRB-related liabilities.

The Actuarial gain arising in 2022 was primarily due to an increase in discount rates during 2022, partially offset by actual asset returns less than our expected return on assets. The Actuarial gain arising in 2021 was primarily due to an increase in discount rates during 2021 and asset returns exceeding our expected return on assets, partially offset by demographic losses. Other changes in PRB assets and benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive loss in 2022 and 2021 are as follows: (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Net actuarial gain arising during the period $ ( 209 ) $ ( 88 ) Amortization of actuarial gain 11 6 Amortization of prior service credit 2 3 Net settlement and curtailment 3 — Total recognized in other comprehensive (income) loss ( 193 ) ( 79 ) Net recognized in net periodic benefit (income) cost and other comprehensive loss $ ( 196 ) $ ( 78 ) The Actuarial gain arising in 2022 was primarily due to an increase in discount rates during 2022, partially offset by actual asset returns less than our expected return on assets on our funded plans.

The PBO discount rate is used for the service cost and interest cost measurements for non-significant plans. Major assumptions used in determining the PRB benefit obligation and net periodic PRB (income) expense are presented in the following table as weighted-averages: Benefit Obligation Net Periodic Benefit (Income) Expense 2022 2021 2022 2021 2020 Discount rate 5.5 % 2.8 % 2.8 % 2.4 % 3.1 % Expected return on assets N/A N/A 5.7 % 5.7 % 5.7 % Assumed health care cost trend rates used in determining the PRB benefit obligation and net periodic PRB (income) expense are as follows: 2022 2021 Health care cost trend rate assumed for next year 5.0 % 4.7 % Ultimate health care cost trend rate 4.2 % 4.2 % Year that the rate reaches the ultimate health care cost trend rate 2029 2026 The weighted-average discount rates used to measure pension and PRB liabilities are based on yield curves developed using high-quality corporate bonds as well as plan specific expected cash flows. For our significant plans, we utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit expense by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant discounted projected cash flows. In determining the EROA assumption, we consider the target asset allocation of plan assets, as well as economic and other indicators of future performance. We consult with and consider the opinions of financial and other professionals in determining the appropriate capital market assumptions. Return projections are validated using a simulation model that incorporates yield curves, credit spreads and risk premiums to project long-term prospective returns. As a result of this analysis at year end 2022, our weighted average pension EROA assumption for 2023 increased to 7.1 %. Plan Assets. The plans’ investment management objectives include providing the liquidity and asset levels needed to meet current and future benefit payments, while maintaining a prudent degree of portfolio diversification considering interest rate risk and market volatility. Globally, investment strategies generally target a mix of 40 % to 45 % of growth seeking assets and 55 % to 60 % of income generating and hedging assets using a wide set of diversified asset types, fund strategies and investment managers. The growth seeking allocation consists of global public equities in developed and emerging countries, private equity, real estate and multi-asset class strategies. Growth assets include an enhanced alpha strategy that invests in publicly traded equity and fixed income securities, derivatives and foreign currency. Investments in private equity are primarily via limited partnership interests in buy-out strategies with smaller allocations to distressed debt funds. The real estate strategy is principally concentrated in directly held U.S. core investments with some smaller investments in international, value-added and opportunistic strategies. Within the income generating assets, the fixed income portfolio consists of mainly government and broadly diversified high quality corporate bonds. The plans have continued their pension risk management techniques designed to reduce their interest rate risk. Specifically, the plans have incorporated liability hedging programs that include the adoption of a risk reduction objective as part of the long-term investment strategy. Under this objective the interest rate hedge is intended to increase as funded status improves. The 94 Table of Contents hedging programs incorporate a range of assets and investment tools, each with varying interest rate sensitivities. The investment portfolios are currently hedging approximately 40 % to 80 % of the interest rate sensitivity of the pension plan liabilities, depending on the funded status of the plan. The fair values of pension plan assets at December 31, 2022 and 2021 by asset category are as follows: (dollars in millions) Quoted Prices in Active Markets For Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Not Subject to Leveling (8) Total Asset Category: Public Equities Global Equities $ 6,194 $ 5 $ — $ — $ 6,199 Global Equity Commingled Funds (1) 20 568 — — 588 Enhanced Global Equities (2) ( 53 ) 75 — — 22 Other Public Equities — — — 5,771 5,771 Private Equities (3) — — — 4,068 4,068 Fixed Income Securities Governments 2,526 1,426 — — 3,952 Corporate Bonds 1 12,638 — — 12,639 Structured Products — 57 — — 57 Other Fixed Income — — — 6,975 6,975 Real Estate (4) — — 1,650 1,761 3,411 Other (5) — 84 — 3,071 3,155 Cash & Cash Equivalents (6) — 150 — 164 314 Subtotal $ 8,688 $ 15,003 $ 1,650 $ 21,810 $ 47,151 Other Assets & Liabilities (7) 809 Total at December 31, 2022 $ 47,960 Public Equities Global Equities $ 9,411 $ 6 $ — $ — $ 9,417 Global Equity Commingled Funds (1) 3 929 — — 932 Enhanced Global Equities (2) 46 163 — — 209 Other Public Equities — — — 8,495 8,495 Private Equities (3) — — — 4,490 4,490 Fixed Income Securities Governments 1,933 1,172 — — 3,105 Corporate Bonds 1 18,681 — — 18,682 Structured Products — 25 — — 25 Other Fixed Income — — — 7,367 7,367 Real Estate (4) — — 1,885 1,743 3,628 Other (5) — 91 — 5,351 5,442 Cash & Cash Equivalents (6) — 111 — 220 331 Subtotal $ 11,394 $ 21,178 $ 1,885 $ 27,666 $ 62,123 Other Assets & Liabilities (7) 1,200 Total at December 31, 2021 $ 63,323 (1) Represents commingled funds that invest primarily in common stocks.

(8) In accordance with ASU 2015-07, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) , certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented for the total pension benefits plan assets. Derivatives in the plan are primarily used to manage risk and gain asset class exposure while still maintaining liquidity. Derivative instruments mainly consist of equity futures, interest rate futures, interest rate swaps and currency forward contracts. The fair market value of the plans’ derivatives through direct or separate account investments was approximately $( 79 ) million and $ 98 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We review our assets at least quarterly to ensure we are within the targeted asset allocation ranges and, if necessary, asset balances are adjusted back within target allocations. We employ a broadly diversified investment manager structure that includes diversification by active and passive management, style, capitalization, country, sector, industry and number of investment managers. No individual investment represented more than 5 % of the plan assets as of December 31, 2022. The fair value measurement of plan assets using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) changed due to the following: (dollars in millions) Corporate Bonds Real Estate Total Balance, December 31, 2020 $ 2 $ 1,647 $ 1,649 Realized gains — 212 212 Unrealized gains relating to instruments still held in the reporting period — 50 50 Purchases, sales, and settlements, net — ( 24 ) ( 24 ) Transfers in/out, net ( 2 ) — ( 2 ) Balance, December 31, 2021 — 1,885 1,885 Realized gains — 76 76 Unrealized gains relating to instruments still held in the reporting period — 64 64 Purchases, sales, and settlements, net — ( 211 ) ( 211 ) Transfers in/out, net — ( 164 ) ( 164 ) Balance, December 31, 2022 $ — $ 1,650 $ 1,650 Quoted market prices are used to value investments when available. Investments in securities traded on exchanges, including listed futures and options, are valued at the last reported sale prices on the last business day of the year or, if not available, the last reported bid prices. Fixed income securities are primarily measured using a market approach pricing methodology, where observable prices are obtained by market transactions involving identical or comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings. Mortgages have been valued on the basis of their future principal and interest payments discounted at prevailing interest rates for similar investments. Investment contracts are valued at fair value by discounting the related cash flows based on current yields of similar instruments with comparable durations. Real estate investments are valued on a quarterly basis using discounted cash flow models which consider long-term lease estimates, future rental receipts and estimated residual values. Valuation estimates are supplemented by third-party appraisals on an annual basis. The fair market value of assets related to our PRB benefits was $ 302 million and $ 389 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These assets include $ 105 million and $ 147 million of which are invested in our domestic qualified pension plan trust at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The remaining PRB investments are held within Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trusts. The VEBA assets are generally invested in mutual funds and are valued primarily using quoted prices in active markets (Level 1). There were no Level 3 investments in the VEBA trusts as of December 31, 2022 or 2021. We have set aside assets in separate trusts, which we expect to be used to pay for certain nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution plan obligations in excess of qualified plan limits. These assets are included in Other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair value of marketable securities held in trusts as of December 31 was as follows: (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Marketable securities held in trusts $ 774 $ 965 96 Table of Contents NOTE 12: LEASES Operating lease expense was $ 475 million, $ 525 million, and $ 497 million for 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Finance leases and leases where we are the lessor are not considered significant to our Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated Statement of Operations or Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. In 2021 and 2020, we entered into sale and leaseback transactions for the sale of equipment and related maintenance. We subsequently leased back the equipment sold for a limited timeframe, which is accounted for as an operating lease. The proceeds received as a result of the equipment sales are classified in Receipts from customer financing assets within the Investing Activities in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, and the portion related to future maintenance services are classified within Operating Activities. The net gains as a result of these transactions were not material. Supplemental cash flow information related to operating leases were as follows: (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Operating cash flows used in the measurement of operating lease liabilities $ 399 $ 490 $ 420 Operating lease right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for operating lease obligations 359 535 299 Future lease payments related to our operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2022 are as follows: (dollars in millions) 2023 $ 340 2024 301 2025 265 2026 236 2027 195 Thereafter 735 Total undiscounted lease payments 2,072 Less imputed interest ( 130 ) Total discounted lease payments $ 1,942 Our lease liabilities recognized in our Consolidated Balance Sheet were as follows as of December 31: (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Operating lease liabilities, current (included in Other accrued liabilities) $ 356 $ 411 Operating lease liabilities, noncurrent 1,586 1,657 Total operating lease liabilities $ 1,942 $ 2,068 The weighted-average remaining lease term related to our operating leases was 9 years as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. The weighted-average discount rate related to our operating leases was 3.3 % and 2.8 % as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. NOTE 13: INCOME TAXES Income Before Income Taxes. The sources of income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes are: (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 United States $ 4,061 $ 3,498 $ ( 2,762 ) Foreign 1,966 1,433 409 Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes $ 6,027 $ 4,931 $ ( 2,353 ) The Company no longer intends to reinvest certain undistributed earnings of its international subsidiaries that have been previously taxed in the U.S. As such, we recorded the taxes associated with the future remittance of these earnings. For the remainder of the Company’s undistributed international earnings, unless tax effective to repatriate, the Company will continue to permanently reinvest these earnings. As of December 31, 2022, such undistributed earnings were approximately $ 18 billion, excluding other comprehensive income amounts. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable on the remaining amounts. 97 Table of Contents Provision for Income Taxes. The income tax expense (benefit) for the years ended December 31 are as follows: (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Current: United States: Federal $ 1,724 $ 387 $ 324 State 126 60 45 Foreign 513 427 305 2,363 874 674 Future: United States: Federal ( 1,399 ) ( 26 ) ( 264 ) State ( 166 ) 41 258 Foreign ( 98 ) ( 103 ) ( 93 ) ( 1,663 ) ( 88 ) ( 99 ) Income tax expense $ 700 $ 786 $ 575 Reconciliation of Effective Income Tax Rate. Differences between effective income tax rates and the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate are as follows: 2022 2021 2020 (dollars in millions) Amount Rate Amount Rate Amount Rate Statutory U.S. federal income tax rate $ 1,266 21.0 % $ 1,036 21.0 % $ ( 494 ) 21.0 % Tax on international activities ( 186 ) ( 3.1 ) ( 204 ) ( 4.1 ) 27 ( 1.1 ) Tax charges related to Separation Transactions and Raytheon merger — — ( 39 ) ( 0.8 ) 416 ( 17.7 ) Disposals of businesses — — 108 2.2 177 ( 7.5 ) U.S. research and development credit ( 164 ) ( 2.7 ) ( 172 ) ( 3.5 ) ( 142 ) 6.1 Goodwill impairment — — — — 668 ( 28.4 ) State income tax, net ( 12 ) ( 0.2 ) 33 0.7 ( 56 ) 2.4 Foreign Derived Intangible Income ( 214 ) ( 3.5 ) ( 121 ) ( 2.5 ) ( 83 ) 3.5 U.K. corporate tax rate enactment — — 73 1.5 8 ( 0.4 ) Other 10 0.1 72 1.4 54 ( 2.3 ) Effective income tax rate $ 700 11.6 % $ 786 15.9 % $ 575 ( 24.4 ) % The 2022 effective tax rate includes a benefit of $ 214 million related to the Foreign Derived Intangible Income (FDII) benefit, $ 207 million associated with legal entity and operational reorganizations implemented in 2022, and $ 164 million associated with U.S. research and development credits. The increase in the FDII benefit from 2021 is primarily attributable to the capitalization of research or experimental expenditures for tax-purposes, enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 effective beginning January 1, 2022. The 2021 effective tax rate includes tax benefits of $ 244 million included in international activities associated with legal entity and operational reorganizations implemented in 2021, $ 172 million associated with U.S. research and development credits and $ 121 million associated with FDII, and tax charges of $ 73 million associated with the revaluation of deferred taxes resulting from the increase in the U.K. corporate tax rate to 25% enacted in 2021. In the first quarter of 2021, we recorded $ 148 million of tax charges associated with the sale of the Forcepoint business, and subsequently recognized a $ 104 million tax benefit due to the revaluation of that tax benefit as a result of completing the divestiture of RIS’s global training and services business for a gain in the fourth quarter of 2021. 98 Table of Contents The 2020 negative effective tax rate is a result of having tax expense of $ 575 million on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $ 2.4 billion. The loss from continuing operations before income taxes in 2020 includes the $ 3.2 billion goodwill impairment as described in “Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets,” most of which was non-deductible for tax purposes. Tax expense includes net deferred tax charges of $ 416 million resulting from the Separation Transactions and the Raytheon merger primarily related to the impairment of deferred tax assets and the revaluation of certain international tax incentives, and incremental tax expense of $ 177 million related to the disposal of businesses, including the sales of businesses at Collins, the airborne tactical radios business at RIS and the entry into a definitive agreement to sell Forcepoint, as described in “Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets.” Also included in the 2020 effective tax rate are tax benefits of $ 142 million associated with U.S. research and development credits and $ 83 million associated with FDII. Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities. The tax effects of temporary differences and tax carryforwards which gave rise to future income tax benefits and payables at December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows: (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Future income tax benefits: Insurance and employee benefits $ 1,126 $ 1,831 Inventory and contract balances 639 756 Warranty provisions 242 248 Capitalization of research and experimental expenditures 1,712 — Other basis differences 828 878 Tax loss carryforwards 305 251 Tax credit carryforwards 970 1,088 Valuation allowances ( 842 ) ( 825 ) Total future income tax benefits $ 4,980 $ 4,227 Future income taxes payable: Goodwill and intangible assets $ 6,588 $ 7,168 Fixed assets 1,751 1,746 Other basis differences 220 323 Total future income tax payable $ 8,559 $ 9,237 Valuation allowances have been established primarily for tax credit carryforwards, tax loss carryforwards, and certain temporary differences to reduce the future income tax benefits to expected realizable amounts. Tax Credit and Loss Carryforwards. At December 31, 2022, tax credit carryforwards, principally state and foreign, and tax loss carryforwards, principally state and foreign, were as follows: (dollars in millions) Tax Credit Carryforwards Tax Loss Carryforwards Expiration period: 2023-2027 $ 54 $ 292 2028-2032 73 174 2033-2042 337 318 Indefinite 506 1,357 Total $ 970 $ 2,141 99 Table of Contents Unrecognized Tax Benefits. At December 31, 2022, we had gross tax-effected unrecognized tax benefits of $ 1,515 million, of which $ 1,378 million, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits and interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 is as follows: (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Balance at January 1 $ 1,458 $ 1,225 $ 1,347 Additions for tax positions related to the current year 106 110 125 Additions for tax positions of prior years 23 282 323 Reductions for tax positions of prior years ( 56 ) ( 49 ) ( 83 ) Settlements ( 16 ) ( 110 ) ( 48 ) Separation of Carrier and Otis — — ( 439 ) Balance at December 31 $ 1,515 $ 1,458 $ 1,225 Gross interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits $ 34 $ 39 $ 50 Total accrued interest balance at December 31 190 165 141 The unrecognized tax benefit table includes discontinued operations activity in 2020. As a result of the Separation Transactions and the Distributions in April 2020, we transferred unrecognized tax benefits to Carrier and Otis of $ 439 million and associated interest of approximately $ 165 million. Pursuant to the terms of the separation agreements, certain other unrecognized tax benefits retained by the Company are subject to indemnification. The 2020 additions for tax positions of prior years in the table above include amounts related to the Raytheon merger . We conduct business globally and, as a result, Raytheon Technologies or one or more of our subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations for years before 2012. The Examination Division of the IRS is currently auditing Raytheon Technologies tax years 2017 and 2018 and pre-merger Raytheon Company tax years 2017, 2018 and 2019 as well as certain refund claims of Raytheon Company for tax years 2014, 2015 and 2016 filed prior to the Raytheon merger. The examination phase of the audits for each of these tax years is expected to close in 2023. The Examination Division of the IRS is also auditing pre-acquisition Rockwell Collins fiscal tax years 2016, 2017 and 2018. The examination phase of the audit for each of these tax years is expected to close during 2023. It is reasonably possible that a net reduction within the range of $ 25 million to $ 375 million of unrecognized tax benefits may occur over the next 12 months as a result of the revaluation of uncertain tax positions arising from developments in examinations, in appeals, or in the courts, or the closure of tax statutes. NOTE 14: FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS We enter into derivative instruments primarily for risk management purposes, including derivatives designated as hedging instruments and those utilized as economic hedges. We operate internationally and in the normal course of business, are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. These fluctuations can increase the costs of financing, investing and operating the business. We have used derivative instruments, including swaps, forward contracts and options, to manage certain foreign currency, interest rate and commodity price exposures. The present value of aggregate notional principal of our outstanding foreign currency hedges was $ 11.2 billion and $ 8.5 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. At December 31, 2022, all derivative contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges will mature b y February 2030. Additional information pertaining to foreign exchange and hedging activities is included in “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles.” 100 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the fair value and presentation in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for derivative instruments as of December 31: (dollars in millions) Balance Sheet Location 2022 2021 Derivatives designated as hedging instruments: Foreign exchange contracts Other assets, current $ 67 $ 59 Other accrued liabilities 347 202 Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Foreign exchange contracts Other assets, current $ 17 $ 11 Other accrued liabilities 39 11 The effect of cash flow hedging relationships on Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and on the Consolidated Statement of Operations in 2022 and 2021 are presented in “Note 19: Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss”. The amounts of gain or (loss) are attributable to foreign exchange contract activity and are primarily recorded as a component of Products sales when reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive loss. The Company utilizes the critical terms match method in assessing derivatives for hedge effectiveness. Accordingly, the hedged items and derivatives designated as hedging instruments are highly effective. As of December 31, 2022, we have € 500 million of euro-denominated long-term debt outstanding, which qualifies as a net investment hedge against our investments in European businesses, which is deemed to be effective. The effect of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is included within Other income, net, on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and is not material. NOTE 15: FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The following tables provide the valuation hierarchy classification of assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value and measured on a recurring basis in our Consolidated Balance Sheet: December 31, 2022 (dollars in millions) Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Recurring fair value measurements: Marketable securities held in trusts $ 774 $ 713 $ 61 $ — Derivative assets 84 — 84 — Derivative liabilities 386 — 386 — December 31, 2021 (dollars in millions) Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Recurring fair value measurements: Marketable securities held in trusts $ 965 $ 890 $ 75 $ — Derivative assets 70 — 70 — Derivative liabilities 213 — 213 — Valuation Techniques. Our derivative assets and liabilities include foreign exchange contracts that are measured at fair value using internal models based on observable market inputs such as forward rates, interest rates, our own credit risk and our counterparties’ credit risks. As of December 31, 2022, there has not been any significant impact to the fair value of our derivative liabilities due to our own credit risk. Similarly, there has not been any significant adverse impact to our derivative assets based on our evaluation of our counterparties’ credit risks. 101 Table of Contents The following table provides carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments that are not carried at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31: 2022 2021 (dollars in millions) Carrying Amount Fair Value Carrying Amount Fair Value Customer financing notes receivables $ 169 $ 161 $ 195 $ 192 Long-term debt (excluding finance leases) 31,201 28,049 31,250 35,828 The following table provides the valuation hierarchy classification of assets and liabilities that are not carried at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31: December 31, 2022 (dollars in millions) Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Customer financing notes receivables $ 161 $ — $ 161 $ — Long-term debt (excluding finance leases) 28,049 — 28,003 46 December 31, 2021 (dollars in millions) Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Customer financing notes receivables $ 192 $ — $ 192 $ — Long-term debt (excluding finance leases) 35,828 — 35,778 50 The fair value of our Short-term borrowings approximates the carrying value due to their short-term nature, with commercial paper classified as level 2 and other short-term borrowings classified as level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. NOTE 16: VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES Pratt & Whitney holds a 61 % program share interest in the International Aero Engines AG (IAE) collaboration with MTU Aero Engines AG (MTU) and Japanese Aero Engines Corporation (JAEC) and a 49.5 % ownership interest in IAE. IAE’s business purpose is to coordinate the design, development, manufacturing and product support of the V2500 engine program through involvement with the collaborators. Additionally, Pratt & Whitney, JAEC and MTU are participants in the International Aero Engines, LLC (IAE LLC) collaboration, whose business purpose is to coordinate the design, development, manufacturing and product support for the PW1100G-JM engine for the Airbus A320neo family of aircraft. Pratt & Whitney holds a 59 % program share interest and a 59 % ownership interest in IAE LLC. IAE and IAE LLC retain limited equity with the primary economics of the programs passed to the participants. As such, we have determined that IAE and IAE LLC are variable interest entities with Pratt & Whitney as the primary beneficiary. IAE and IAE LLC have, therefore, been consolidated. The carrying amounts and classification of assets and liabilities for variable interest entities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows: (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 Current assets $ 7,609 $ 7,081 Noncurrent assets 779 825 Total assets $ 8,388 $ 7,906 Current liabilities $ 9,154 $ 7,965 Noncurrent liabilities 19 54 Total liabilities $ 9,173 $ 8,019 NOTE 17: GUARANTEES We extend a variety of financial, market value and product performance guarantees to third parties. These instruments expire on various dates through 2028. Additional guarantees of project performance for which there is no stated value also remain 102 Table of Contents outstanding. A portion of our third party guarantees are subject to indemnification for our benefit for any liabilities that could arise. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the following financial guarantees were outstanding: December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 (dollars in millions) Maximum Potential Payment Carrying Amount of Liability Maximum Potential Payment Carrying Amount of Liability Commercial aerospace financing arrangements $ 304 $ — $ 309 $ 3 Third party guarantees 335 1 511 5 We have made residual value and other guarantees related to various commercial aerospace customer financing arrangements. The estimated fair market values of the guaranteed assets equal or exceed the value of the related guarantees, net of existing reserves. Collaboration partners’ share of these financing guarantees is $ 140 million and $ 141 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We also have obligations arising from sales of certain businesses and assets, including those from representations and warranties and related indemnities for environmental, health and safety, tax and employment matters. The maximum potential payment related to these obligations is not a specified amount as a number of the obligations do not contain financial caps. The carrying amount of liabilities related to these obligations was $ 97 million and $ 120 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These primarily relate to environmental liabilities, which are included in our total environmental liabilities as further discussed in “Note 18: Commitments and Contingencies.” We accrue for costs associated with guarantees when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of currently available facts, and where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, the minimum is accrued. We also provide service and warranty policies on our products and extend performance and operating cost guarantees beyond our normal service and warranty policies on some of our products, particularly commercial aircraft engines. In addition, we incur discretionary costs to service our products in connection with specific product performance issues. Liabilities for performance and operating cost guarantees are based upon future product performance and durability, and are largely estimated based upon historical experience. Adjustments are made to accruals as claims data and historical experience warrant. The changes in the carrying amount of service and product warranties and product performance guarantees for the years ended December 31 were as follows: (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Balance as of January 1 $ 1,157 $ 1,057 $ 1,033 Warranties and performance guarantees issued 264 380 311 Settlements ( 284 ) ( 272 ) ( 292 ) Other ( 28 ) ( 8 ) 5 Balance as of December 31 $ 1,109 $ 1,157 $ 1,057 NOTE 18: COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Except as otherwise noted, while we are unable to predict the final outcome, based on information currently available, we do not believe that resolution of any of the following matters will have a material adverse effect upon our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Environmental. Our operations are subject to environmental regulation by federal, state and local authorities in the United States and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our foreign operations. We have accrued for the costs of environmental remediation activities, including but not limited to investigatory, remediation, operating and maintenance costs and performance guarantees, and periodically reassess these amounts. We do not expect any additional liability to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had $ 798 million and $ 834 million, respectively, reserved for environmental remediation. Additional information pertaining to environmental matters is included in “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles.” Commercial Aerospace Financing and Other Commitments. We had commercial aerospace financing commitments and other contractual commitments of approximately $ 15.3 billion and $ 15.6 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, on a gross basis before reduction for our collaboration partners’ share. Aircraft financing commitments, in the form of debt or lease financing, are provided to certain commercial aerospace customers. The extent to which the financing commitments will be utilized is not currently known, since customers may be able to obtain more favorable terms from other 103 Table of Contents financing sources. We may also arrange for third-party investors to assume a portion of these commitments. The majority of financing commitments are collateralized arrangements. We may also lease aircraft and subsequently sublease the aircraft to customers under long-term non-cancelable operating leases, or pay deposits on behalf of our customers to secure production slots with the airframers (pre-delivery payments). Our financing commitments with customers are contingent upon maintenance of certain levels of financial condition by the customers. Associated risks on these commitments are mitigated due to the fact that interest rates are variable during the commitment term and are set at the date of funding based on current market conditions, the fair value of the underlying collateral and the credit worthiness of the customers. As a result, the fair value of these financing commitments is expected to equal the amounts funded. We also have other contractual commitments to make payments to secure certain contractual rights to provide product on new aircraft platforms. The estimated amount and timing of these payments, which are generally based on future sales or engine flight hours, are reflected in “Other commercial aerospace commitments” in the table below. Payments made on these contractual commitments are included within intangible assets as exclusivity assets and are amortized over the term of underlying economic benefit. We have entered into certain collaboration arrangements, which may include participation by our collaboration partners in these commitments. In addition, in connection with our 2012 agreement to acquire Rolls-Royce’s ownership and collaboration interests in IAE, additional payments are due to Rolls-Royce contingent upon each hour flown through June 2027 by the V2500-powered aircraft in service as of the acquisition date. These flight hour payments, which are considered in “Other commercial aerospace commitments” below, will be capitalized as collaboration intangible assets as payments are made. The following is the expected maturity of our commercial aerospace industry commitments as of December 31, 2022: (dollars in millions) Committed 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter Commercial aerospace financing commitments $ 4,559 $ 1,559 $ 1,405 $ 980 $ 556 $ 59 $ — Other commercial aerospace commitments 10,710 1,147 883 794 695 717 6,474 Collaboration partners’ share ( 5,905 ) ( 915 ) ( 863 ) ( 714 ) ( 535 ) ( 331 ) ( 2,547 ) Total commercial aerospace commitments $ 9,364 $ 1,791 $ 1,425 $ 1,060 $ 716 $ 445 $ 3,927 Other Financing Arrangements. We have entered into standby letters of credit and surety bonds with financial institutions to meet various bid, performance, warranty, retention and advance payment obligations for us or our affiliates. We enter into these agreements to assist certain affiliates in obtaining financing on more favorable terms, making bids on contracts and performing their contractual obligations. The stated values of these letters of credit agreements and surety bonds totaled $ 3.3 billion as of December 31, 2022. Offset Obligations. We have entered into industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes in the form of either offset agreements or ICIP agreements, as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services from certain customers in foreign countries. At December 31, 2022, the aggregate amount of our offset agreements, both agreed to and anticipated to be agreed to, had an outstanding notional value of approximately $ 11.3 billion. These agreements are designed to return economic value to the foreign country by requiring us to engage in activities supporting local defense or commercial industries, promoting a balance of trade, developing in-country technology capabilities or addressing other local development priorities. Offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require a direct cash payment, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing, training and other consulting support to in-country projects, and the purchase by third parties (e.g., our vendors) of supplies from in-country vendors. These agreements may also be satisfied through our use of cash for activities such as subcontracting with local partners, purchasing supplies from in-country vendors, providing financial support for in-country projects and making investments in local ventures. Such activities may also vary by country depending upon requirements as dictated by their governments. We typically do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive. The amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customers and typically require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the notional value in the offset agreements. Offset programs usually extend over several or more years and may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirements. Historically, we have not been required to pay any penalties of significance. Government Oversight. In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries and our properties are subject to regulatory and governmental examinations, information gathering requests, inquiries, investigations and threatened legal actions and proceedings. For example, we are now, and believe that, in light of the current U.S. government contracting environment, we will continue to be the subject of one or more U.S. government investigations. Our contracts with the U.S. government are also subject to audits. Agencies that oversee contract performance include: the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA), the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), the Inspectors General of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and other 104 Table of Contents departments and agencies, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the Department of Justice (DOJ), and Congressional Committees. Other areas of our business operations may also be subject to audit and investigation by these and other agencies. From time to time, agencies investigate or conduct audits to determine whether our operations are being conducted in accordance with applicable requirements. Such investigations and audits may be initiated due to a number of reasons, including as a result of a whistleblower complaint. Such investigations and audits could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, including repayments, fines, treble or other damages, forfeitures, restitution, or penalties being imposed upon us, the suspension of government export licenses or the suspension or debarment from future U.S. government contracting. U.S. government investigations often take years to complete. The U.S. government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent, criminal or other seriously improper conduct. The U.S. government could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud. Like many defense contractors, we have received audit reports recommending the reduction of certain contract prices because, for example, cost or pricing data or cost accounting practices used to price and negotiate those contracts may not have conformed to government regulations. Some of these audit reports recommend that certain payments be repaid, delayed, or withheld, and may involve substantial amounts. We have made voluntary refunds in those cases we believe appropriate, have settled some allegations and, in some cases, continue to negotiate and/or litigate. The Company may be, and in some cases has been, required to make payments into escrow of disputed liabilities while the related litigation is pending. If the litigation is resolved in the Company’s favor, any such payments will be returned to the Company with interest. Our final allowable incurred costs for each year are also subject to audit and have, from time to time, resulted in disputes between us and the U.S. government, with litigation resulting at the Court of Federal Claims (COFC) or the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (ASBCA) or their related courts of appeals. In addition, the DOJ has, from time to time, convened grand juries to investigate possible irregularities by us. We also provide products and services to customers outside of the U.S., and those sales are subject to local government laws, regulations and procurement policies and practices. Our compliance with such local government regulations or any applicable U.S. government regulations (e.g., the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)) may also be investigated or audited. In addition, we accrue for liabilities associated with those matters that are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The most likely liability amount to be incurred is accrued based upon a range of estimates. Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, then we accrue the minimum amount. Other than as specifically disclosed in this Form 10-K, we do not expect these audits, investigations or disputes to have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity, either individually or in the aggregate. Tax Treatment of Carrier and Otis Dispositions. Management has determined that the distributions of Carrier and Otis on April 3, 2020, and certain related internal business separation transactions, qualified as tax-free under applicable law. In making these determinations, we applied the tax law in the relevant jurisdictions to our facts and circumstances and obtained tax rulings from the relevant taxing authorities, tax opinions, and/or other external tax advice related to the concluded tax treatment. If the completed distributions of Carrier or Otis or certain internal business separation transactions, were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment, the Company could be subject to significant liabilities, and there could be material adverse impacts on the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity in future reporting periods. Legal Proceedings. The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to various contract pricing disputes, government investigations and litigation matters across jurisdictions, updates to certain of which are set forth below. Cost Accounting Standards Claims As previously disclosed, in April 2019, a Divisional Administrative Contracting Officer (DACO) of the United States DCMA asserted a claim against Pratt & Whitney to recover alleged overpayments of approximately $ 1.73 billion plus interest ($ 843 million at December 31, 2022). The claim is based on Pratt & Whitney’s alleged noncompliance with Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) from January 1, 2007 to March 31, 2019, due to its method of allocating independent research and development costs to government contracts. Pratt & Whitney believes that the claim is without merit and filed an appeal to the ASBCA on June 7, 2019. As previously disclosed, in December 2013, a DCMA DACO asserted a claim against Pratt & Whitney to recover alleged overpayments of approximately $ 177 million plus interest ($ 132 million at December 31, 2022). The claim is based on Pratt & Whitney’s alleged noncompliance with CAS from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2012, due to its method of determining the cost of collaborator parts used in the calculation of material overhead costs for government contracts. In 2014, Pratt & Whitney filed an appeal to the ASBCA. An evidentiary hearing was held and completed in June 2019. On November 22, 2021, the ASBCA issued its written decision sustaining in part and denying in part Pratt & Whitney’s appeal. The ASBCA rejected the DCMA’s asserted measure of the cost of collaborator parts, and ruled substantially in Pratt & Whitney’s favor on other liability issues. The ASBCA remanded the appeal to the parties for resolution of damages issues, which could require further proceedings at the ASBCA. On December 23, 2021, the DCMA filed a motion with the ASBCA seeking partial reconsideration of the November 22, 2021 decision. The motion for reconsideration was denied on August 29, 2022. On December 23, 2022, the DCMA filed an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. We continue to believe that the 105 Table of Contents ASBCA’s rejection of the DCMA’s asserted measure of the cost of collaborator parts is well supported in fact and law and likely will be sustained. In December 2018, a DCMA DACO issued a second claim against Pratt & Whitney that similarly alleges that its method of determining the cost of collaborator parts does not comply with the CAS for calendar years 2013 through 2017. This second claim, which asserts the same measure of the cost of collaborator parts rejected by the ASBCA’s recent decision, demands payment of $ 269 million plus interest ($ 96 million at December 31, 2022). Pratt & Whitney appealed this second claim to the ASBCA in January 2019. Although subject to further litigation at the ASBCA and potentially further litigation at the ASBCA and potentially further appellate proceedings, we continue to believe that the November 22, 2021 decision in the first claim will apply with equal legal effect to the second claim. Accordingly, we believe that the amounts demanded by the DCMA as set forth in the two claims are without legal basis and that any damages owed to the U.S. government for the two claims will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Thales-Raytheon Systems and Related Matters As previously disclosed, in 2019, Raytheon Company received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seeking information in connection with an investigation into whether there were improper payments made by Raytheon Company, our joint venture known as Thales-Raytheon Systems (TRS) or anyone acting on their behalf in connection with TRS or Raytheon Company contracts in certain Middle East countries since 2014. In the first quarter of 2020, the DOJ advised Raytheon Company it had opened a parallel criminal investigation. In the third quarter of 2020, Raytheon Company received an additional subpoena from the SEC, seeking information and documents as part of its ongoing investigation. The Company maintains a rigorous anti-corruption compliance program, and continues to cooperate fully with the SEC’s and DOJ’s inquiries and to examine through our own investigation whether there were any improper payments or any such conduct that was in violation of Raytheon Company policy. At this time, the Company is unable to predict the outcome of the SEC’s or DOJ’s inquiries. Based on the information available to date, however, we cannot reasonably estimate the range of any potential loss or impact to the business that may result, but do not believe that the results of these inquiries will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. DOJ Investigation, Contract Pricing Disputes and Related Civil Litigation As previously disclosed, on October 8, 2020, the Company received a criminal subpoena from the DOJ seeking information and documents in connection with an investigation relating to financial accounting, internal controls over financial reporting, and cost reporting regarding Raytheon Company’s Missiles & Defense (RMD) business since 2009. The investigation involves multi-year contracts subject to governmental regulation, including potential civil defective pricing claims for three RMD contracts entered into between 2011 and 2013. As part of the same investigation, on March 24, 2021, the Company received a second criminal subpoena from the DOJ seeking documents relating to a different RMD contract entered into in 2017. We are cooperating fully with, and will continue to review the issues raised by the DOJ’s ongoing investigation. We continue to make substantial progress in our internal review of the issues raised by the DOJ investigation. Although we believe we have defenses to the potential claims, the Company has determined that there is a probable risk of liability for damages, interest and potential penalties and has accrued approximately $ 290 million for this matter. We are currently unable to estimate an incremental loss, if any, which may result when the DOJ investigation is complete. Based on the information available to date, we do not believe the results of the DOJ investigation or of any pending or potential civil litigation will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Four shareholder lawsuits were filed against the Company after the DOJ investigation was first disclosed. A putative securities class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona against the Company and certain of its executives alleging that the defendants violated federal securities laws by making material misstatements in regulatory filings regarding internal controls over financial reporting in RMD. Three shareholder derivative lawsuits were also filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against the former Raytheon Company Board of Directors, the Company and certain of its executives, each alleging that defendants violated federal securities laws and breached their fiduciary duties by engaging in improper accounting practices, failing to implement sufficient internal financial and compliance controls, and making a series of false and misleading statements in regulatory filings. We believe that each of these lawsuits lacks merit. Darnis, et al. and Related Matter As previously disclosed, on August 12, 2020, several former employees of UTC or its subsidiaries filed a putative class action complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut against the Company, Otis, Carrier, the former members of the UTC Board of Directors, and the members of the Carrier and Otis Boards of Directors (Geraud Darnis, et al. v. Raytheon Technologies Corporation, et al.). The complaint challenged the method by which UTC equity awards were converted to Company, Otis, and Carrier equity awards following the separation of UTC into three independent, publicly-traded companies on April 3, 2020. The complaint also claimed that the defendants are liable for breach of certain equity 106 Table of Contents compensation plans and also asserted claims under certain provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). On September 13, 2021, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint which supersedes the initial complaint and continues to assert claims for breach of the equity compensation plans against the Company, Otis and Carrier, but no longer asserts ERISA claims. Further, no claim is made in the amended complaint against any current or former director of any of the three companies. Plaintiffs seek money damages, attorneys’ fees and other relief. On September 30, 2022, in response to motions to dismiss filed by the Company, Otis and Carrier, the Court dismissed the class action in its entirety with prejudice. On October 26, 2022, Plaintiffs filed an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. We continue to believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. On December 6, 2022, a shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against the Company and certain current and former members of its Board of Directors, alleging that defendants breached their fiduciary duties in May 2020 by amending the method by which UTC equity awards were converted to certain Company equity awards following the separation of UTC into three independent, publicly-traded companies. We believe that the lawsuit lacks merit. DOJ Grand Jury Investigation and Related Civil Litigation The Company received a grand jury subpoena in late 2019, as part of a DOJ criminal investigation into purported agreements not to solicit or hire employees in violation of the federal antitrust laws. While the investigation has focused on alleged hiring restrictions between and among Pratt & Whitney and certain of its suppliers of outsourced engineering services, the subpoena also included requests regarding Collins. Since receipt of the subpoena, the Company has been cooperating with the DOJ investigation. On December 15, 2021, a criminal indictment was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, against a former Pratt & Whitney employee and other employees of certain outsourced engineering suppliers charging each of them with one count of violating the federal antitrust laws. No current or former Collins employees were named in the indictment. We have been advised that the Company is a target of the DOJ investigation, and we continue to cooperate with the investigation. No criminal charge has been filed against the Company or its affiliates. After the criminal charges against the individuals were filed, numerous civil class action antitrust lawsuits have been filed against Pratt & Whitney and other corporate and individual defendants in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut. The allegations in each of the civil lawsuits track the factual assertions in the criminal indictment and generally allege that Pratt & Whitney and the other defendants agreed to restrict the hiring and recruiting of certain engineers and skilled laborers in a manner that violated federal antitrust laws. Plaintiffs in each of the civil lawsuits seek to represent different purported classes of engineers and skilled laborers employed by Pratt & Whitney and other supplier-defendants since 2011. Plaintiffs in each of the lawsuits seek treble damages in an undetermined amount, plus attorneys’ fees and costs of suit. All of the lawsuits have been consolidated and a single amended class action complaint was filed. We believe that the claims asserted lack merit. Based on the information available to date, we do not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Where appropriate, we have recorded loss contingency accruals for the above-referenced matters, and the amounts individually, or in the aggregate, are not material. Other. As described in “Note 17: Guarantees,” we extend performance and operating cost guarantees beyond our normal warranty and service policies for extended periods on some of our products. We have accrued our estimate of the liability that may result under these guarantees and for service costs that are probable and can be reasonably estimated. We also have other commitments and contingent liabilities related to legal proceedings, self-insurance programs and matters arising out of the normal course of business. We accrue contingencies based upon a range of possible outcomes. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other, then we accrue the minimum amount. In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are also routinely defendants in, parties to or otherwise subject to many pending and threatened legal actions, claims, disputes and proceedings. These matters are often based on alleged violations of contract, product liability, warranty, regulatory, environmental, health and safety, employment, intellectual property, tax and other laws. In some instances, claims for substantial monetary damages are asserted against the Company and its subsidiaries and could result in fines, penalties, compensatory or treble damages or non-monetary relief. We do not believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. 107 Table of Contents NOTE 19: ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS A summary of the changes in each component of Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, net of tax is provided below: (dollars in millions) Foreign Currency Translation Defined Benefit Pension and Postretirement Plans Unrealized Hedging (Losses) Gains Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income Balance at December 31, 2019 $ ( 3,211 ) $ ( 6,772 ) $ ( 166 ) $ ( 10,149 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications, net 609 1,842 181 2,632 Amounts reclassified, pre-tax — 373 82 455 Tax benefit (expense) 25 ( 510 ) ( 62 ) ( 547 ) Separation of Carrier and Otis, net of tax 3,287 584 4 3,875 Balance at December 31, 2020 $ 710 $ ( 4,483 ) $ 39 $ ( 3,734 ) Other comprehensive income before reclassifications, net ( 647 ) 3,210 ( 226 ) 2,337 Amounts reclassified, pre-tax — 258 ( 28 ) 230 Tax benefit (expense) ( 14 ) ( 813 ) 79 ( 748 ) Balance at December 31, 2021 $ 49 $ ( 1,828 ) $ ( 136 ) $ ( 1,915 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications, net ( 1,050 ) 1,225 ( 246 ) ( 71 ) Amounts reclassified, pre-tax 2 129 103 234 Tax benefit (expense) ( 6 ) ( 308 ) 48 ( 266 ) Balance at December 31, 2022 $ ( 1,005 ) $ ( 782 ) $ ( 231 ) $ ( 2,018 ) Amounts reclassified that relate to our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans include the amortization of prior service costs and actuarial net gains or losses recognized during each period presented. These costs are recorded as components of net periodic pension income for each period presented. See “Note 11: Employee Benefit Plans” for additional details. All noncontrolling interests with redemption features, such as put options, that are not solely within our control (redeemable noncontrolling interests) are reported in the mezzanine section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet, between liabilities and equity, at the greater of redemption value or initial carrying value. NOTE 20: STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION RTC’s long-term incentive plans authorize various types of market and performance based incentive awards that may be granted to officers and key employees. Certain historic awards remain outstanding under predecessor plans. The Raytheon Technologies Corporation 2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (2018 LTIP) was approved by shareowners on April 26, 2021. A total of 134.8 million shares have been authorized for issuance pursuant to awards under the 2018 LTIP including shares assumed from predecessor plans. There is also an additional 21.5 million shares for future issuance due to adjustments related to the Separation Transactions. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 81.2 million shares remain available for awards under the 2018 LTIP. The 2018 LTIP does not contain aggregate annual award limits, however, it sets an annual award limit per participant. The 2018 LTIP will expire after all authorized shares have been awarded or April 26, 2031, whichever is sooner. Under the 2018 LTIP, the exercise price of awards is set on the grant date and may not be less than the fair market value per share on that date. Generally, stock appreciation rights and stock options have a term of ten years and a three-year vesting period, subject to limited exceptions. In the event of retirement, annual stock appreciation rights, stock options, and RSUs held for more than one year may become vested and exercisable, subject to certain terms and conditions. LTIP awards with performance-based vesting generally have a minimum three-year vesting period and vest based on actual performance against pre-established metrics. In the event of retirement, performance-based awards held for more than one year, remain eligible to vest based on actual performance relative to performance goals. We have historically repurchased shares of our common stock in an amount at least equal to the number of shares issued under our equity compensation arrangements and will continue to evaluate this policy in conjunction with our overall share repurchase program. 108 Table of Contents We measure the cost of all share-based payments, including stock options and stock appreciation rights, at fair value on the grant date and recognize this cost in the Consolidated Statement of Operations, net of expected forfeitures, as follows: (dollars in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Total compensation cost recognized $ 420 $ 442 $ 330 The associated future income tax benefit recognized was $ 91 million, $ 83 million and $ 63 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the amount of cash received from the exercise of stock options was $ 20 million, $ 7 million and $ 15 million, respectively, with an associated tax benefit realized of $ 32 million, $ 42 million and $ 48 million, respectively. In addition, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the associated tax benefit realized from the vesting of performance share units (PSUs), restricted stock awards and RSUs was $ 80 million, $ 44 million and $ 58 million, respectively. At December 31, 2022, there was $ 329 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested equity awards granted under long-term incentive plans. This cost is expected to be recognized ratably over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years. A summary of the transactions under our long-term incentive plans for the year ended December 31, 2022 follows. Stock Options Stock Appreciation Rights Performance Share Units Restricted Stock and RSUs (shares and units in thousands) Shares Average Price (1) Shares Average Price (1) Units Average Price (2) Units Average Price (1) Outstanding at: December 31, 2021 1,849 $ 78.36 33,061 $ 78.62 1,265 $ 73.75 11,443 $ 66.18 Granted 102 94.04 3,225 94.06 990 96.15 3,441 97.76 Exercised / earned ( 283 ) 70.20 ( 3,827 ) 70.53 ( 1 ) 80.53 ( 4,476 ) 62.03 Cancelled ( 11 ) 94.04 ( 427 ) 86.34 ( 104 ) 85.06 ( 651 ) 78.38 December 31, 2022 1,657 $ 80.67 32,032 $ 81.04 2,150 $ 83.52 9,757 $ 78.40 (1) Weighted-average exercise price. (2) Weighted-average grant date fair value. The weighted-average grant date fair value of stock options and stock appreciation rights granted during 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 21.80 , $ 15.60 and $ 23.37 , respectively. The weighted-average grant date fair value of performance share units, which vest upon achieving certain performance metrics, granted during 2022 and 2021 was $ 96.15 and $ 73.75 , respectively. There were no performance share units granted in 2020. The total fair value of awards vested during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 346 million, $ 287 million and $ 284 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value (which is the amount by which the stock price exceeded the exercise price on the date of exercise) of stock options and stock appreciation rights exercised during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 110 million, $ 54 million and $ 206 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value (which is the stock price at vesting multiplied by the number of underlying shares) of performance share units and other restricted awards vested was $ 427 million, $ 256 million and $ 295 million during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The following table summarizes information about equity awards outstanding that are vested and expected to vest as well as equity awards outstanding that are exercisable at December 31, 2022: Equity Awards Vested and Expected to Vest Equity Awards That Are Exercisable (shares in thousands; aggregate intrinsic value in millions) Awards Average Price (1) Aggregate Intrinsic Value Remaining Term (2) Awards Average Price (1) Aggregate Intrinsic Value Remaining Term (2) Stock Options 1,654 $ 80.61 $ 34 5.36 1,182 $ 77.13 $ 28 4.47 Stock Appreciation Rights 31,896 81.01 635 5.56 22,118 77.68 514 4.52 Performance Share Units 2,105 83.41 212 1.48 Restricted Stock and RSUs 9,417 78.02 950 1.54 (1) Weighted-average exercise price per share. (2) Weighted-average contractual remaining term in years. 109 Table of Contents The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial lattice model. The following table indicates the assumptions used in estimating fair value for awards granted during 2022, 2021 and 2020. Lattice-based option models incorporate ranges of assumptions for inputs; those ranges are as follows: 2022 2021 2020 Expected volatility 27.9 % 29.9 % 18.8 % Weighted-average volatility 28 % 30 % 19 % Expected term (in years) 6.5 6.5 6.5 Expected dividend yield 2.2 % 2.6 % 1.9 % Risk-free rate 0.02 % - 2.1 % 0.04 % - 1.2 % 1.4 % - 1.6 % Expected volatilities are based on the returns of our stock, including implied volatilities from traded options on our stock for the binomial lattice model. We use historical data to estimate equity award exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model. The expected term represents an estimate of the period of time equity awards are expected to remain outstanding. The risk-free rate is based on the term structure of interest rates at the time of equity award grant. NOTE 21: SEGMENT FINANCIAL DATA Our operations, for the periods presented herein, are classified into four principal segments: Collins, Pratt & Whitney, RIS and RMD. The segments are generally based on the management structure of the businesses and the grouping of similar operating companies, where each management organization has general operating autonomy over diversified products and services. The results of RIS and RMD reflect the period subsequent to the completion of the Raytheon merger on April 3, 2020. The Company recently announced its intention to streamline the structure of its core businesses into three principal business segments: Collins Aerospace, Pratt & Whitney and Raytheon. The Company plans to determine the exact composition of each segment and implement the reorganization in the second half of 2023, at which time management will begin to manage its operations under its new segment structure. The changes will require the Company to revise its segment reporting.

Segment Information. Total sales and operating profit by segment include inter-segment sales which are generally recorded at cost-plus a specified fee or at a negotiated fixed price. These pricing arrangements may result in margins different than what the purchasing segment realizes on the ultimate third-party sales. We present a FAS/CAS operating adjustment outside of segment results, which represents the difference between the service cost component of our pension and PRB expense under the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) requirements of U.S. GAAP and our pension and PRB expense under U.S. government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) primarily related to our RIS and RMD segments. While the ultimate liability for pension and PRB costs under FAS and CAS is similar, the pattern of cost recognition is different. Over time, we generally expect to recover the related RIS and RMD pension and PRB liabilities through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and the Corporate Vice President and Controller (Controller), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Based upon our evaluation, our CEO, CFO and Controller concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO, CFO and Controller, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Our management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in its 2013 Internal Control – Integrated Framework. Our management has concluded that based on its assessment, our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K . There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

BUSINESS General Raytheon Technologies Corporation is an aerospace and defense company that provides advanced systems and services for commercial, military and government customers worldwide. The terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “Raytheon Technologies,” “RTC” and the “Company” mean Raytheon Technologies Corporation, unless the context indicates another meaning. We serve commercial and government customers in both the original equipment and aftermarket parts and services segments of the aerospace industry. Our defense business serves both domestic and international customers as a prime contractor or subcontractor on a broad portfolio of defense and related programs for military and government customers. Raytheon Technologies, formerly known as United Technologies Corporation (UTC), was incorporated in Delaware in 1934 and represents the combination of UTC’s aerospace businesses and Raytheon Company through the Separation Transactions and Distributions and Raytheon Merger completed in April 2020, as described in more detail below. The following description of our business should be read in conjunction with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” within Item 7 of this Form 10-K, including the information contained therein under the heading “Business Overview.” Separation Transactions and Distributions; Raytheon Merger. On April 3, 2020, UTC completed the separation of its business into three independent, publicly traded companies – UTC, Carrier Global Corporation (Carrier) and Otis Worldwide Corporation (Otis) (such separations, the “Separation Transactions”). UTC distributed all of the outstanding shares of Carrier common stock and all of the outstanding shares of Otis common stock to UTC shareowners who held shares of UTC common stock as of the close of business on March 19, 2020, the record date for the distributions (the “Distributions”) effective at 12:01 a.m., Eastern Time, on April 3, 2020. The historical results of Carrier and Otis are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Immediately following the completion of the Separation Transactions and the Distributions, on April 3, 2020, UTC and Raytheon Company completed their all-stock merger of equals transaction (the “Raytheon Merger”), pursuant to which Raytheon Company became a wholly-owned subsidiary of UTC and UTC was renamed “Raytheon Technologies Corporation.” Business Segments Our operations are classified into four principal business segments: Collins Aerospace Systems, Pratt & Whitney, Raytheon Intelligence & Space and Raytheon Missiles & Defense, with each segment comprised of groups of similar operations.

Pratt & Whitney’s Commercial Engines and Military Engines businesses design, develop, produce and maintain families of large engines for wide- and narrow-body and large regional aircraft for commercial customers and for fighter, bomber, tanker and transport aircraft for military customers. Pratt & Whitney’s small engine business, Pratt & Whitney Canada (P&WC), is among the world’s leading suppliers of engines powering regional airlines, general and business aviation, as well as helicopters. Pratt & Whitney also produces, sells and services military and commercial auxiliary power units. Pratt & Whitney provides fleet management services and aftermarket maintenance, repair and overhaul services in all of these segments. Pratt & Whitney sells products and services principally to aircraft manufacturers, airlines and other aircraft operators, aircraft leasing companies and the U.S. and foreign governments. Pratt & Whitney’s largest commercial customer by sales is Airbus, with sales, prior to discounts and incentives, of 31%, 30% and 31% of total Pratt & Whitney segment sales in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Pratt & Whitney produces the PW1000G Geared Turbofan (GTF) engine family, the first of which, the PW1100G-JM, entered into service in January 2016. The PW1000G GTF engine has demonstrated a significant reduction in fuel burn and noise levels and lower environmental emissions when compared to legacy engines. The PW1100G-JM engine is offered on the Airbus A320neo family of aircraft. PW1000G GTF engine models also power the Airbus A220 passenger aircraft and Embraer’s E-Jet E2 family of aircraft and have been certified by the Russian civil aviation authority to power the Irkut MC-21 passenger aircraft. In addition, P&WC’s PW800 engine has been selected to exclusively power Gulfstream’s G400, G500 and G600 business jets, as well as to power Dassault’s Falcon 6X business jet, which is scheduled to enter into service in 2022. Pratt & Whitney is under contract to produce and sustain the F135 engine for the U.S. government’s F-35 Joint Program Office to power the single-engine F-35 Lightning II aircraft (commonly known as the Joint Strike Fighter) produced by Lockheed Martin. F135 propulsion system configurations are used for the U.S Air Force’s F-35A, the U.S. Marine Corps’ F-35B and the U.S. Navy’s F-35C jets. F135 engines are also used on F-35 aircraft purchased by Joint Strike Fighter partner countries and other countries through foreign military sales arrangements. Pratt & Whitney is also under contract to build engines for the U.S. Air Force’s B-21 long-range strike bomber and to develop next-generation adaptive engines for the U.S. Air Force.

Other Matters Relating to Our Business As worldwide businesses, our operations can be affected by a variety of economic, industry and other factors, including those described in this section, in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” in Item 1, “Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results,” and in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to negatively affect the global economy, our business and operations, and the industries in which we operate. Government, business and individual actions in response to COVID-19 have resulted in continued disruption to air travel and commercial activities and significant restrictions and limitations on businesses, particularly within the aerospace and commercial airline industries. While commercial air travel in certain areas appears to be recovering, it continues to lag in other areas and remains below pre-pandemic levels. Overall, the ongoing disruption from the pandemic continues to adversely affect our airline and airframer customers and their demand for 6 Table of Contents the products and services of our Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney businesses. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic and continuing economic recovery continues to negatively impact the global supply chain and distribution capabilities and we have experienced negative impacts from supply chain pressures. The pandemic continues to cause product and labor shortages, delivery delays, and increased costs of raw materials, labor and supplier products and services around the world. We are working with our suppliers and subcontractors to mitigate delays in our receipt of necessary raw materials, components and other supplies and to reduce supply chain costs. Our RIS and RMD businesses, although experiencing some negative impacts, including from the supply chain pressures and labor shortages discussed above, have not experienced significant business disruptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. For additional information related to the COVID-19 pandemic, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K. Sales and Customers We have substantial U.S. government sales, which we conduct through all four of our business segments. RIS and RMD together represent a significant portion of those sales. In addition, as a global company, all four of our business segments have substantial international sales. U.S. Government Sales. Our U.S. government sales were as follows: (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Sales to the U.S. government (1) $ 31,177 $ 25,962 $ 9,094 Sales to the U.S. government as a percentage of Total Net Sales (1) 48 % 46 % 20 % (1) Excludes foreign military sales through the U.S. government. See “Note 22: Segment Financial Data” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. International Sales. Our sales to international customers, based on customer end use location, were as follows: (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Total international sales (1) $ 24,377 $ 22,027 $ 23,952 Total international sales as a percentage of Total Net Sales (1) 38 % 39 % 53 % (1) Includes foreign military sales through the U.S. government. See “Note 22: Segment Financial Data” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. Backlog. Backlog, which is equivalent to our remaining performance obligations (RPO) for our sales contracts, represents the aggregate dollar value of firm orders for which products have not been provided or service has not been performed and excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering-type contracts (e.g., indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) type contracts). Total backlog was $156 billion and $150 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Approximately 70% of our consolidated backlog as of December 31, 2021 is not expected to be realized as sales in the next twelve months . Defense backlog primarily relates to backlog with government customers and is included within our total backlog. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, our defense backlog was approximately 41% and 45%, respectively, of total backlog. Competition All of our businesses are subject to significant competition. Our businesses compete on a variety of factors such as price, delivery schedule, past performance, reliability, customer service, product development, innovation and technology. Many of our competitors have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities. Further, some non-U.S. competitors receive government research and development assistance, marketing subsidies and other assistance for their products beyond the assistance that may be available to us as a U.S. company. In addition, the competitive landscape in the industry segments we serve continues to evolve with trends such as increased vertical integration by competitors and customers and the emergence of more commercial competitors on defense development programs. Our aerospace businesses compete with numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers, customers and companies that obtain regulatory agency approval to manufacture spare parts. Customer selections of aircraft engines, components and systems can also have a significant impact on future sales of parts and services. In addition, the U.S. government’s and other governments’ policies of purchasing parts from suppliers other than the original equipment manufacturer affect military spare parts sales. Some competitors may offer substantial discounts and other financial incentives, performance and operating cost guarantees, and participation in financing arrangements in an effort to compete for the aftermarket associated with these products. 7 Table of Contents Our defense businesses compete with numerous U.S. and foreign companies in most defense and government electronics, space, information technology and technical services and support segments. We frequently partner on defense programs with our major suppliers, some of whom are, from time to time, competitors on other programs. People As a global technology and innovation-driven company, we depend on a highly skilled workforce. Attracting, developing, advancing and retaining the best talent is critical for us to execute our strategy and grow our business. We strive to advance a diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment. Individuals with technical, engineering, and science backgrounds, experience, or interests are particularly important for us to succeed in the industries in which we compete. In 2021, we renamed the compensation committee of the RTC Board of Directors the Human Capital & Compensation Committee and designated the committee to provide oversight of human capital management. Workforce Demographics . As of December 31, 2021, our global employee population consisted of a total of approximately 174,000 employees, including approximately 58,000 engineers and approximately 30,000 employees represented by labor unions and other employee representative bodies. Our employees are located in 54 countries, with 72% of our employees located in the U.S. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I) . We believe a work environment where all individuals are respected, valued and supported enables them to focus on developing the most innovative solutions to our industry’s greatest challenges. We have established a DE&I advisory board of senior leaders. We review diversity in talent development and promotion, employee compensation practices and succession planning, and embed DE&I training into our leadership development programs. We have nine diverse employee resource groups. We also invest in a more diverse workforce by supporting science, technology, engineering and mathematics initiatives for women and students of color, and providing opportunities and support to military veterans. As of December 31, 2021, women represented 25% of our global workforce and 30% of our global executives, and people of color represented 31% of our U.S. employee population and 17% of our U.S. executives. In addition, based on those employees who self-identified, veterans represented 12% of our U.S. employee population. Talent Acquisition, Development and Retention; Employee Health and Safety . We continuously monitor the hiring, retention and management of our employees by business and function with a focus to attract, develop, engage, advance and retain the best talent in the industry. We invest in our workforce through internal and external education, training and development programs and tuition assistance benefits. We also provide market competitive compensation and benefits. We recognize and reward performance during our annual review process. We regularly conduct succession planning to ensure that we continue to cultivate the leadership pipeline of talent needed to execute our business strategy. We solicit employee feedback on RTC’s performance as an employer via confidential surveys in the pre-hire, active and exit stages of employment, and use those results to improve our workplace and employee experience. These surveys cover various topics related to employee engagement and satisfaction. We have industry-leading health and safety programs to help maintain a safe work environment for all employees and mitigate workplace incidents, risks and hazards. We review and monitor our performance and encourage employee input to identify opportunities to reduce incidents. Moreover, we have industry-leading ethics and compliance programs to help mitigate associated employee risks. We also provide health and wellness benefits for our employees. We continue to employ safety measures in our facilities in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, require all employees to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 subject to applicable laws, and continue to enable remote working for those employees who are able. In addition, we are implementing new workplace initiatives to provide our employees with more flexibility, such as different work environment assignments (onsite, remote or hybrid), as appropriate, which will continue after the COVID-19 restrictions ease. Additional information regarding our human capital strategy is available in our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Report that can be found on our company website. Information on our website, including our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Report, is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K. For information on the risks related to our human capital resources, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K. Research and Development and Operations Our innovative products and services incorporate advanced technologies. As a result, we invest substantial amounts in research and development (R&D) activities using our own funds and under contractual arrangements with our customers, to enhance existing products and services and develop future technologies to meet our customers’ changing needs and requirements, as well as to address new business opportunities. We manufacture and service our products in over 235 manufacturing, production or overhaul facilities in approximately 30 countries, including the U.S. In addition, RTC has offices in another 9 countries. 8 Table of Contents Intellectual Property We maintain a portfolio of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, licenses and franchises related to our businesses. We rely on a combination of these rights, along with nondisclosure agreements, information technology (IT) security systems, internal controls and compliance systems and other measures to protect our intellectual property. The U.S. government and foreign governments have licenses to certain of our intellectual property, including certain patents, which are developed or used in the performance of government contracts. Commercial customers also have licenses to certain of our intellectual property largely in connection with the sale of our products. While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of each of our businesses, we do not believe that our business would be materially affected by the expiration of any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement. Suppliers and Raw Materials We are dependent upon the availability of materials and major components and the performance of our suppliers and subcontractors. Some of our products require relatively scarce raw materials. We generally have not experienced significant difficulties in procuring the necessary raw materials, components and other supplies for our products. However, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to negatively impact the global supply chain, as discussed above. Our inability to procure the necessary raw materials, components and other supplies for our products could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. In addition, a significant prolonged increase in inflation could negatively impact the cost of materials and components, particularly with respect to our commercial business operations within Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney. We continuously monitor potential supply chain issues and work with our suppliers and subcontractors to mitigate delays in our receipt of necessary raw materials, components and other supplies, and reduce costs, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on global supply chain. In addition, we monitor supplier liquidity and work continuously with our supply base to ensure an adequate source of supply and to reduce costs. We pursue cost reductions through a number of mechanisms, including consolidating or re-sourcing our purchases, entering long-term agreements, reducing the number of suppliers, strategic global sourcing and competitions among suppliers. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers. Like other users in the U.S., we are largely dependent upon foreign sources for certain raw materials, such as cobalt, tantalum, chromium, rhenium and nickel. We have a number of ongoing programs to manage this dependence and the accompanying risk, including long-term agreements and the conservation of materials through scrap reclamation and new manufacturing processes. In addition, in some cases, we must comply with specific procurement requirements, which may limit the suppliers and subcontractors we may utilize. Regulatory Matters Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation in the industries we serve. We deal with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, including but not limited to all of the branches of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the Department of Homeland Security. Similar government authorities exist in all of the countries in which we do business. U.S. Government Contracts. As previously discussed, the U.S. government is our largest customer, representing a substantial majority of our total defense sales. U.S. government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for convenience or for default in the event of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. In the case of a termination for convenience, we would normally be entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred, termination costs and a reasonable profit. If terminated by the government as a result of our default, we could be liable for payments made to us for undelivered goods or services, additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers. Our U.S. government contracts generally are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which sets forth policies, procedures and requirements for the acquisition of goods and services by the U.S. government; department-specific regulations that implement or supplement the FAR, such as the DoD’s Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS); and other applicable laws and regulations. These regulations impose a broad range of requirements, many of which are unique to government contracting, including various procurement, import and export, security, contract pricing and cost, contract termination and adjustment, audit and product integrity requirements. A contractor’s failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could result in reductions to the value of contracts, contract modifications or termination, cash withholds on contract payments, forfeiture of profits, and/or the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and fines, and could lead to suspension or debarment, for cause, from U.S. government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time. For further discussion of risks related to government contracting, including on-going litigation associated with U.S. government audits and investigations, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” in this Form 10-K and “Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 9 Table of Contents Commercial Aerospace Product Regulation. Our commercial aerospace products are subject to regulations by the FAA, foreign aviation administration authorities and international regulatory bodies, including on production and quality systems, airworthiness and installation approvals, repair procedures and continuing operational safety. In addition, commercial aerospace regulations and regulator approaches differ across jurisdictions and changes in such regulations and implementing legislation can impact our operations. Environmental Regulation. Our operations are subject to and affected by environmental regulation by federal, state and local authorities in the U.S. and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our international operations, including with respect to the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We use hazardous substances and generate hazardous wastes in some of our operations and have incurred, and will likely continue to incur, costs associated with environmental compliance activities and management of remediation matters at sites with pollutants. A portion of these costs are eligible for future recovery through the pricing of our products and services under our contracts with the U.S. government. In addition, we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act, also known as the Superfund law, or state law counterparts to the Superfund law, for a number of sites. The nature and extent of environmental concerns vary from site to site and our share of responsibility varies from sole responsibility to very little responsibility. We also manage various government-owned facilities on behalf of the U.S. government. At such facilities, environmental compliance and remediation costs have historically been primarily the responsibility of the U.S. government, and we have relied (and continue to rely consistent with best practices) upon the U.S. government funding to pay such costs. We do not anticipate that compliance with current provisions or requirements relating to the protection of the environment or that any payments we may be required to make for cleanup liabilities will have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Environmental matters are further addressed in “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” and “Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Most of the U.S. laws governing environmental matters include criminal provisions. If we were convicted of a violation of the federal Clean Air Act or Clean Water Act, the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be deemed ineligible to be used in performing any U.S. government contract we are awarded until the Environmental Protection Agency thereafter certifies that the condition giving rise to the violation has been corrected. In addition, we could be affected by future foreign or domestic laws or regulations imposed in response to concerns over climate change. Changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures, including increased energy and raw materials costs. For further discussion of risks related to environmental and climate matters and other government regulations, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K. Other Applicable Regulations. We conduct our businesses through subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide. As a result, our businesses and operations are subject to both U.S. and non-U.S. government laws, regulations and procurement policies and practices, including regulations relating to import-export controls, tariffs, taxes, investment, exchange controls, anti-corruption, and cash repatriation. Our international sales are also subject to varying currency, political and economic risks. 10 Table of Contents Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results This Form 10-K contains statements which, to the extent they are not statements of historical or present fact, constitute “forward-looking statements” under the securities laws.

RISK FACTORS Our business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity can be impacted by the factors set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. INDUSTRY RISKS Our Business May be Adversely Affected by Changes in Global Economic, Capital Market and Political Conditions. Our business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions and geopolitical risks, including credit market conditions, the inflationary environment in the United States and internationally, levels of consumer and business confidence, commodity prices, supply chain challenges, exchange rates, potential changes in policy positions or priorities, levels of government spending and deficits, the availability and cost of labor, the threat environment, trade policies, political conditions, actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt, and other challenges that could affect the global economy. Given the current inflationary pressures both in the U.S. and in other countries in which we operate, we have and may continue to experience labor and material cost increases at a rate higher than what we have experienced in recent years. Due to the nature of our government and commercial aerospace businesses, and the customer and supplier contracts within those businesses, we may not be able to increase our contract value or pricing to offset these cost increases, in particular on our fixed price contracts. Our operating profits and margins under our contracts could be adversely affected by these factors, particularly if the current inflationary pressures are prolonged. Similarly, expected increases in interest rates from recent historical lows in the U.S. and in other countries in which we operate could negatively impact financial markets and tighten the availability of, and increase the cost of capital for the Company, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity . Tightening of credit in financial markets also could adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations, could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services, and could impact the ability of our customers to make payments. Similarly, such tightening of credit may adversely affect our supplier base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy. In addition, geopolitical risks could affect government priorities, budgets and policies, which could impact sales of defense and other products and services. Our global business is also adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity, such as decreases in business and consumer spending, air travel, the financial strength of airlines and business jet operators, and government procurement. The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic Has Affected and Continues to Affect Our Business, Supply Chain, Operations and the Industries in which We Operate. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected our business, supply chains, operations and the industries in which we operate. As a result of COVID-19, governments, businesses and individuals have taken actions such as instituting lockdowns, quarantines, border closings and other travel restrictions and requirements, adopting remote working and reducing business and leisure travel, which collectively led to an unprecedented decline in demand for commercial air travel. The unprecedented decrease in air travel adversely affected our airline and airframer customers and their demand for our products and services. Aircraft manufacturers reduced production rates and cancelled new airframer programs, and, as a result, demand for our original equipment manufacturer (OEM) products decreased. In addition, significant declines in aircraft flight hours resulted in reduced demand for our aftermarket parts and services. Airlines and airline leasing companies deferred maintenance services and delayed and cancelled aircraft purchases, negatively impacting our related revenues. Some airlines accelerated retirement of certain aircraft, eliminating demand for our spare parts and our continuing aftermarket services and negatively impacting our related aftermarket revenues. A significant portion of our long-term support contracts are driven by actual usage, and therefore, our related revenues have decreased. Some airlines experienced bankruptcies, and some of our major customers were unable to make timely payment to us. As a result of these developments, we experienced goodwill impairment charges, credit losses on receivables and contract assets, and unfavorable contract adjustments, among other financial impacts, predominantly in 2020. In addition, the border closings, lockdowns and labor shortages resulting from COVID-19, as well as the continuing economic recovery, negatively impacted global supply and distribution capabilities. Decreases in the availability of supplies, increases in the cost of supplies, and delivery issues have caused shortages and delays, as well as increased costs, for the procurement of raw materials, components and other supplies required for our performance. Moreover, on September 24, 2021, in furtherance of an executive order, the U.S. Safer Federal Workforce Task Force issued guidance requiring federal contractors and subcontractors to comply with COVID-19 safety protocols, including requiring certain employees to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 except in limited circumstances. The implementation of this mandate may result in attrition, including attrition of critically skilled labor and difficulty in securing future labor needs, for our workforce, as well as the workforces of our subcontractors, suppliers and customers. The mandate is currently subject to various legal proceedings. As a result, the impact of mandate on our operations and performance, as well as on our subcontractors, suppliers and customers, is uncertain. However, if ultimately required, the mandate could affect our performance on contracts, particularly due to disruptions in subcontractor or supplier performance or deliveries, and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We also experienced challenges from the need to protect employee health and safety, workplace disruptions and restrictions on the movement of people and goods as a result of COVID-19. The global economic, supply and demand uncertainties caused by COVID-19 remain. In 2021, new COVID-19 13 Table of Contents variants emerged and caused additional outbreaks, and there were issues related to availability, distribution and acceptance of vaccines against COVID-19. Commercial air traffic demand, while improving in certain areas, has not recovered to pre-pandemic levels, and the timing of any such recovery remains uncertain. Due to the continued effects of COVID-19 and related uncertainty, we expect to continue to experience the challenges described above for an uncertain period of time into the future. In addition, due to the uncertain nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may face new challenges in the future that we had not experienced previously. For example, we provide aircraft financing commitments, in the form of debt or lease financing, to commercial aerospace customers, who might experience a greater need to utilize our commitments due to the lasting impacts of COVID-19. If one or more customers exercise financing commitments, we will need to divert cash to satisfy them, and these customers may be unable to make payments on a timely basis, or at all. Our customers may also experience decreases in production or delays if they fail to comply or lose personnel as a result of existing or new vaccine mandates, which could decrease demand for our products and services. Moreover, if developments in the COVID-19 pandemic cause significant portions of our workforce or our suppliers’ workforces to be unable to work effectively – due to facilities closures, illness, quarantines, government actions including new or continuing government-mandated safety protocols or other restrictions – such business disruptions could hinder or delay our production capabilities, could otherwise impede our ability to perform on our obligations to our customers, and may also result in increased costs to us. Developments in the COVID-19 pandemic may affect our ability to hire, develop and retain our talented and diverse workforce, and to maintain our corporate culture. We continue to conduct talent searches for fully vaccinated replacements for positions vacated due to the vaccine mandate, and it is critical that we find and train new qualified personnel. The COVID-19 pandemic also may materially impact U.S. government sales, including changes or shifts in defense spending due to budgetary constraints, the allocation of funds to governmental responses to COVID-19, a failure to complete the government budget process resulting in a Continuing Resolution (CR) or a government shutdown, or otherwise, and uncertain funding of programs. COVID-19 has impacted and may further impact the broader economies of affected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth, and creating volatility and unpredictability in financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. These impacts and the resulting volatility and disruption to the global capital markets may increase the cost of capital and may adversely impact access to short-term and long-term capital for the Company and our suppliers and customers including heightened counter party risks associated with foreign exchange hedging transactions, interest rate swaps and solvency of revolving credit facility banks. Any of these factors, depending on the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The ultimate duration and financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown at this time. The extent of such impact depends on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted in the short- or long-term, including new information which may emerge concerning the scope, severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as any worsening of the pandemic, the effect of additional variants and whether additional outbreaks of the pandemic will continue to occur, the efficacy, acceptance, distribution and availability of vaccines, new or continued actions to contain the pandemic’s spread or treat its impact, and governmental, business and individual personal actions taken in response to the pandemic (including restrictions and limitations on travel and transportation, and changes in leisure and business travel patterns and work environments) among others. Some of these actions and related impacts may be trends that continue in the future even after the pandemic no longer poses a significant public health risk. Changes in U.S. Government Defense Spending Could Negatively Impact Our Financial Position, Results of Operations, Liquidity and Overall Business. U.S. government sales constitute a significant portion of our consolidated sales. Our U.S. government revenues largely result from contracts awarded under various U.S. government programs, primarily defense-related programs with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), and a broad range of programs with the U.S. Intelligence Community and other departments and agencies. Changes in U.S. government defense spending for various reasons, including as a result of potential changes in policy positions or priorities, could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our programs are subject to U.S. government policies, budget decisions and appropriation processes which are driven by numerous factors including: (1) geopolitical events; (2) macroeconomic conditions; and (3) the ability of the U.S. government to enact relevant legislation, such as appropriations bills. In recent years, U.S. government appropriations have been affected by larger U.S. government budgetary issues and related legislation, and the U.S. government has been unable to complete its budget process before the end of its fiscal year, resulting in both governmental shutdowns and CRs providing only enough funds for U.S. government agencies to continue operating at prior-year levels. Further, if the U.S. government debt ceiling is not raised and the national debt reaches the statutory debt ceiling, the U.S. government could default on its debts. As a result, U.S. government defense spending levels are subject to a wide range of outcomes and are difficult to predict beyond the near-term due to numerous factors, including the external threat environment, future governmental priorities and the state of 14 Table of Contents governmental finances. Significant changes in U.S. government defense spending or changes in U.S. government priorities, policies and requirements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We Face Risks Relating to Our U.S. Government Contracts and the Mix of Our U.S. Government Contracts and Programs that Could Negatively Impact our Financial Condition, Results of Operations, Liquidity and Overall Business. The termination of one or more of our contracts, or the occurrence of performance delays, cost overruns, product failures, materials or components shortages, or contract definitization delays, could negatively impact our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. U.S. government contracts generally permit the government to terminate the contract, in whole or in part, without prior notice, at the U.S. government’s convenience or for default based on performance. If one of our contracts is terminated for convenience, we would generally be entitled to payments for our allowable costs and would receive some allowance for profit on the work performed. If one of our contracts is terminated for default, we would generally be entitled to payments for work accepted by the U.S. government. A termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future contracts and orders. In addition, we are a subcontractor on some contracts and the U.S. government could terminate the prime contract for convenience or otherwise, without regard to our performance as a subcontractor. We can give no assurance that we would be awarded new U.S. government contracts to offset the revenues lost as a result of the termination of any of our contracts. In addition, because the funding of U.S. government programs is subject to congressional appropriations made on a fiscal year basis even for multi-year programs, programs are often only partially funded initially and may not continue to be funded in future years. Appropriation bills may be delayed, which may result in delays to funding, the collection of receivables and our contract performance due to lack of authorized funds to procure related products and services. Under certain circumstances, we may use our own funds to meet our customer’s desired delivery dates or other requirements, but we may not be reimbursed. Further, if appropriations for one of our programs become unavailable, reduced or delayed, the U.S. government may terminate for convenience our contract or subcontract under that program. In addition, our U.S. government contracts typically involve the development, application and manufacture of advanced defense and technology systems and products aimed at achieving challenging goals. New technologies may be untested or unproven and in some instances, product requirements or specifications may be modified. As a result, we may experience technological and other performance difficulties, which may result in delays, setbacks, cost overruns or product failures, and could divert our attention or resources from other projects. Our failure to execute effectively on our development programs could impact our future sales opportunities. Additionally, in order to win certain U.S. government contracts, we may be required to invest in development prior to award as our customers demand more mature and proven solutions. These additional investments may not be worthwhile if we are not chosen for these awards. Our U.S. government contracts are typically either fixed-priced contracts or cost reimbursement contracts. Fixed-price contracts are predominantly either firm fixed-price (FFP) contracts or fixed-price incentive (FPI) contracts. Under FFP contracts, we receive a fixed price irrespective of the actual costs we incur and we therefore carry the burden of any cost overruns. Under FPI contracts, we generally share with the U.S. government savings for cost underruns less than target costs and expenses for cost overruns exceeding target costs up to a negotiated ceiling price. We carry the entire burden of cost overruns exceeding the ceiling price amount under FPI contracts. Under cost reimbursable contracts, we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fixed or performance-based fee, but we are generally not reimbursed for unauthorized costs exceeding a cost ceiling amount or costs not allowable under the contract or applicable regulations. If we are unable to control costs or if our initial cost estimates are incorrect, our profitability could be negatively affected, particularly under fixed-price development contracts. We may also experience cost underruns which would reduce contract value and related expected revenues, and we may be unable to expand the contract scope or secure additional work to offset the resulting lost revenues. While contracts for development programs with complex design and technical challenges are typically cost reimbursable, they can be FFP or FPI, which can significantly increase our risk of a potential negative profit adjustment, as development contracts by nature involve elements that have not been undertaken before and, thus, are highly subject to future unexpected cost growth. In addition, other contracts in backlog are for the transition from development to production, which includes starting and stabilizing a manufacturing and test line while the final design is still being validated. Moreover, over the past several years, the DoD has increased its use of Other Transaction Authority (OTA) contracts, under which it awards certain prototypes, research and production contracts without all of the procurement requirements that typically apply to DoD contracts, including justification of sole source awards. OTAs may use fixed-price contracts during all phases of the contract, or mandated contract cost sharing (e.g., one-third of program costs). They may also require non-traditional subcontractor participation and impose other requirements that differ from our other DoD contracts. Our business may be negatively impacted if we are unable to perform on our OTA contracts, including any applicable non-traditional requirements. Moreover, from time to time, we may begin performance under an undefinitized contract action with a not-to-exceed price prior to completing contract negotiations in order to support U.S. government priorities. Uncertainties in final contract price, specifications and terms, or loss of negotiating leverage associated with particularly long delays in contract definitization, may negatively affect our profitability. In addition, as discussed more fully below, our U.S. government contracts also require us to comply with extensive and evolving procurement rules and regulations and subject us to potential U.S. government audits, investigations, and disputes. We are also involved in programs that are classified by the U.S. 15 Table of Contents government, which have security requirements that place limits on our ability to discuss our performance on these programs, including any risks, disputes and claims. Our International Operations Subject Us to Economic Risk As Our Results of Operations and Liquidity May Be Adversely Affected by Changes in Foreign Currency Fluctuations, Economic Conditions, Political Factors, Trade Policies, Sales Methods, and Changes in Local Government Regulation. We conduct our business on a global basis, with a significant portion of sales derived from international operations, including U.S. export sales. Changes in local and regional economic conditions, including fluctuations in exchange rates, may affect product demand and reported profits in our non-U.S. operations where transactions may be denominated in local currencies. In addition, currency fluctuations may affect the prices we pay suppliers for materials used in our products. As a result, our operating margins also may be negatively impacted by worldwide currency fluctuations that result in higher costs for certain cross-border transactions. In addition, a strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against other major foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations. Our financial statements are denominated in U.S. Dollars, and exchange rate fluctuations may cause translation gains or losses when translating non-U.S. operating unit financial statements. In addition, the majority of our commercial aerospace business sales are transacted in U.S. Dollars, while the majority of costs outside the U.S. are incurred in the applicable local currency; therefore, fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar against the local currency could impact our results of operations. Pratt & Whitney Canada is especially susceptible to fluctuations in exchange rates for this reason. To manage certain exposures, we employ long-term hedging strategies associated with U.S. Dollar sales. Our international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with local government laws, regulations and policies, including those related to tariffs, import quotas and other trade barriers, investments, taxation, exchange controls, capital controls, employment regulations, and cash repatriation. Our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities, including government budgets, as well as to regional and local political and economic factors, including volatility in energy prices, political or civil unrest, changes in threat environments and political relations, geopolitical uncertainties, and changes in U.S. foreign policy. Government policies on international trade and investments, whether adopted by individual governments or regional trade blocs, can affect demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products, impact our supply, and prevent us from being able to manufacture or sell products in certain countries. The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs, or the renegotiation of existing trade agreements by the U.S. or by countries where we sell large quantities of products and services or procure supplies of materials or components could negatively affect us. Ongoing geopolitical uncertainty and trends such as populism and economic nationalism, a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies, or a government’s limiting exports of a unique material, such as rare earth minerals, over which it controls a significant portion of the global supply, or retaliation by another government against any such policies, such as tariffs, could negatively affect us. Further, regime change in a major customer’s government could decrease or eliminate its demand for our products and services, as well as adversely affect our supply of materials or components from that county. International transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs and contract laws and regulations, and include contractual terms that differ from those of similar contracts in the U.S. or that may be interpreted differently in foreign countries. As discussed more fully below, our international sales also require us to comply with U.S. laws, regulations and policies, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), and other anti-corruption, sanctions, and export laws and regulations. In addition, in certain foreign countries, our businesses engage non-employee sales representatives. Our use of and association with third-party foreign representatives and consultants for international sales and teaming with international subcontractors, partners and suppliers in connection with international programs expose us to various challenges including risks associated with the FCPA and local antibribery laws and regulations. From time to time, we have disputes with such representatives regarding claimed commissions and other matters which can result in litigation or arbitration. In addition, we face risks related to the unintended or unauthorized use of our products. We conduct business in numerous countries that carry high levels of currency, political, compliance and economic risk. We expect that sales to customers in these countries will continue to account for a significant portion of our commercial aerospace sales as our businesses evolve and as these and other developing nations and regions around the world increase their demand for our products, particularly our aerospace products. Operations in emerging market countries can present many risks, including volatility in gross domestic product and rates of economic growth, economic and government instability (particularly in certain Middle East countries) cultural differences (such as employment and business practices), the imposition of exchange and capital controls, and risks associated with exporting components manufactured in those countries for incorporation into finished products completed in other countries. While these factors and their impact are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Of note, in 2019 the U.S. government suspended Turkey’s participation in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program because Turkey accepted delivery of the Russian-built S-400 air and missile defense system. The U.S. has imposed, and may impose additional, sanctions on Turkey, as well as contractual restrictions on the use of Turkish sources for certain military programs, as a result of this or other political disputes. Turkish companies supply components, some of which are sole-sourced, to our aerospace 16 Table of Contents businesses for commercial and military engines and aerospace products, as well as to our defense businesses. Depending upon the scope and timing of U.S. sanctions or contractual prohibitions on Turkey and potential reciprocal actions, if any, such sanctions or actions could impact our sources of supply and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. In addition, in October 2020, the People’s Republic of China (China) announced that it may sanction RTC in connection with a Foreign Military Sale to Taiwan of six MS-110 Reconnaissance Pods and related equipment manufactured by Collins Aerospace. Foreign Military Sales are government-to-government transactions that are initiated by, and carried out at the direction of, the U.S. government. To date, the Chinese government has not imposed sanctions on RTC or indicated the nature or timing of any future potential sanctions or other actions. If China were to impose sanctions or take other regulatory action against RTC, our suppliers, affiliates or partners, it could potentially disrupt our business operations. The impact of potential sanctions or other actions by China cannot be determined at this time. From time to time, our businesses have sold, and are expected to sell in the future additional defense products to Taiwan and we are unable to determine the potential impact, if any, of any future sanctions or other actions by China in response to these sales. Moreover, the Chinese government has generally expanded its ability to restrict China-related import, export and investment activities, which may have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct business or sell our commercial aerospace products in China. In addition, in connection with the current status of international relations with Russia, particularly in light of potential conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the U.S. government has stated it is considering imposing enhanced export controls on certain products and sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia. The governments of other jurisdictions in which we operate, such as the European Union and Canada, may also implement sanctions or other restrictive measures. These potential sanctions and export controls, as well as any responses from Russia, could adversely affect the Company and/or our supply chain, business partners or customers. Our international business faces substantial competition from both U.S. companies and foreign companies. In some instances, foreign companies may be owned by foreign governments or may receive loans, marketing subsidies and other assistance from their governments that may not be available to U.S. companies or our foreign subsidiaries. In addition, foreign companies may be subject to fewer restrictions on technology transfer than U.S. companies. Our international contracts, particularly for sales of defense products and services, may include offset or industrial cooperation obligations requiring specific local purchases, manufacturing agreements, technology transfer agreements or financial support obligations, sometimes in the form of in-country industrial participation (ICIP) agreements. Approvals of offset or ICIP thresholds and requirements may be subjective and time-consuming and may delay contract awards. Offset and ICIP requirements may, in certain countries, include the creation of a joint venture with a local company that may control the venture. Certain customers’ demands are increasing for greater offset or ICIP commitment levels, higher-value content, including the transfer of technologies and capabilities, and local production and economic development. As a result of the above factors, we could experience financial penalties and award and funding delays on international programs, our profitability on these programs could be negatively affected, and we could incur losses on these programs that could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our Financial Performance Is Dependent on the Condition of the Aerospace Industry. Our aerospace businesses constitute a substantial portion of our financial results, and the performance of those businesses is directly tied to economic conditions in the commercial aerospace industry, which is cyclical in nature. Capital spending and demand for aircraft engines, aerospace products and component aftermarket parts and services by commercial airlines, lessors, other aircraft operators and aircraft manufacturers are influenced by a wide variety of factors, including current and predicted traffic levels, load factors, aircraft fuel prices, labor issues, airline profits, airline consolidation, bankruptcies and restructuring activities, competition, the retirement of older aircraft, regulatory changes, terrorism and related safety concerns, general economic conditions, corporate profitability, cost reduction efforts and remaining performance obligations levels. In particular, tightening of credit in financial markets could adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations, could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services, and could impact the ability of our customers to make payments. Similarly, such tightening of credit may adversely affect our supplier base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy. Any of these factors could reduce the sales and margins of our aerospace businesses. Other factors, including future terrorist actions, aviation safety concerns, pandemic health issues or major natural disasters, could also dramatically reduce the demand for commercial air travel, which could negatively impact the sales and margins of our aerospace businesses. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted, and continues to impact, our business, as described above. Additionally, because a substantial portion of product deliveries to commercial aerospace customers are scheduled for delivery beyond 2022, changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled. At times, our aerospace businesses also enter into firm fixed-price or cost-share development contracts with commercial customers, which may require us to bear cost overruns related to unforeseen technical and design challenges that arise during the development and early production stages of the program. In addition, our aerospace businesses face intense competition from domestic and foreign manufacturers of new equipment, and 17 Table of Contents approved non-OEM aftermarket spare parts and repairs. Spare parts sales and aftermarket service trends are affected by similar factors, including usage, pricing, technological improvements, regulatory changes and the retirement of older aircraft. Furthermore, because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing products in these business segments to market, we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is ready to enter into service. A reduction in spending in the commercial aviation industry could have a significant effect on the demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. We Design, Manufacture and Service Products that Incorporate Advanced Technologies; The Introduction of New Products and Technologies Involves Risks and We May Not Realize the Degree or Timing of Benefits Initially Anticipated; Competition May Reduce Our Revenues and Segment Share and Limit Our Future Opportunities. We seek to achieve growth through the design, development, production, sale and support of innovative commercial aerospace and defense systems and products that incorporate advanced technologies. The product, program and service needs of our customers change and evolve regularly, and we invest substantial amounts in research and development efforts to pursue advancements in a wide range of technologies, products and services. Of particular note, Pratt & Whitney is currently producing and delivering the Geared Turbofan engine to power various aircraft. The level of orders received for the Geared Turbofan family of engines, coupled with a requirement to achieve mature production levels in a very short time frame, require significant additional manufacturing and supply chain capacity. If any of our production ramp-up efforts are delayed, if suppliers cannot timely deliver or perform to our standards, and/or if we identify or experience issues with in-service engines, we may not meet customers’ delivery schedules, which could result in material additional costs, including liquidated damages or other liabilities that could be assessed under existing contracts. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our technological advancements depends on a variety of factors, including meeting development, production, certification and regulatory approval schedules; receiving regulatory approvals; execution of internal and external performance plans; availability of supplier and internally produced parts and materials; performance of suppliers and subcontractors; availability of supplier and internal facility capacity to perform maintenance, repair and overhaul services on our products; hiring and training of qualified personnel; achieving cost and production efficiencies; identification of emerging technological trends for our target end-customers (such as sustainable technologies, as described below); validation of innovative technologies; risks associated with the development of complex software; the level of customer interest in new technologies and products; and customer acceptance of products we manufacture or that incorporate technologies we develop. For example, our customers manufacture end products and larger aerospace systems that incorporate certain of our aerospace products. These systems and end products may also incorporate additional technologies manufactured by third parties and involve additional risks and uncertainties. As a result, the performance and industry acceptance of these larger systems and end products could affect the level of customer interest in and acceptance of our products in the marketplace. In addition, many of our products must adhere to strict regulatory and market-driven safety and performance standards in a variety of jurisdictions. The evolving nature of these standards, along with the long duration of development, production and aftermarket support programs, creates uncertainty regarding program profitability, particularly with our aircraft engine products. Development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses, and these efforts may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings. In addition, the industries for our products or products that incorporate our technologies may not develop or grow as we anticipate. We or our customers, suppliers or subcontractors may encounter difficulties in developing and producing new products and services, and may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated or may otherwise suffer significant adverse financial consequences. Due to the design complexity of our products or those of our customers or third party manufacturers that incorporate our products into theirs or our customers’ products, we may experience delays in completing the development and introduction of new products or we may experience the suspension of production after these products enter into service due to safety concerns. Delays and/or suspension of production could result in increased development costs or deflect resources from other projects. In particular, we cannot predict with certainty whether, when and in what quantities our aerospace businesses will produce and sell aircraft engines, aircraft systems and components, and other products currently in development, pending required certifications or after entry into service. We operate in highly competitive industries and our competitors may have more extensive or more specialized engineering, manufacturing, marketing and servicing capabilities than we do. Our contracts are typically awarded on a competitive basis. Our bids are based upon, among other items, the cost to provide the products and services. To generate an acceptable return on our investment in these contracts, we must be able to accurately estimate our costs to provide the services and deliver the products and to be able to complete the contracts in a timely manner. If we fail to accurately estimate our costs or the time required to complete a contract, the profitability of our contracts may be materially and adversely affected. Some of our contracts provide for liquidated damages in the event that we are unable to perform and deliver in accordance with the contractual specifications and schedule. In addition, we may face customer-directed cost reduction targets that could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our contracts if these targets are not achieved when required. Moreover, we have seen highly competitive pricing, in which a bidder may anticipate making a substantial investment in a program in order to win 18 Table of Contents the work. In addition, with respect to DoD awards in particular, bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards are frequent. Generally, a bid protest will delay the start of contract activities, delay earnings, and could result in the award decision being overturned and require a re-bid of the contract. Highly competitive activity within the commercial aerospace industry has included substantial discounts and other financial incentives, performance and operating cost guarantees, and participation in financing arrangements, in order to secure both new engine business and the aftermarket revenues associated with these products. Furthermore, our competitors, including our customers, may develop competing technologies which gain industry acceptance in advance of or instead of our products, or meet particular in-demand technological needs before us or with technology that is superior to our existing or new technologies. For example, the enhanced focus on climate change has increased demand for more environmentally sustainable products and services, as described below. Our competitors may develop sustainable products or services that are available to our customers before our products or services, or that are adopted more readily than our products or services. In addition, our competitors or customers might develop new technologies or offerings that might cause our existing technologies and offerings to become obsolete or otherwise decrease demand for our offerings. In addition, the possibility exists that competitors or customers will develop aftermarket services and aftermarket parts for our products that attract customers and adversely impact our return on investment on new products. We also anticipate companies continuing to enhance their competitive position against our defense businesses as a result of continued domestic and cross-border defense industry consolidation and the expansion of competitors’ capabilities throughout the supply chain through vertical integration. We are also facing heightened competition domestically and internationally from foreign and multinational firms. Additionally, some customers, including the DoD, are increasingly turning to commercial contractors, rather than traditional defense contractors, for information technology and other support work. If we are unable to continue to compete successfully against our current or future competitors in our core businesses, we may experience declines in revenues and industry segment share. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. OPERATIONAL RISKS We Use a Variety of Raw Materials, Supplier-Provided Parts, Components, Sub-Systems and Contract Manufacturing Services, and Significant Shortages, Capacity Constraints, Production Disruptions or Price Increases Could Increase Our Operating Costs and Adversely Impact the Competitive Positions of Our Products. Our reliance on U.S. and non-U.S. suppliers (including third-party manufacturing suppliers, subcontractors and service providers) and commodity markets to secure raw materials, parts, components and sub-systems used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials and services. In many instances, we depend upon a single source of supply, manufacturing, services support or assembly, or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers. Our defense businesses are subject to specific procurement requirements that limit the types of materials they use, which may further limit the suppliers and subcontractors they may utilize. They also must require suppliers to comply with various DoD cybersecurity requirements. A disruption in deliveries from our suppliers, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions, supplier quality issues (such as issues with defects or fraudulent parts), closing, bankruptcy or financial difficulties of our suppliers, price increases due to inflation or otherwise, or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities, including as a result of war, natural disaster, health pandemic or other business continuity events, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. We believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. Nonetheless, price increases, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions or the unavailability of some raw materials may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted, and continues to impact, our supply chain, as described above. Due to the Nature of Our Products and Services, a Product Safety Failure or Other Failure Affecting Our or Our Customers’ or Suppliers’ Products or Systems Could Seriously Harm Our Business. Our products and services are highly sophisticated and specialized, involve complex advanced technologies, are often integrated with third-party products and services and are utilized for specific purposes that require precision, reliability and durability. Many of our products and services include both hardware and software that involve industrial machinery and intricate aviation and defense systems, including commercial and military jet engines, power and control systems and other aircraft parts, air and missile defense systems, and military sensors and command and control systems. Technical, mechanical and other failures may occur from time to time, whether as a result of manufacturing or design def ect, operational process or production issue attributable to us, our customers, suppliers, third party integrators or others. In addition, our products could fail as a result of cyber-attacks, such as those that seize control and result in misuse or unintended use of our products, or other intentional acts. The impact of a catastrophic product or system failure or similar event affecting our or our customers’ or suppliers’ products or services c ould be significant, and could result in injuries or death, property damage, loss of strategic capabilities, loss of intellectual property, loss of reputation, and other significant negative effects. A product or system failure could lead to negative publicity, a diversion of management attention and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services. It 19 Table of Contents could also result in product recalls and product liability and warranty claims (including claims related to the safety or reliability of our products) and related expenses, other service, repair and maintenance costs, significant damages and other costs, including fines and other remedies and regulatory and environmental liabilities. We may also incur increased costs, delayed payments, reputational harm or lost equipment or services revenue in connection with a significant issue with a third party’s product with which our products are integrated. Further, our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all related costs and we may not otherwise be fully indemnified for them. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Exports and Imports of Certain of Our Products are Subject to Various Export Control, Sanctions and Import Regulations and May Require Authorization from Regulatory Agencies o f the U.S. or Other Countries. We must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the export and import of products, services and technology from and into the U.S. and other countries having jurisdiction over our operations. In the U.S., these laws and regulations include, among others, the EAR administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the ITAR administered by the U.S. Department of State, embargoes and sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and import regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Department of Justice. Certain of our products, services and technologies have military or strategic applications and are on the U.S. Munitions List of the ITAR and the Commerce Control List of the EAR or are otherwise subject to the EAR, or on the U.S. Munitions Import List and we are required to obtain licenses and authorizations from the appropriate U.S. government agencies before selling these products outside of the U.S. or importing these products into the U.S. U.S. foreign policy or foreign policy of other licensing jurisdictions may affect the licensing process or otherwise prevent us from engaging in business dealings with certain individuals, entities or countries. Any failure by us, our customers or our suppliers to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal penalties, fines, seizure of our products, adverse publicity, restrictions on our ability to export or import our products, or the suspension or debarment from doing business with the U.S. government. Moreover, any changes in export control, sanctions or import regulations may further restrict the export of our products or services, and the possibility of such changes requires constant monitoring to ensure we remain compliant. Our ability to obtain required licenses and authorizations on a timely basis or at all is subject to risks and uncertainties, including changing U.S. government foreign policies or laws, delays in Congressional action, or geopolitical and other factors. If we are not successful in obtaining or maintaining the necessary licenses or authorizations in a timely manner, our sales relating to those approvals may be prevented or delayed, and revenue and profit previously recognized may be reversed. Any restrictions on the export or import of our products or product lines could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. We Depend On the Recruitment and Retention of Qualified Personnel, and Our Failure to Attract, Train and Retain Such Personnel and to Maintain our Corporate Culture and High Ethical Standards Could Seriously Harm Our Business. Due to the specialized nature of our business, our future performance is highly dependent upon the continued services of our key technical personnel and executive officers, the development of additional management personnel, and the hiring of new qualified technical, manufacturing, marketing, sales and management personnel for our operations. Our defense business in particular requires qualified personnel with security clearances due to our classified programs. Competition for personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting, training or retaining qualified personnel with the requisite skills or security clearances. In addition, certain existing personnel may be required to receive various security clearances and substantial training in order to work on certain programs or perform certain tasks. Necessary security clearances may be delayed, which may impact our ability to perform on our U.S. government contracts. Further, we have experienced and may continue to experience personnel reductions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on our business. In addition, a significant percentage of our current workforce is nearing or eligible for retirement. To the extent that we lose experienced personnel, it is critical that we develop other employees, hire new qualified personnel and successfully manage the transfer of critical knowledge. In addition, new qualified personnel may have different expectations from our current workforce, which could result in difficulties attracting and retaining new employees. Loss of key employees, increased attrition for various reasons, failure to attract new qualified employees or adequately train them, delays in receiving required security clearances, or delays in hiring key personnel could seriously harm our business. Moreover, we believe that a critical element of our ability to successfully attract, train and retain qualified personnel is our corporate culture, which we believe fosters innovation, collaboration, diversity and inclusion, and a focus on execution, all in an environment of high ethical standards. Our global operations may present challenges in maintaining these important aspects of our corporate culture. Any failure to maintain these elements of our corporate culture could negatively impact our ability to attract, train and retain essential qualified personnel who are vital to our business and the value of our company. Further, we rely on our key personnel to lead with integrity and to meet our high ethical standards that promote excellent performance and cultivate diversity, equity and inclusion. To the extent any of our key personnel were to behave in a way that is inconsistent with our values, including with respect to product safety or quality, legal or regulatory compliance, financial reporting or people management, we could experience a materially adverse impact to our reputation and our operating results. 20 Table of Contents Our Business and Financial Performance May Be Adversely Affected by Cyber-attacks on Information Technology Infrastructure and Products. Our business may be impacted by disruptions to our own or third-party information technology (IT) infrastructure, which could result from, among other causes, cyber-attacks on or failures of such infrastructure or compromises to its physical security. We also encounter attempts to infiltrate our products and services and sabotage or disable their use by our customers. Cybersecurity threats are evolving and include, but are not limited to, both attacks on our IT infrastructure and attacks on the IT infrastructure of our customers, suppliers, subcontractors and other third parties with whom we do business routinely, both on premises and in the cloud, attempting to gain unauthorized access to our confidential or other proprietary information, classified information, or information relating to our employees, customers and other third parties, or to disrupt our systems or the systems of third parties. Cybersecurity threats also include attacks targeting the security, integrity and/or availability of the hardware, software and information installed, stored or transmitted in our products, including after the purchase of those products and when they are incorporated into third-party products, facilities or infrastructure, and insider threat attacks. Such attacks could disrupt our systems or those of third parties (including mission critical systems), impact business operations, result in unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, and corrupt our data or that of third parties. We have experienced cyber-based attacks, and due to the evolving threat landscape, may continue to experience them going forward, potentially with more frequency. The threats we face vary from attacks common to most industries to more advanced and persistent, highly organized adversaries, including nation states, which target us and other defense contractors. We continue to make investments and adopt measures designed to enhance our protection, detection, response, and recovery capabilities, and to mitigate potential risks to our technology, products, services and operations from potential cybersecurity threats. However, given the unpredictability, nature and scope of cyber-attacks, it is possible that we are unable to prevent cyber attacks, that potential vulnerabilities could go undetected for an extended period, that we may be unsuccessful in defending an attack against those vulnerabilities, or that we may otherwise be unable to mitigate customer losses and other potential consequences of these attacks. In addition, some products and services that we provide to customers, particularly those related to public security, may raise potential liabilities related to privacy and intellectual property. In some cases we must rely on the safeguards put in place by our customers, suppliers, subcontractors and other third parties to protect against and report cyber threats. We could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromise of confidential information, intellectual property or otherwise protected information, misappropriation, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our or third-party systems, networks or products, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business, or potential liability, penalties, fines and/or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Some of these risks may be heightened due to the Company and its suppliers and other third parties operating with a significant number of employees working remotely. Due to the evolving nature of such risks, the impact of any potential incident cannot be predicted. Further, our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all related costs and we may not otherwise be fully indemnified for them. Our Business and Financial Performance May Be Adversely Affected By Threats to Our Physical Security and Other Events Outside Our Control. We could encounter threats to our physical security, including our facilities and personnel, and threats from, workplace violence, civil unrest, terrorism or similar acts, any of which could disrupt our business. In addition, our business, and the businesses of our suppliers, subcontractors and service providers and customers, could be disrupted by public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, damaging weather or other acts of nature, cyber-attacks on IT infrastructure and products or other events outside of our control. For example, our business has been, and continues to be, impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as discussed above. Any such business disruption could subject us to production downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, financial losses from remedial actions, the diversion of management’s attention and resources, or loss of business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. The impact of any such business disruption is difficult to predict. We Depend On Our Intellectual Property, and Have Access to Certain Intellectual Property and Information of Our Customers and Suppliers; Infringement or Failure to Protect Our Intellectual Property Could Adversely Affect Our Future Growth and Success. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements, IT security systems, internal controls and compliance systems and other measures to protect our intellectual property. We also rely on nondisclosure agreements, confidentiality obligations in contracts, IT security systems and other measures to protect certain customer and supplier information and intellectual property that we have in our possession or to which we have access. The U.S. government and foreign governments have licenses under certain of our intellectual property, including certain patents, which are developed or used in performance of government contracts. Governments may use or authorize others (including our competitors) to use such patents and intellectual property for government and other purposes. Governments may challenge the sufficiency of intellectual property rights we have granted in government contracts and attempt to obtain greater rights, which could reduce our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and to compete. In some instances, we have augmented our 21 Table of Contents technology base by licensing the proprietary intellectual property of others. Intellectual property obtained from third parties is also subject to challenge, invalidation, misappropriation or circumvention by third parties. In addition, we may not be able to obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms. In other instances, our ability to procure and perform government contracts requires us to obtain certain rights in the intellectual property of others through government grants. Governments may deny us the right to obtain such rights in the intellectual property of others, which may affect our ability to perform government contracts. Moreover, our efforts to protect intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient. We cannot be sure that our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents to us, that patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to preclude our competitors from introducing technologies similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the U.S. In addition, we may be the target of competitor or other third-party patent enforcement actions seeking substantial monetary damages or seeking to prevent our sale and marketing of certain of our products or services. Our competitive position also may be adversely impacted by limitations on our ability to obtain possession of, and ownership of necessary licenses concerning, data important to the development or provision of our products or service offerings, or by limitations on our ability to restrict the use by others of data related to our products or services. We may also be subject to disruptions, losses and liability resulting from various cybersecurity attacks or information technology failures, as described above. Any of these events or factors could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, subject us to judgments, penalties and significant litigation costs, or temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. LEGAL, ENVIRONMENTAL AND REGULATORY RISKS As a U.S. Government Contractor, We are Subject to Risks Relating to U.S. Government Audits, Investigations, and Disputes. We are subject to U.S. government investigations relating to our U.S. government contracts. Such U.S. government investigations often take years to complete and could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, including repayments, fines, treble and other damages, forfeitures, restitution or penalties, or could lead to suspension or debarment of U.S. government contracting or of export privileges. For instance, if we or one of our business units were charged with wrongdoing in connection with a U.S. government investigation (including fraud, or violation of certain environmental or export laws, as further described below), the U.S. government could suspend us from bidding on or receiving awards of new U.S. government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings. If convicted or found liable, the U.S. government could fine and debar us from new U.S. government contracting for a period generally not to exceed three years and could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud. We also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, even if such allegations are later determined to be unsubstantiated. Further, our U.S. government contracts are subject to audit and we have received audit reports recommending the reduction of certain contract prices because, for example, cost or pricing data disclosures or cost accounting practices used to price and negotiate those contracts may not have conformed to government regulations. Some of these audit reports recommend that certain payments be repaid, delayed, or withheld, and may involve substantial amounts, which could, if the audit reports’ theories were to prevail in litigation, also have future impacts such as increasing the costs absorbed by our commercial businesses. We have made voluntary refunds in those cases we believe appropriate, have settled some allegations and, in some cases, continue to negotiate and/or litigate. We may be, and have been, required to make payments into escrow of disputed liabilities while the related litigation is pending. If the litigation is resolved in our favor, any such payments will be returned to us with interest. The Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) and the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) also review the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies, including our accounting, purchasing, government property, estimating, earned value management and material management accounting systems. Our final allowable incurred costs for each year are subject to audit and have from time to time resulted in disputes between us and the U.S. government, including DCMA claims to recover payments for alleged noncompliance with cost accounting standards. In some cases, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has convened grand juries to investigate possible irregularities in our costs. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed by the U.S. government or must be refunded by us to the U.S. government if already reimbursed. An adverse outcome of any audit or investigation could result in civil and criminal penalties and fines, which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, if allegations of impropriety were made against us, we could suffer serious reputational harm, which could negatively affect our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. We Are Subject to Litigation, Environmental, Anti-Corruption and Other Legal and Compliance Risks. We are subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks. These risks relate to, among other things, product safety and reliability, personal injuries, intellectual property rights, contract-related claims, government contracts, taxes, environmental matters, export control, employment matters, competition laws and laws governing improper business practices. We or one of our businesses could be charged with wrongdoing as a result of such matters. If convicted or found liable, we could be subject to significant fines, penalties, repayments, or other damages (in certain cases, treble damages). Product recalls and product liability and warranty 22 Table of Contents claims can result in significant damages and costs, including fines as well as other harm to our business as discussed above. As a global business, we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the U.S. and in other countries in which we operate. Those laws and regulations may be interpreted in different ways. They may also change from time to time, as may related interpretations and other guidance. Changes in laws or regulations could result in higher expenses. Uncertainty relating to laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights. For example, changes in climate change laws or regulations could lead to increased compliance expenditures and technological development costs, as described below. We use hazardous substances and generate hazardous wastes in our operations. As a result, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to personal injuries or property damage that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures. Personal injury lawsuits may involve individual and purported class actions alleging that contaminants originating from our current or former products or operating facilities caused or contributed to medical conditions, including cancers incurred by employees, former employees, third-parties’ employees or residents in the area, and environmental damage or diminution of real estate values. For example, we are investigating and remediating contamination related to past practices at a number of properties and, in some cases, have in the past been named as a defendant in related “toxic tort” claims. We are also subject to laws and regulations that: (1) impose requirements for the proper management, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes; (2) restrict air and water emissions from our operations (including U.S. government-owned facilities we manage); and (3) require maintenance of a safe workplace. These laws and regulations can lead to substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations, and may require the installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions, decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases, and/or reduce the risks of injury to people. We incur, and expect to continue to incur, capital and other expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations. A criminal violation of certain U.S. environmental statutes such as the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act could result in suspension, debarment or disqualification by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). A facility determined to be in violation of the criminal provisions of these statutes can be prohibited from performing any U.S. government contract work until the violation has been corrected and the EPA approves the reinstatement of the facility. Even in litigation where we believe our liability is remote, there is a risk that a negative finding or decision in a matter involving multiple plaintiffs or a purported class action could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity, in particular with respect to environmental claims in regions where we have, or previously had, significant operations. In addition, new laws, regulations, or governmental policies, sudden changes in the interpretation and enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination, or the imposition of new clean-up standards could require us to incur additional costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, the FCPA and other anti-bribery and -corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to U.S. and non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. These laws apply to companies, individual directors, officers, employees and agents. U.S. companies also may be held liable for actions taken by strategic or local partners or representatives. The FCPA also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded U.S. corporations and their foreign affiliates, which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments. Certain of our customer relationships outside of the U.S. are with governmental entities and are therefore subject to the FCPA and other anti-bribery and -corruption laws, including the anti-bribery and -corruption laws of non-U.S. countries. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery and -corruption laws. Despite meaningful measures that we undertake to ensure lawful conduct, which include training and internal control policies, these measures may not always prevent violations of the FCPA or similar laws. We have been subject to regulatory investigations for alleged violations of anti-bribery and -corruption laws, and could be subject to such investigations in the future, which could result in criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement, further changes or enhancements to our procedures, policies and controls, personnel changes or other remedial actions. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our operations, cause reputational harm, involve significant management attention and result in a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Cybersecurity and data privacy and protection laws and regulations are evolving and present increasing compliance challenges, which may increase our costs, affect our competitiveness, cause reputational harm, and expose us to substantial fines or other penalties. Our Business and Financial Performance May Be Adversely Affected by Climate Change, Including Related Changes in Regulations, Customer Demand, Technologies and Extreme Weather. Our business may be impacted by climate change and governmental and industry actions taken in response. Changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including regulations on greenhouse gas emissions, carbon pricing, and energy taxes, could increase our operational and compliance expenditures and those of our suppliers, including increased energy and raw materials costs, and lead to new or additional investments in product designs and facility upgrades. In addition, we are seeing increasing demands for offerings 23 Table of Contents focused on addressing climate change, transitioning to lower emission technologies, including low to no carbon products and services, the use of alternative energy sources and other sustainable aviation technologies, and climate adaptation products and services. We are also seeing increasing focus on our environmental sustainability commitments with respect to our operations, products and suppliers. As a result, we anticipate that we will need to make additional investments in new technologies and capabilities and devote additional management and other resources in response to the foregoing. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of these investments and actions for a variety of reasons, including technological challenges, evolving government and customer requirements and our ability to anticipate them and develop in-demand technologies on a timely basis, and other risks related to the development of advanced technologies described above. In addition, certain technologies will be dependent upon government action, such as investments in infrastructure, creating appropriate market incentives and making certain raw materials available for development of certain technologies. Moreover we will rely on our suppliers to timely and effectively adapt and meet our evolving technological supply needs. We also face competition risks as our competitors also respond to advancing sustainable technologies. Our competitors may develop these in-demand technologies before we do, their new technologies may be deemed by our customers to be superior to technologies we may develop, and their technologies may otherwise gain industry acceptance in advance of or instead of our products. In addition, as we and our competitors develop increasingly sustainable technologies, demand for our older offerings may decrease or become nonexistent. Moreover, our business, the businesses of our suppliers, subcontractors, service providers, distributors and customers, and the industries in which we operate could be negatively impacted by increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events caused by climate change, including hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, snow and ice storms, fires, heat waves, droughts and mud slides. These events could damage our and our suppliers’ facilities, products and other assets, and cause disruptions to our business and operations, supply chain and distribution networks, and the businesses of our customers. Any of the foregoing could materially decrease our revenues and materially increase our costs and expenses. FINANCIAL, TAX AND INSURANCE RELATED RISKS We Use Estimates in Accounting For Many of Our Programs, and Changes in our Estimates Could Adversely Affect Our Future Financial Results. Accounting for long-term contracts and related assets requires estimates and judgments related to our progress toward completion and the long-term performance on the contract. Significant judgments include potential risks associated with the ability and cost to achieve program schedule, including customer-directed delays or reductions in scheduled deliveries, and technical and other specific contract requirements including customer activity levels and variable consideration based upon that activity. Due to the size and long-term nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Management must make assumptions and estimates regarding contract revenue and cost (such as estimates of variable consideration, including award fees and penalties), including with respect to: (1) labor productivity and availability; (2) the complexity and scope of the work to be performed; (3) the availability and cost of materials; (4) the length of time to complete the performance obligation; (5) execution by our subcontractors; (6) the availability and timing of funding from our customer; (7) overhead cost rates; and (8) current and past service cost and frequency driven by estimated aircraft and engine utilization and estimated useful lives of components, among other variables. Because of the significance of management’s judgments and estimation processes described above, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition. Significant Changes in Key Estimates and Assumptions, Such as Discount Rates and Expected Return on Plan Assets (EROA), as well as Our Actual Investment Returns on Our Pension Plan Assets and Other Actuarial Factors, Could Affect Our Earnings, Equity and Pension Contributions in Future Periods. We must determine our pension and other postretirement benefit (PRB) plans’ expense or income, which involves significant judgment particularly with respect to our discount rate, EROA and other actuarial assumptions. These assumptions are evaluated annually at December 31 and when significant events require a mid-year remeasurement. They may change significantly due to changes in economic, legislative, regulatory, and/or demographic experience or circumstances. Changes in our assumptions or actual experience that differs from these assumptions could impact our pension and postretirement net periodic benefit (income) expense, the plans’ funded status, and/or the required cash contributions to such plans, which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Our plan assets are invested in accordance with our investment management objectives and are subject to market volatility and other conditions. Additional Tax Expense or Additional Tax Exposures Could Affect Our Future Profitability. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and international jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Changes in tax laws and regulations, as well as changes and conflicts in related interpretations and other tax guidance, and fluctuations in taxable income could materially impact our tax receivables and liabilities and our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, as well as our income tax expense and tax payments. Additionally, in the 24 Table of Contents ordinary course of business we are subject to examinations by various tax authorities. In addition to ongoing examinations, there could be additional examinations launched in the future by governmental authorities in various jurisdictions, and existing examinations could be expanded. The final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Additionally, changes in the geographic mix of our sales could impact our tax liabilities and affect our income tax expense and profitability. The global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional examinations, proceedings and contingencies will arise from time to time. Our competitive position, results of operation, financial condition or liquidity may be affected by the outcome of examinations, proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Represent a Significant Portion of Our Assets, and Any Impairment of These Assets Could Negatively Impact Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition. A significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other intangible assets, primarily recorded as the result of historical acquisitions or investments in businesses. We may subsequently experience unforeseen events that could adversely affect the value of our goodwill or intangible assets. Our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to an impairment test annually and are also tested for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. In the event of an impairment, any excess of the carrying value of these assets over the fair value must be written off in the period of determination. Finite-lived intangible assets are generally amortized over the useful life of such assets. Future determinations of significant impairments of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets as a result of an impairment test or accelerated amortization of finite-lived intangible assets could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Quarterly Cash Dividends and Share Repurchases Are Subject to a Number of Uncertainties, and May Affect the Price of Our Common Stock. Quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases under our share repurchase program generally constitute components of our capital allocation strategy, which we fund through a combination of operating free cash flow, borrowings and proceeds from divestitures. However, we are not required to declare dividends or make any share repurchases under our share repurchase program. Dividends and share repurchases may be discontinued, accelerated, suspended or delayed at any time without prior notice. Even if not discontinued, the amount of such dividends and repurchases may be changed, and the amount, timing and frequency of such dividends and repurchases may vary from historical practice or from the company’s stated expectations. Decisions with respect to dividends and share repurchases are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be based on a variety of factors. Important factors that could cause us to discontinue, limit, suspend, increase or delay our quarterly cash dividends or share repurchases include market conditions, the price of our common stock, the nature and timing of other investment opportunities, changes in our business strategy, the terms of our financing arrangements, our outlook as to the ability to obtain financing at attractive rates, the impact on our credit ratings, the availability of domestic cash and overall business expectations. The reduction or elimination of our cash dividend, or suspension or elimination of our share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Additionally, there can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance shareowner value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock, and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program’s effectiveness. We Face Certain Significant Risk Exposures and Potential Liabilities That May Not Be Adequately Covered By Indemnity or Insurance. A significant portion of our business relates to designing, developing and manufacturing advanced aerospace, defense and technology systems and products. New technologies may be untested or unproven. In addition, we may incur significant liabilities that are unique to our products and services. In some, but not all, circumstances, we may be entitled to indemnification from our customers through contractual provisions, and we may obtain limitations of liability and additional defenses for various reasons including the qualification of our products and services by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) under the SAFETY Act provisions of the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The insurance coverage we maintain or indemnification to which we may be contractually or otherwise entitled may not be adequate to cover all claims or liabilities. Accordingly, we may be forced to bear substantial costs resulting from risks and uncertainties of our business, which would negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Any accident, failure of, or defect in our products and services, even if fully indemnified or insured, could negatively affect our reputation among our customers and the public, and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively. It could also affect the cost and availability of insurance in the future. STRATEGIC INITIATIVE AND TRANSACTION RISKS We May Be Unable to Realize Expected Benefits From Strategic Initiatives, and Our Profitability May Be Hurt or Our Business Otherwise Might Be Adversely Affected. In order to operate more effectively and efficiently, from time to time we undertake strategic and other operational initiatives. For example, we have announced plans to improve our business through a significant, multi-year digital transformation initiative. Under this initiative, we would leverage digital capabilities throughout the way in which we conduct our business and provide our products and services to customers, including how we design, build and maintain our products and services. Our ongoing new Customer Oriented Results Excellence (CORE) operating system deployment is another one of these initiatives. Other initiatives include the pursuit of advanced technologies and new business 25 Table of Contents acquisitions and subsequent integrations as described below. We also implement from time to time restructuring plans, which include or may result in workforce reductions, global facility reductions, procurement cost reduction activities, legal entity and operational reorganizations and other cost reduction initiatives. These strategic activities are complex and require the investment of resources including in personnel and systems. If we do not successfully manage our current or future strategic initiatives, expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized, and our operations and business could be disrupted. In addition, certain U.S. government contracts and programs have begun to require digital engineering and other digital capabilities, and our inability to achieve these capabilities with respect to these programs timely may result in loss of revenues. Risks associated with workforce management issues include unfavorable political responses to such actions, unforeseen delays in the implementation of anticipated workforce reductions, additional unexpected costs, adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees or work stoppages. Any of the above factors may impair our ability to achieve anticipated benefits, or otherwise harm our business, or have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. We May Be Unable to Successfully Integrate the Legacy Businesses of United Technologies Corporation (UTC) and Raytheon and Realize the Anticipated Benefits of the Raytheon Merger. The success of the Raytheon Merger will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine and integrate UTC and Raytheon Company’s legacy businesses, and realize the anticipated benefits, including synergies, cost savings, innovation and technological opportunities (including technology-driven revenue synergies) and operational efficiencies from the Raytheon Merger in a manner that does not materially disrupt existing customer, supplier and employee relations and does not result in decreased revenues due to losses of, or decreases in orders by, customers. We may face material challenges to the continued integration of the two companies, including, without limitation: • maintaining employee morale, retaining key management and other employees, and managing corporate culture; • retaining existing business and operational relationships, including customers, suppliers and employees and other counterparties, and attracting new business and operational relationships; • identifying and achieving revenue synergy opportunities among the legacy businesses; and • consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations, including unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems. The impact and extent of these challenges is uncertain and many of them have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Any one of them could result in delays, increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues, reduced expected cash generation, and diversion of management’s time and energy, which could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. In addition, we must continue to manage the integration of other companies, assets and businesses, including the integration of Rockwell Collins, which UTC acquired on November 26, 2018. These ongoing (and future) integrations may increase the complexity of, and challenges associated with, the integration of UTC and Raytheon Company’s legacy businesses, which may make it more difficult for us to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Raytheon Merger fully, or within the anticipated time frame. The actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized on a timely basis. While we have assumed that a certain level of expenses would be incurred, many of the expenses that may be incurred are, by their nature, difficult to estimate accurately, and changes to the estimates could affect the total amount or timing of integration expenses. These expenses could exceed benefits expected to be realized in connection with the Raytheon Merger. If We Fail to Manage Potential Future Acquisitions, Investments, Divestitures, Joint Ventures and Other Transactions Successfully, These Activities Could Adversely Affect Our Future Financial Results. In pursuing our business strategies, we continually review, evaluate and consider potential investments, acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures and other teaming and collaborative arrangements. We undertake to identify opportunities that will complement our existing products and services or customer base, as well as expand our offerings and business opportunities into new areas that naturally extend from our core capabilities. In evaluating such transactions, we are required to make difficult judgments regarding the value of business opportunities, technologies and other assets, and the risks and cost of potential liabilities. Further, these transactions involve certain other risks and uncertainties including: (1) the risks involved with entering new markets; (2) the difficulty in integrating newly-acquired businesses and managing or monitoring other collaborative business arrangements; (3) challenges and failures in achieving strategic objectives and other expected benefits, which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments; (4) unidentified issues not discovered in RTC’s due diligence; (5) the diversion of our attention and resources from our operations and other initiatives; (6) the potential impairment of acquired assets; (7) the performance of underlying products, capabilities or technologies; and (8) the potential loss of key employees and customers of acquired businesses. In addition, future transactions may impact our deployment of capital, including dividends, stock repurchases, pension contributions, and investments. We May Not Be Able to Engage in Desirable Capital-Raising or Strategic Transactions. Under current U.S. federal income tax law, a spin-off that otherwise qualifies for tax-free treatment can be rendered taxable to the parent corporation and its 26 Table of Contents stockholders as a result of certain post-spin-off transactions, including certain acquisitions of shares or assets of the parent corporation. To preserve the tax-free treatment of the Distributions, we may be limited in our ability to pursue certain equity issuances, strategic transactions, repurchases, or other transactions (including certain dispositions of assets) that we may otherwise believe to be in the best interests of our stockholders or that might increase the value of our business. If Either Distribution, Together with Certain Related Transactions, Were to Fail to Qualify as a Transaction that is Generally Tax-Free, Including as a Result of Subsequent Acquisitions of Our Stock (Including Pursuant to the Raytheon Merger) or the Stock of Carrier or Otis, We Could Be Subject to Significant Tax Liabilities. We received (1) a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regarding certain U.S. federal income tax matters relating to the Separation Transactions and Distributions and (2) an opinion of outside counsel regarding the qualification of certain elements of the Distributions under Section 355 of the Code. Although we intend for the Distributions generally to be tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, there can be no assurance that they will so qualify. Even if the Distributions were to otherwise qualify as tax-free transactions under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, either Distribution or both Distributions may result in taxable gain to us (but not our stockholders) under Section 355(e) of the Code if such Distribution(s) were deemed to be part of a plan (or series of related transactions) pursuant to which one or more persons acquire, directly or indirectly, shares representing a 50% or greater interest (by vote or value) in shares of Carrier, Otis, or us, as applicable. If the IRS were to determine that any post-Distribution acquisitions of Carrier stock, Otis stock, or our stock, as applicable, pursuant to such a plan (when aggregated with any pre-Distribution acquisitions of Carrier stock, Otis stock, or our stock, as applicable, pursuant to such a plan) would represent a 50% or greater interest in shares of Carrier, Otis, or us, as applicable, such determination could result in significant tax liabilities to us. For purposes of this test, even if the Raytheon Merger were treated as part of such plan, it did not result in an acquisition of a 50% or greater interest in our shares pursuant to a plan. Any such tax liabilities imposed on us may adversely affect an investment in us. In addition, with respect to certain Separation Transactions, we obtained tax rulings in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions and/or opinions of external tax advisors, in each case, regarding the tax treatment of such Separation Transactions. Notwithstanding the receipt of such tax rulings and opinions, there can be no assurance that the relevant taxing authorities will not assert that the tax treatment of the relevant Separation Transactions differs from the conclusions reached therein. In the event the relevant taxing authorities prevail with any challenge in respect of any relevant Separation Transaction, we would be subject to significant tax liabilities, which may adversely affect an investment in us. Further, under a tax matters agreement that we entered into with Carrier and Otis in connection with the Separation Transactions and Distributions, each of Carrier and Otis generally is required to indemnify us for any taxes we incur resulting from the Separation Transactions and/or the Distributions to the extent such amounts result from certain disqualifying actions by, or acquisition of equity securities of, Carrier or Otis, as applicable. Further, under the tax matters agreement, each of Carrier and Otis is generally required to indemnify us for a specified portion of any taxes we incur (a) arising as a result of the failure of either of the Distributions and certain related transactions to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free or a failure of any Separation Transaction that is intended to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free to so qualify, in each case, to the extent such amounts did not result from a disqualifying action by, or acquisition of equity securities of, Carrier, Otis, or us or (b) arising from certain audit or other adjustments to tax liabilities incurred with respect to Separation Transactions that were not intended to qualify as tax-free. In addition, under the tax matters agreement, each of Carrier and Otis is responsible for (i) a specified portion of any installment payment we are required to make pursuant to Section 965(h)(2) of the Code and (ii) specified taxes that exclusively relate to the Carrier business or the Otis business, as applicable. The amount of any such taxes for which we would be responsible may be significant, and if we were unable to obtain indemnification payments from Carrier or Otis to which we are entitled under the tax matters agreement and/or other agreements entered into in connection with the Separation Transactions and the Distributions, we would incur significant losses. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES We have significant properties in approximately 30 countries, with approximately 540 significant properties comprising approximately 75 million square feet of productive space. Approximately 30% of our square footage related to our significant properties is leased, and 70% is owned. Approximately 60% of our square footage related to our significant properties is located in the United States. Our fixed assets as of December 31, 2021 include manufacturing facilities and non-manufacturing facilities such as warehouses, laboratories, office space, and a substantial quantity of machinery and equipment, including general purpose machinery and equipment using special jigs, tools and fixtures and in many instances having automatic control features and special adaptations. The facilities, warehouses, machinery and equipment in use as of December 31, 2021 are in good operating condition, are well-maintained and substantially all are generally in regular use. 27 Table of Contents ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and claims (some of which involve substantial amounts). For a discussion of contingencies related to certain legal proceedings, see “Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Except as otherwise noted, while we are unable to predict the final outcome, based on information currently available, we do not believe that resolution of any of these matters will have a material adverse effect upon our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. A further discussion of government contracts and related investigations, as well as a discussion of our environmental liabilities, can be found under the heading “Other Matters Relating to Our Business – Environmental Regulation” within Item 1. Business of this Form 10-K and in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10-K. 737 MAX Aircraft Litigation Multiple lawsuits have been filed in U.S. courts relating to the October 29, 2018 Lion Air Flight 610 and the March 10, 2019 Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 accidents. Collins Aerospace Systems (Collins Aerospace) sold certain aircraft parts and systems to The Boeing Company for the 737 MAX aircraft involved in these accidents. Certain of our Collins Aerospace businesses have been named, along with other third parties, as parties in many of these lawsuits. We are also fully supporting all ongoing governmental investigations and inquiries relating to the accidents. We do not expect that the lawsuits or governmental investigations or inquiries will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. ITEM 4.

We may also reacquire shares outside of the program from time to time in connection with the surrender of shares to cover taxes on vesting of restricted stock and as required under our employee savings plan. Our ability to repurchase shares is subject to applicable law. No shares were reacquired in transactions outside the program during the quarter ended December 31, 2021. ITEM 6. Reserved. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BUSINESS OVERVIEW We are a global premier systems provider of high technology products and services to the aerospace and defense industries. We operate in four principal business segments: Collins Aerospace Systems (Collins Aerospace), Pratt & Whitney, Raytheon Intelligence & Space (RIS) and Raytheon Missiles & Defense (RMD). On April 3, 2020, United Technologies Corporation (UTC) (since renamed Raytheon Technologies Corporation) completed the separation of its business into three independent, publicly traded companies – UTC, Carrier Global Corporation (Carrier) and Otis Worldwide Corporation (Otis) (the Separation Transactions). UTC distributed all of the outstanding shares of Carrier common stock and all of the outstanding shares of Otis common stock to UTC shareowners who held shares of UTC common stock as of the close of business on March 19, 2020 (the Distributions). Immediately following the Separation Transactions and Distributions, on April 3, 2020, UTC and Raytheon Company completed their all-stock merger of equals transaction (the Raytheon Merger), pursuant to which Raytheon Company became a wholly-owned subsidiary of UTC and UTC was renamed Raytheon Technologies Corporation (RTC). UTC was determined to be the accounting acquirer in the Raytheon Merger, and as a result the financial statements of Raytheon Technologies for year ended December 31, 2020 include Raytheon Company’s financial position and results of operations for the period subsequent to the completion of the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020. The historical results of Carrier and Otis are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. See “Note 3: Discontinued Operations” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “we,” “our,” “us,” “the Company,” “Raytheon Technologies,” and “RTC” mean United Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries when referring to periods prior to the Raytheon Merger and to the combined company, Raytheon Technologies Corporation, when referring to periods after the Raytheon Merger. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “Raytheon Company,” or “Raytheon” mean Raytheon Company and its subsidiaries prior to the Raytheon Merger. Industry Considerations Our worldwide operations can be affected by industrial, economic and political factors on both a regional and global level. Our operations include original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and extensive related aftermarket parts and services related to our aerospace operations. Our defense business serves both domestic and international customers primarily as a prime contractor or subcontractor on a broad portfolio of defense and related programs for government customers. Our business mix also reflects the combination of shorter cycles in our commercial aerospace spares contracts and certain service contracts in our defense business primarily at RIS, and longer cycles in our aerospace OEM and aftermarket maintenance contracts and on our defense contracts to design, develop, manufacture or modify complex equipment. Our customers are in the public and private sectors, and our businesses reflect an extensive geographic diversification that has evolved with continued globalization. Government legislation, policies and regulations, including regulations related to global warming, carbon footprint and fuel efficiency, can have a negative impact on our worldwide operations. Government and industry-driven safety and performance regulations, restrictions on aircraft engine noise and emissions, government imposed travel restrictions, and government procurement practices can impact our businesses. Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney serve both commercial and government aerospace customers. Revenue passenger miles (RPMs), available seat miles and the general economic health of airline carriers are key barometers for our commercial aerospace operations. Performance in the general aviation sector is closely tied to the overall health of the economy and is positively correlated to corporate profits. Many of our aerospace operations’ customers are covered under long-term aftermarket service agreements at both Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney, which are inclusive of both spare parts and services. RIS, RMD, and the defense operations of Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney are affected by U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) budget and spending levels, changes in demand, changes in policy positions or priorities and the global political environment. Business Transformation and Operational Excellence We are leveraging the Raytheon Merger to undertake various strategic initiatives to transform the Company and increase our existing focus on operational excellence. These initiatives include our new Customer Oriented Results Excellence (CORE) operating system, significant investments in digital technologies across our business to enhance our products and services, and structural cost reduction initiatives. We are also continuing to develop advanced technologies, including through specific technology-focused business acquisitions. 31 Table of Contents Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic The COVID-19 pandemic continues to negatively affect the global economy, our business and operations, supply chains, and the industries in which we operate. For a discussion of the risk factors associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors within Part I of this Form 10-K. As a result of all of these factors, we expect our future operating results, particularly those of our Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney businesses, to continue to be negatively impacted when compared to pre-COVID-19 (2019) results. Our RIS and RMD businesses, although experiencing some negative impacts, primarily from supply chain pressures and labor shortages, have not experienced significant business disruptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. While we believe that the long-term outlook for the aerospace industry remains positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel demand, there continues to be uncertainty with respect to the point at which commercial air traffic capacity will return to and/or exceed pre-COVID-19 levels. We have seen indications that commercial air travel is recovering in certain areas of demand; however, other areas continue to lag. In addition, while global vaccination rates have increased, infection from COVID-19 variants have continued, which may impact the pace of the commercial aerospace recovery. Further, the commercial air travel recovery is tied to general economic conditions and may be impacted by inflation or government budget deficits, among other factors. However, we continue to estimate that a full recovery may occur in 2023 or 2024. As our commercial aerospace business recovers, we have seen increases in certain employee-related and discretionary costs, which had decreased in the aftermath of COVID-19 due to one-time cost reduction actions in 2020. A recovery may also impact our judgments around credit risk related to estimated credit losses. In addition, in March 2021, Congress passed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA) which included pension funding relief provisions. For further discussion, refer to the “FAS/CAS operating adjustment” subsection under the “Segment Review” section below. We continue to monitor for any further government guidance related to COVID-19 that may be issued. On September 24, 2021, in furtherance of an executive order, the U.S. Safer Federal Workforce Task Force issued guidance requiring federal contractors and subcontractors to comply with COVID-19 safety protocols, including requiring certain employees to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 except in limited circumstances. The implementation of this mandate may result in attrition, including attrition of critically skilled labor and difficulty in securing future labor needs, for our workforce, as well as the workforces of our subcontractors, suppliers and customers. The mandate is currently subject to various legal proceedings. As a result, the impact of mandate on our operations and performance, as well as on our subcontractors, suppliers and customers, is uncertain. However, if ultimately required, the mandate could affect our performance on contracts, particularly due to disruptions in subcontractor or supplier performance or deliveries, and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our expectations regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing recovery and their potential financial impact are based on available information and assumptions that we believe are reasonable at this time; however, the actual financial impact is highly uncertain and subject to a wide range of factors and future developments. New information may continue to emerge concerning the scope, severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as any worsening of the pandemic, the effect of additional variants, the efficacy, acceptance, distribution and availability of vaccines, new or continued actions to contain the pandemic’s spread or treat its impact, and governmental, business and individual actions taken in response to the pandemic (including restrictions and limitations on travel and transportation, and changes in leisure and business travel patterns and work environments) among others. Some of these actions and related impacts may be trends that continue in the future even after the pandemic no longer poses a significant public health risk. Other Matters Global economic and political conditions, changes in raw material and commodity prices, labor costs, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, energy costs, levels of air travel, the financial condition of commercial airlines, and the impact from natural disasters and weather conditions create uncertainties that could impact our businesses. With regard to political conditions, in July 2019, the U.S. government suspended Turkey’s participation in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program because Turkey accepted delivery of the Russian-built S-400 air and missile defense system. The U.S. has imposed, and may impose additional, sanctions on Turkey, as well as contractual restrictions on the use of Turkish sources on certain military programs, as a result of this or other political disputes. Turkish companies supply us with components, some of which are sole-sourced, primarily in our aerospace operations for commercial and military engines and aerospace products. Depending upon the scope and timing of U.S. sanctions or contractual prohibitions on Turkey and potential reciprocal actions, if any, such sanctions or actions could impact our sources of supply and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. In addition, in October 2020, the People’s Republic of China (China) announced that it may sanction RTC in connection with a possible Foreign Military Sale to Taiwan of six MS-110 Reconnaissance Pods and related equipment manufactured by Collins Aerospace. Foreign Military Sales are government-to-government transactions that are initiated by, and carried out at the direction of, the U.S. government. To date, the Chinese government has not imposed 32 Table of Contents sanctions on RTC or indicated the nature or timing of any future potential sanctions or other actions. If China were to impose sanctions or take other regulatory action against RTC, our suppliers, affiliates or partners, it could potentially disrupt our business operations. The impact of potential sanctions or other actions by China cannot be determined at this time. We have direct commercial sales contracts for products and services to certain foreign customers, for which U.S. government review and approval have been pending. The U.S. government’s approval of these sales is subject to a range of factors, including its foreign policies related to these customers, which are subject to continuing review and potential changes. Likewise, regulatory approvals previously granted for prior sales can be paused or revoked if the products and services have not yet been delivered to the customer. If we ultimately do not receive all of the regulatory approvals, or those approvals are revoked, it could have a material effect on our financial results. In particular, as of December 31, 2021, our Contract liabilities include approximately $430 million of advance payments received from a Middle East customer on contracts for which we no longer believe we will be able to execute or obtain required regulatory approvals. These advance payments may become refundable to the customer if the contracts are ultimately terminated. See Item 1A. Risk Factors within Part I of this Form 10-K for further discussion of these items. FINANCIAL SUMMARY We use the following key financial performance measures to manage our business on a consolidated basis and by business segment, and to monitor and assess our results of operations: – Net Sales — a growth metric that measures our revenue for the current year; – Operating Profit (Loss) — a measure of our profit (loss) for the year, before non-operating expenses, net and income taxes; and – Operating Profit (Loss) Margin — a measure of our Operating profit (loss) as a percentage of Total Net Sales. (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Total Net Sales $ 64,388 $ 56,587 $ 45,349 Operating profit (loss) 4,958 (1,889) 4,914 Operating profit (loss) margins 7.7 % (3.3) % 10.8 % Operating cash flow from continuing operations $ 7,142 $ 4,334 $ 5,821 In order to better assess the underlying performance of our business, we also focus on the change in organic net sales on both a consolidated basis and business segment basis, and the change in organic operating profit (loss) on a business segment basis, which allows for better year-over-year comparability. See Results of Operations below for our definition of the organic change in Net sales and Operating profit (loss), which are not defined measures under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and may be calculated differently by other companies. We also focus on backlog as a key financial performance measure of our forward-looking sales growth. Total backlog was $ 156 billion and $150 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Backlog, which is equivalent to our remaining performance obligations (RPO) for our sales contracts, represents the aggregate dollar value of firm orders for which products have not been provided or service has not been performed and excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering-type contracts (e.g., indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) type contracts). Segment backlog does not include intercompany backlog. Backlog generally increases with bookings and/or orders and generally decreases as sales are recognized on these bookings and is affected by changes in foreign exchange rates, as well as contract cancellations and terminations, and cost underruns on cost-type contracts. In addition, we maintain a strong focus on program execution and the prudent management of capital and investments in order to maximize operating income and cash. We focus on adjusted earnings per share (EPS) and measures to assess our cash generation and the efficiency and effectiveness of our use of capital, such as free cash flow (FCF), both of which are not defined measures under U.S. GAAP and may be calculated differently by other companies. Considered together, we believe these metrics are strong indicators of our overall performance and our ability to create shareowner value. We feel these measures are balanced among long-term and short-term performance, efficiency and growth. We also use these and other performance metrics for executive compensation purposes. A discussion of our results of operations and financial condition follows below in Results of Operations, Segment Review, and Liquidity and Financial Condition. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS As described in our “Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results” in this Form 10-K, our period-to-period comparisons of our results, particularly at a segment level, may not be indicative of our future operating results. The 33 Table of Contents following discussions of comparative results among periods, including the discussion of segment results, should be viewed in this context. As discussed further above in “Business Overview,” the results of RIS and RMD reflect the period subsequent to the completion of the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020. As such, the results of RIS and RMD for the second quarter of 2020 exclude results prior to the date of completion of the Raytheon Merger, the estimated impact of which is approximately $400 million of sales and approximately $45 million of operating profit. These amounts, in addition to the first quarter of 2021 results, have been excluded from the organic changes for the year ended December 31, 2021 disclosed throughout our Results of Operations discussion. In addition, as a result of the Separation Transactions and the Distributions, the historical results of Carrier and Otis are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. We provide the organic change in Net sales and Cost of sales for our consolidated results of operations as well as the organic change in Net sales and Operating profit (loss) for our segments. We believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they provide transparency to the underlying performance of our business, which allows for better year-over-year comparability. The organic change in Net sales, Cost of sales and Operating Profit (loss) excludes acquisitions and divestitures, net, and the effect of foreign currency exchange rate translation fluctuations and other significant non-recurring and non-operational items (“Other.”). Additionally, the organic change in Cost of sales and Operating profit (loss) excludes restructuring costs, the FAS/CAS operating adjustment and costs related to certain acquisition accounting adjustments. Acquisition accounting adjustments include the amortization of acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions, the amortization of the property, plant and equipment fair value adjustment acquired through acquisitions and the amortization of customer contractual obligations related to loss making or below market contracts acquired. Net Sales (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Total Net Sales $ 64,388 $ 56,587 $ 45,349 The factors contributing to the total change year-over-year in Total Net Sales are as follows: (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 Organic (1) $ 724 $ (10,438) Acquisitions and divestitures, net 6,961 21,662 Other 116 14 Total change $ 7,801 $ 11,238 (1) See “Results of Operations” for definition of organic. A reconciliation of this measure to reported U.S. GAAP amounts is provided in the table above. Net sales increased $0.7 billion organically in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to higher organic sales of $1.3 billion at Pratt & Whitney, partially offset by lower organic sales of $0.6 billion at Collins Aerospace. The $7.0 billion sales increase in Acquisitions and divestitures, net in 2021 compared to 2020, was primarily driven by the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020, partially offset by the sale of the Collins Aerospace military Global Positioning System (GPS) and space-based precision optics businesses in the third quarter of 2020 and the sale of our Forcepoint business in the first quarter of 2021. Net sales decreased $10.4 billion organically in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to lower sales of $6.6 billion at Collins Aerospace and $4.1 billion at Pratt & Whitney all principally driven by the economic and operating environment primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The $21.7 billion sales increase in Acquisitions and divestitures, net in 2020 compared to 2019, is primarily driven by the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020. Included in the change in Acquisitions and divestitures, net was the sale of the Collins Aerospace military GPS and space-based precision optics businesses sold in the third quarter of 2020, as further discussed in “Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. See “Segment Review” below for further information by segment. 34 Table of Contents % of Total Net Sales (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 2019 Net sales Products sales $ 49,270 $ 43,319 $ 32,998 77 % 77 % 73 % Services sales 15,118 13,268 12,351 23 % 23 % 27 % Total Net Sales $ 64,388 $ 56,587 $ 45,349 100 % 100 % 100 % Refer to “Note 22: Segment Financial Data” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for the composition of external net sales by products and services by segment. Net products sales grew $6.0 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in external products sales of $3.7 billion at RMD and $3.0 billion at RIS, both primarily due to the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020, and an increase in external products sales of $1.0 billion at Pratt & Whitney, partially offset by a decrease in external products sales of $1.3 billion at Collins Aerospace. Net services sales grew $1.9 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in external services sales of $0.8 billion at RIS and $0.4 billion at RMD, both primarily due to the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020, and an increase in external services sales of $0.4 billion at Pratt & Whitney and $0.3 billion at Collins Aerospace. Net products sales grew $10.3 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to an increase in external products sales of $18.4 billion due to the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020, partially offset by decreases in external products sales of $5.3 billion at Collins Aerospace and $2.8 billion at Pratt & Whitney. Net services sales grew $0.9 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to an increase in external services sales of $3.4 billion due to the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020, partially offset by decreases in external services sales of $1.3 billion at Pratt & Whitney and $1.2 billion at Collins Aerospace. Our sales to major customers were as follows: % of Total Net Sales (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 2019 Sales to the U.S. government (1) $ 31,177 $ 25,962 $ 9,094 48 % 46 % 20 % Foreign military sales through the U.S. government 5,546 4,585 1,571 9 % 8 % 3 % Foreign government direct commercial sales 4,993 3,974 1,498 8 % 7 % 3 % Commercial aerospace and other commercial sales 22,672 22,066 33,186 35 % 39 % 73 % Total Net Sales $ 64,388 $ 56,587 $ 45,349 100 % 100 % 100 % (1) Excludes foreign military sales through the U.S. government. Cost of Sales (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Total Cost of sales $ 51,897 $ 48,056 $ 34,598 Percentage of net sales 81 % 85 % 76 % The factors contributing to the change year-over-year in total Cost of sales are as follows: (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 Organic (1) $ (1,293) $ (4,432) Acquisitions and divestitures, net 5,829 17,696 Restructuring (363) 220 FAS/CAS operating adjustment (643) (965) Acquisition accounting adjustments 345 939 Other (34) — Total change $ 3,841 $ 13,458 (1) See “Results of Operations” for definition of organic. A reconciliation of this measure to reported U.S. GAAP amounts is provided in the table above. The organic decrease in total Cost of sales in 2021 compared to 2020 of $1.3 billion was primarily due to a decrease in organic Cost of sales at Collins Aerospace primarily due to the sales decrease noted above, the benefit of cost reduction initiatives, and the absence of prior year significant unfavorable adjustments, and a decrease in organic Cost of sales at RMD primarily due to the absence of an unfavorable profit impact of $516 million related to inventory reserves, contract asset impairments and 35 Table of Contents recognition of supplier related obligations for certain international contracts as further described in “Segment Review” below. These decreases in Cost of sales were partially offset by an increase in organic Cost of sales at Pratt & Whitney due to the organic sales increases noted above. The increase in Acquisitions and divestitures, net of $5.8 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 is primarily driven by the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020, partially offset by the sale of the Collins Aerospace military GPS and space-based precision optics businesses in the third quarter of 2020 and the sale of our Forcepoint business in the first quarter of 2021 as further discussed in “Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The organic decrease in total Cost of sales in 2020 compared to 2019, of $4.4 billion was primarily driven by the organic sales decreases noted above. The increase in Acquisitions and divestitures, net of $17.7 billion for 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily driven by the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020. Included in the change in Acquisitions and divestitures, net is the sale of the Collins Aerospace military GPS and space-based precision optics businesses sold in the third quarter of 2020, and an unfavorable profit impact of $516 million related to inventory reserves, contract asset impairments and recognition of supplier related obligations for certain international contracts at RMD as further described in “Segment Review” below. Included in Other cost of sales was an $89 million impairment of commercial aircraft program assets at Pratt & Whitney in 2020 and amortization of the inventory fair value step-up associated with the Rockwell Collins acquisition of $181 million at Collins Aerospace in 2019.

For further discussion on Acquisition accounting adjustments, see “Acquisition accounting adjustments” subsection under the “Segment Review” section below. % of Total Net Sales (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 2019 Cost of sales Products $ 41,095 $ 38,137 $ 26,910 64 % 67 % 59 % Services 10,802 9,919 7,688 17 % 18 % 17 % Total Cost of Sales $ 51,897 $ 48,056 $ 34,598 81 % 85 % 76 % Net products Cost of sales increased $3.0 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in external products cost of sales at RIS and RMD principally due to the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020, and an increase in external product cost of sales at Pratt & Whitney, principally driven by the products sales increase noted above, partially offset by a decrease in external products Cost of sales at Collins Aerospace, principally driven by the products sales decrease noted above, the benefit of cost reduction initiatives and the absence of prior year significant unfavorable adjustments. Net services Cost of sales grew $0.9 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in external services Cost of sales at RIS and RMD principally due to the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020. Net products Cost of sales grew $11.2 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to an increase in external products Cost of sales due to the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020, partially offset by decreases in external products Cost of sales at Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney. Net services Cost of sales grew $2.2 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to an increase in external services Cost of sales due to the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020, partially offset by a decrease in external services Cost of sales at Collins Aerospace. Research and Development (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Company-funded $ 2,732 $ 2,582 $ 2,452 Percentage of net sales 4.2 % 4.6 % 5.4 % Customer-funded (1) $ 4,485 $ 4,111 $ 2,283 Percentage of net sales 7.0 % 7.3 % 5.0 % (1) Customer-funded research and development costs are included in cost of sales in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Research and development spending is subject to the variable nature of program development schedules and, therefore, year-over-year fluctuations in spending levels are expected. The increase in company-funded research and development of $0.2 billion in 2021 compared to 2020, was primarily driven by $0.2 billion related to the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020. The increase in company-funded research and development of $0.1 billion in 2020 compared to 2019, was primarily driven by $0.6 billion related to the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020, partially offset by lower expenses of $0.3 billion across various 36 Table of Contents commercial programs at Pratt & Whitney and $0.2 billion across various commercial programs at Collins Aerospace, both principally driven by cost reduction measures in response to the economic environment primarily due to COVID-19. The increase in customer-funded research and development of $0.4 billion in 2021 compared to 2020, was primarily driven by $0.6 billion related to the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020, partially offset by lower expenses of $0.2 billion on various military and commercial programs at Pratt & Whitney and lower expenses of $0.1 billion at Collins Aerospace primarily related to the sale of the military GPS and space-based precision optics businesses in the third quarter of 2020. The increase in customer-funded research and development of $1.8 billion in 2020 compared to 2019, was primarily driven by $1.7 billion related to the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020. Selling, General and Administrative (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Selling, general and administrative $ 5,224 $ 5,540 $ 3,711 Percentage of net sales 8.1 % 9.8 % 8.2 % Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $0.3 billion in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily driven by the absence of $0.4 billion of prior year charges related to increased estimates of expected credit losses due to customer bankruptcies and additional allowances for credit losses at our Pratt & Whitney and Collins Aerospace segments, lower costs of $0.3 billion due to the sale of our Forcepoint business in the first quarter of 2021, and lower general and administrative restructuring costs of $0.3 billion primarily related to restructuring actions taken at Collins Aerospace and Corporate in the prior year, partially offset by an increase in expenses of $0.4 billion related to the Raytheon Merger, and higher employee-related costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $1.8 billion in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily driven by $1.6 billion related to the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020, excluding the impact of merger-related restructuring costs. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses also includes higher expenses of $0.4 billion related to increased estimates of expected credit losses primarily due to customer bankruptcies and additional allowances for credit losses at Pratt & Whitney and Collins Aerospace, higher general and administrative restructuring costs of $0.3 billion, and lower expenses due to cost reduction initiatives. We are continuously evaluating our cost structure and have implemented restructuring actions in an effort to keep our cost structure competitive. As appropriate, the amounts reflected above include the beneficial impact of previous restructuring actions on selling, general and administrative expenses. See “Note 14: Restructuring Costs” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K and Restructuring Costs, below, for further discussion. Other Income, Net (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Other income, net $ 423 $ 885 $ 326 Other income, net includes equity earnings in unconsolidated entities, royalty income, foreign exchange gains and losses, as well as other ongoing and nonrecurring items. The decrease in Other income, net of $462 million in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to the absence of $595 million of gains on the sales of the Collins Aerospace businesses in the third quarter of 2020, a decrease of $178 million of foreign government wage subsidies related to COVID-19 at Pratt & Whitney and Collins Aerospace and an accrual of $147 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 related to the ongoing Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation into contract pricing matters at RMD, partially offset by a gain of $269 million on the sale of RIS’s global training and services business in the fourth quarter of 2021, as further discussed in “Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The remaining change was spread across multiple items with no common or significant driver. The increase in Other income, net of $559 million in 2020 compared to 2019, was primarily due to $595 million of gains on the sales of the Collins Aerospace businesses, and $225 million related to foreign government wage subsidies due to COVID-19 at Pratt & Whitney and Collins Aerospace, partially offset by a net unfavorable year-over-year impact of foreign exchange gains and losses of $138 million. 37 Table of Contents Operating Profit (Loss) (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Operating profit (loss) $ 4,958 $ (1,889) $ 4,914 Operating profit (loss) margin 7.7 % (3.3) % 10.8 % The change in Operating profit (loss) of $6.8 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily driven by the operating performance at our operating segments, including the impact of the Raytheon Merger, the absence of the $3.2 billion goodwill impairment in the second quarter of 2020 related to two Collins Aerospace reporting units, and an increase in our FAS/CAS operating adjustment of $690 million primarily as a result of the Raytheon Merger. Included in the increase in Operating profit was a decrease in restructuring costs of $625 million primarily related to restructuring actions taken at our Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney segments in the prior year and the absence of a prior year unfavorable profit impact of $516 million related to inventory reserves, contract asset impairments and recognition of supplier related obligations for certain international contracts at RMD as further described in “Segment Review” below. The change in Operating profit (loss) of $6.8 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily driven by the operating performance at our segments as described below in “Segment Review” and the $3.2 billion goodwill impairment in the second quarter of 2020 related to two Collins Aerospace reporting units. Included in the decrease in Operating profit (loss) was an increase in acquisition accounting adjustments of $1.1 billion related to the Raytheon Merger, an increase in restructuring costs of $527 million primarily related to restructuring actions taken at our Collins Aerospace segment and restructuring actions in connection with the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020 and an unfavorable profit impact of $516 million related to inventory reserves, contract asset impairments and recognition of supplier related obligations for certain international contracts at RMD as further described in “Segment Review” below. Non-service Pension Income (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Non-service pension (income) $ (1,944) $ (902) $ (829) The change in Non-service pension income of $1.0 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily driven by the decrease in the discount rates at December 31, 2020 compared to the prior period, the Raytheon Company domestic defined benefit pension plan amendment described below and prior year pension asset returns exceeding our expected return on plan assets (EROA) assumption. The change in Non-service pension income of $73 million in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily driven by the inclusion of Raytheon Company plans in 2020 as a result of the Raytheon Merger and a decrease in the interest rates at December 31, 2019 and during 2020 compared to December 31, 2018, partially offset by a decrease in the EROA assumption for the UTC plans in 2020 and a one-time curtailment gain of $98 million in 2019. The one-time curtailment gain was due to the recognition of previously unrecognized prior service credits as a result of an amendment to the UTC domestic defined benefit plans to cease accrual of additional benefits for future service and compensation for non-union participants effective December 31, 2019. In December 2020, we approved a change to the Raytheon Company domestic defined benefit pension plans for non-union participants to cease future benefit accruals based on an employee’s years of service and compensation effective December 31, 2022. The plan change does not impact participants’ historical benefit accruals. Benefits for service after December 31, 2022 will be based on a cash balance formula. Interest Expense, Net (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Interest expense $ 1,358 $ 1,408 $ 1,711 Interest income (36) (42) (120) Interest expense, net $ 1,322 $ 1,366 $ 1,591 Total average interest expense rate - average outstanding borrowings during the year: 4.1 % 4.0 % 3.6 % Total average interest expense rate - outstanding borrowings as of December 31: 4.0 % 4.2 % 3.6 % Interest expense, net in 2021 was relatively consistent with 2020. Included in Interest expense, net was a $50 million unfavorable change in the mark-to-market fair value of marketable securities held in trusts associated with certain of our nonqualified deferred compensation and employee benefit plans, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense primarily due to the repayment of long-term debt. The average maturity of our long-term debt at December 31, 2021 was approximately 15 years. 38 Table of Contents Interest expense, net decreased $225 million in 2020 as compared with 2019, primarily due to a decrease in interest expense principally driven by the repayment of long-term debt, partially offset by a decrease in interest income principally driven by interest income of $63 million related to tax settlements in the prior year. The average maturity of our long-term debt at December 31, 2020 was approximately 14 years. Income Taxes 2021 2020 2019 Effective income tax rate 15.9 % (24.4) % 10.1 % The 2021 effective tax rate includes tax benefits of $244 million associated with legal entity and operational reorganizations implemented in the third quarter of 2021, $172 million associated with U.S. research and development credits and $121 million associated with Foreign Derived Intangible Income (FDII), and tax charges of $73 million associated with the revaluation of deferred taxes resulting from the increase in the United Kingdom (U.K.) corporate tax rate to 25% enacted in 2021 and effective in 2023. In the first quarter of 2021, we recorded $148 million of tax charges associated with the sale of the Forcepoint business, and subsequently recognized a $104 million tax benefit due to the revaluation of that tax benefit as a result of completing the divestiture of RIS’s global training and services business for a gain in the fourth quarter of 2021. The 2020 negative effective tax rate is a result of having tax expense of $575 million on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $2.4 billion. The loss from continuing operations before income taxes in 2020 includes the $3.2 billion goodwill impairment, most of which was non-deductible for tax purposes. Tax expense includes net deferred tax charges of $416 million resulting from the Separation Transactions and the Raytheon Merger primarily related to the impairment of deferred tax assets and the revaluation of certain international tax incentives, and incremental tax expense of $177 million related to the disposal of businesses, including the sales of businesses at Collins Aerospace, the airborne tactical radios business at RIS and the entry into a definitive agreement to sell Forcepoint. Also included in the 2020 effective tax rate are tax benefits of $142 million associated with U.S. research and development credits and $83 million associated with FDII. The 2019 effective tax rate includes tax benefits of $290 million primarily associated with the conclusion of the audit by the Examination Division of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the Company’s 2014, 2015 and 2016 tax years and the filing by a subsidiary of the Company to participate in an amnesty program offered by the Italian Tax Authority. The 2019 effective tax rate also includes tax benefits of $101 million related to U.S. research and development credits and $138 million associated with FDII. Provisions enacted in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) related to the capitalization for tax purposes of research and experimental expenditures became effective on January 1, 2022. If these provisions are not deferred beyond 2022, our tax payments will increase by an estimated $2 billion in 2022; however, our effective tax rate will be favorably impacted. For additional discussion of income taxes and the effective income tax rate, see “Income Taxes” within Critical Accounting Estimates, below, and “Note 13: Income Taxes” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Net Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations Attributable to Common Shareowners (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2021 2020 2019 Net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners $ 3,897 $ (3,109) $ 3,510 Diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations $ 2.58 $ (2.29) $ 4.06 Net income from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners for 2021 includes the following: • acquisition accounting adjustments primarily related to the Raytheon Merger of $1.7 billion, net of tax, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $1.13; • net debt extinguishment costs of $524 million, net of tax, in connection with the early repayment of outstanding principal, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.35; • tax benefits of $244 million associated with legal entity and operational reorganizations implemented in the third quarter 2021, which had a favorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.16; • tax expense of $148 million related to the sale of our Forcepoint business in the first quarter of 2021, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.10, and the subsequent revaluation of that tax benefit of $104 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, due to the completion of the divestiture of RIS’s global training and services business for a gain, which had an favorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.07; • accrual of $147 million related to the ongoing DOJ investigation into contract pricing matters at RMD, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.10; 39 Table of Contents • restructuring charges of $121 million, net of tax, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.08; and • gain on the sale of our global training and services business within our RIS segment of $126 million, net of tax, which had a favorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.08.

Net income from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners for 2019 includes the following: • acquisition accounting adjustments of $704 million, net of tax, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.81; • restructuring charges of $186 million, net of tax, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.21; • tax settlements and related interest income on tax settlements of $341 million, which had a favorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.39; and • amortization on the inventory fair value step-up associated with the Rockwell Collins Acquisition of $140 million, net of tax, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.16. Net Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations Attributable to Common Shareowners (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2021 2020 2019 Net income (loss) from discontinued operations attributable to common shareowners $ (33) $ (410) $ 2,027 Diluted earnings (loss) per share from discontinued operations $ (0.02) $ (0.30) $ 2.35 On April 3, 2020, we completed the separation of our commercial businesses, Carrier and Otis. Effective as of that date, the historical results of the Carrier and Otis segments were reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented. See “Note 3: Discontinued Operations” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. The change in Net income (loss) from discontinued operations attributable to common shareowners of $377 million and the related change in diluted earnings (loss) per share from discontinued operations of $0.28 in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to higher prior year costs associated with the separation of our commercial businesses, including debt extinguishment costs of $611 million, net of tax, in connection with the early repayment of outstanding principal, partially offset by prior year Carrier and Otis operating activity, as the Separation Transactions occurred on April 3, 2020. The change in Net income (loss) from discontinued operations attributable to common shareowners of $2.4 billion and the related change in diluted earnings (loss) per share from discontinued operations of $2.65 in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to prior year Carrier and Otis operating activity, as the Separation Transactions occurred on April 3, 2020, partially offset by higher prior year costs associated with the separation of our commercial businesses. Net income (loss) from discontinued operations for 2020 and 2019 includes $888 million, net of tax, and $1.3 billion, net of tax, respectively, of costs associated with the Company’s separation of its commercial businesses. Separation costs in 2020 primarily related to debt extinguishment costs of $611 million in connection with the early repayment of outstanding principal. 40 Table of Contents Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Shareowners (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2021 2020 2019 Net income (loss) attributable to common shareowners $ 3,864 $ (3,519) $ 5,537 Diluted earnings (loss) per share from operations $ 2.56 $ (2.59) $ 6.41 The changes in Net income (loss) attributable to common shareowners and diluted EPS from operations for 2021 compared to 2020 and for 2020 compared to 2019 were driven by the changes in continuing operations, as discussed above in Net Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations Attributable to Common Shareowners and the changes from discontinued operations, as discussed above in Net Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations Attributable to Common Shareowners. RESTRUCTURING COSTS (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Restructuring costs $ 143 $ 777 $ 245 Restructuring actions are an essential component of our operating margin improvement efforts and relate to both existing operations and recent mergers and acquisitions. Charges generally arise from severance related to workforce reductions and facility exit costs associated with the consolidation of field and manufacturing operations and costs to exit legacy programs. We continue to closely monitor the economic environment and may undertake further restructuring actions to keep our cost structure aligned with the demands of the prevailing market conditions. 2021 Actions. During 2021, we recorded net pre-tax restructuring charges of $137 million for restructuring efforts initiated in 2021, primarily related to severance costs in connection with ongoing cost reduction efforts, and to a much lesser extent, the exit and consolidation of facilities. We expect to incur additional restructuring charges of $62 million to complete these actions. We are targeting to complete the majority of actions initiated in 2021 by 2022. We expect recurring pre-tax savings in continuing operations related to these actions to reach approximately $140 million annually within one to two years. Approximately 60% of the total pre-tax charge will require cash payments, which we have funded and expect to continue to fund with cash generated from operations. During 2021, we had cash outflows of approximately $20 million related to 2021 actions. 2020 Actions. During 2021, we reversed net pre-tax restructuring costs of $23 million related to actions initiated in 2020. In 2020, we recorded net pre-tax restructuring charges of $770 million for actions initiated in 2020. These costs primarily related to severance and restructuring actions at Pratt & Whitney and Collins Aerospace in response to the impact on our operating results related to the economic environment primarily caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Raytheon Merger, and the ongoing cost reduction efforts. Additional restructuring charges to complete these actions are expected to be de minimis. We expect recurring pre-tax savings in continuing operations related to these actions to reach approximately $1.2 billion annually within two years of initiating these actions. Approximately 90% of the total pre-tax charge will require cash payments, which we have funded and expect to continue to fund with cash generated from operations. During 2021 and 2020, we had cash outflows of approximately $220 million and $400 million, respectively, related to the 2020 actions. In addition, during 2021, we recorded $29 million of net pre-tax restructuring costs for restructuring actions initiated in 2019 and prior. In 2020 and 2019, we recorded $7 million and $245 million, respectively, of net pre-tax restructuring costs for restructuring actions initiated in 2019 and prior. For additional discussion of restructuring, see “Note 14: Restructuring Costs” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. SEGMENT REVIEW We operate in four principal business segments: Collins Aerospace Systems (Collins Aerospace), Pratt & Whitney, Raytheon Intelligence & Space (RIS) and Raytheon Missiles & Defense (RMD). The results of RIS and RMD reflect the period subsequent to the completion of the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020. The historical results of Carrier and Otis are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. For a detailed description of our businesses, see “Business” within Item 1 of this Form 10-K. As previously announced, effective January 1, 2021, we reorganized certain product areas of our RIS and RMD businesses to more efficiently leverage our capabilities. The amounts and presentation of our business segments, including intersegment activity, set forth in this Form 10-K reflect this reorganization. The reorganization does not impact our previously reported Collins Aerospace Systems and Pratt & Whitney segment results, or our consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations or statements of cash flows. 41 Table of Contents We present a FAS/CAS operating adjustment outside of segment results, which represents the difference between the service cost component of our pension and postretirement benefit (PRB) expense under the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) requirements of U.S. GAAP and our pension and PRB expense under U.S. government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) primarily related to our RIS and RMD segments. While the ultimate liability for pension and PRB costs under FAS and CAS is similar, the pattern of cost recognition is different. Over time, we generally expect to recover the related RIS and RMD pension and PRB liabilities through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government. Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney segments generally record pension and PRB expense on a FAS basis. Segments are generally based on the management structure of the businesses and the grouping of similar operations, based on capabilities and technologies, where each management organization has general operating autonomy over diversified products and services. Segment Total Net Sales and Operating profit (loss) include intercompany sales and profit, which are ultimately eliminated within Eliminations and other, which also includes certain smaller non-reportable segments. Segment results exclude certain acquisition accounting adjustments, the FAS/CAS operating adjustment and certain corporate expenses, as further discussed below. We provide the organic change in Net sales and Operating profit (loss) for our segments as discussed above in “Results of Operations”. We believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they provide transparency to the underlying performance of our business, which allows for better year-over-year comparability. For Pratt & Whitney only, Other also includes the transactional impact of foreign exchange hedging at Pratt & Whitney Canada due to its significance to Pratt & Whitney’s overall operating results. Given the nature of our business, we believe that Total Net Sales and Operating profit (loss) (and the related operating profit (loss) margin percentage), which we disclose and discuss at the segment level, are most relevant to an understanding of management’s view of our segment performance, as described below. Total Net Sales. Total Net Sales by segment were as follows: (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Collins Aerospace Systems $ 18,449 $ 19,288 $ 26,028 Pratt & Whitney 18,150 16,799 20,902 Raytheon Intelligence & Space 15,180 11,069 — Raytheon Missiles & Defense 15,539 11,396 — Total segment 67,318 58,552 46,930 Eliminations and other (1) (2,930) (1,965) (1,581) Consolidated $ 64,388 $ 56,587 $ 45,349 (1) Includes the operating results of certain smaller non-reportable business segments. 2020 amounts include Forcepoint, LLC, which was acquired as part of the Raytheon Merger, and subsequently disposed of on January 8, 2021. Operating Profit (Loss). Operating profit (loss) by segment was as follows: (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Collins Aerospace Systems $ 1,759 $ 1,466 $ 4,508 Pratt & Whitney 454 (564) 1,801 Raytheon Intelligence & Space 1,833 1,020 — Raytheon Missiles & Defense 2,004 880 — Total segment 6,050 2,802 6,309 Eliminations and other (1) (133) (107) (140) Corporate expenses and other unallocated items (2) (552) (590) (367) FAS/CAS operating adjustment 1,796 1,106 — Acquisition accounting adjustments (3) (2,203) (5,100) (888) Consolidated $ 4,958 $ (1,889) $ 4,914 (1) Includes the operating results of certain smaller non-reportable business segments. 2020 amounts include Forcepoint, LLC, which was acquired as part of the Raytheon Merger, and subsequently disposed of on January 8, 2021. (2) Corporate expenses and other unallocated items in 2021 and 2020 include the net expenses related to the U.S. Army’s Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS) project. No amounts were recorded in 2019. (3) Acquisition accounting adjustments in 2020 includes the $3.2 billion goodwill impairment loss in the second quarter of 2020 related to two Collins Aerospace reporting units. Refer to “Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets” in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. 42 Table of Contents Included in segment Operating profit (loss) are Estimate at Completion (EAC) adjustments, which relate to changes in Operating profit (loss) and margin due to revisions to total estimated revenues and costs at completion. These changes may reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance, as well as changes in facts and assumptions related to contract options, contract modifications, incentive and award fees associated with program performance, customer activity levels, and other customer-directed changes. For a full description of our EAC process, refer to “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Given that we have thousands of individual contracts and given the types and complexity of the assumptions and estimates we must make on an on-going basis and the nature of the work required to be performed under our contracts, we have both favorable and unfavorable EAC adjustments in the ordinary course. We had the following aggregate EAC adjustments for the periods presented: (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Gross favorable $ 1,286 $ 994 $ 419 Gross unfavorable (1,176) (1,637) (488) Total net EAC adjustments $ 110 $ (643) $ (69) As a result of the Raytheon Merger, RIS’s and RMD’s long-term contracts that are accounted for on a percentage of completion basis, were reset to zero percent complete as of the merger date because only the unperformed portion of the contract at the merger date represented an obligation of the Company. This had the impact of reducing gross favorable and unfavorable EAC adjustments for these segments in the short term, most notably in 2020. The change in net EAC adjustments of $753 million in 2021 compared 2020 was primarily due to a favorable change in net EAC adjustments of $635 million at Pratt & Whitney, due to the absence of significant unfavorable contract adjustments in the prior year, and a favorable change in net EAC adjustments of $126 million at RIS and $40 million at RMD, primarily due to the Raytheon Merger. This was partially offset by an unfavorable change in net EAC adjustments of $48 million at Collins Aerospace spread across numerous individual programs with no individual or common significant driver. The change in net EAC adjustments of $574 million in 2020 compared 2019 was primarily due to an increase in net unfavorable EAC adjustments of $544 million at Pratt & Whitney, principally due to the economic and operating environment primarily driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Significant EAC adjustments, when they occur, are discussed in each business segment’s discussion below. Backlog and Defense Bookings. Total backlog was approximately $156 billion and $150 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. Our backlog by segment, which does not include intercompany backlog, was as follows at December 31: (dollars in billions) 2021 2020 Collins Aerospace Systems $ 24 $ 23 Pratt & Whitney 85 78 Raytheon Intelligence & Space 18 19 Raytheon Missiles & Defense 29 29 Other — 1 Total backlog $ 156 $ 150 Included in total backlog is defense backlog of $63 billion and $67 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our defense operations consist primarily of our RIS and RMD businesses and operations in the defense businesses within our Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney segments. Defense bookings were approximately $40 billion, $31 billion and $17 billion for 2021, 2020 and 2019 respectively. Backlog, which is equivalent to our remaining performance obligations (RPO) for our sales contracts, represents the aggregate dollar value of firm orders for which products have not been provided or service has not been performed and excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering-type contracts (e.g., IDIQ type contracts). Backlog generally increases with bookings and generally decreases as sales are recognized on these bookings and is affected by changes in foreign exchange rates, as well as contract cancellations and terminations as discussed further below. We believe defense bookings are an important measure of future performance for our defense operations and are an indicator of potential future changes in these operations’ Total Net Sales, because we cannot record revenues under a new contract without first having a booking in the current or a preceding period. Defense bookings generally represent the dollar value of new external defense contracts awarded to us during the reporting period and include firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated. 43 Table of Contents Defense bookings exclude unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering-type contracts (e.g., IDIQ type contracts), and are reduced for contract cancellations and terminations of bookings recognized in the current period. We reflect contract cancellations and terminations from prior year bookings, as well as the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, directly as an adjustment to backlog in the period in which the cancellation or termination occurs and the impact is determinable. Contract cancellations and terminations also include contract underruns on cost-type programs. Collins Aerospace Systems % Change (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 2021 compared with 2020 2020 compared with 2019 Net sales $ 18,449 $ 19,288 $ 26,028 (4) % (26) % Operating profit 1,759 1,466 4,508 20 % (67) % Operating profit margins 9.5 % 7.6 % 17.3 % 2021 Compared with 2020 Factors Contributing to Total Change (dollars in millions) Organic (1) Acquisitions / Divestitures, net Restructuring Costs Other Total Change Net sales $ (574) $ (333) $ — $ 68 $ (839) Operating profit 653 (91) 320 (589) 293 2020 Compared with 2019 Factors Contributing to Total Change (dollars in millions) Organic (1) Acquisitions / Divestitures, net Restructuring Costs Other Total Change Net sales $ (6,554) $ (201) $ — $ 15 $ (6,740) Operating profit (3,598) (12) (258) 826 (3,042) (1) See “Segment Review” above for definition of organic. A reconciliation of these measures to reported U.S. GAAP amounts is provided in the table above. 2021 Compared with 2020 The organic sales decrease of $0.6 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily relates to lower commercial aerospace OEM sales of $0.8 billion, predominately due to wide body volume declines principally driven by lower 787 deliveries. This was partially offset by higher commercial aerospace aftermarket sales of $0.3 billion primarily due to an increase in flight hours and aircraft fleet utilization as commercial aerospace continues to recover from the prior year’s unfavorable economic environment principally driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Military sales were down slightly in 2021 compared to 2020. The organic profit increase of $0.7 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to higher commercial aerospace operating profit of $0.5 billion and lower selling, general and administrative expenses of $0.1 billion. The higher commercial aerospace operating profit was principally driven by the higher commercial aerospace aftermarket sales discussed above, the benefit of cost reduction initiatives, the absence of $157 million of prior year significant unfavorable adjustments, and a $52 million favorable impact from a contract-related matter in 2021. The significant unfavorable adjustments in 2020 were primarily driven by the expected acceleration of fleet retirements of a certain aircraft type. The lower selling, general and administrative expenses were primarily driven by the absence of a $125 million charge for allowances for credit losses in 2020, primarily related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Included in organic profit in 2020 was $72 million of foreign government wage subsidies related to COVID-19. The decrease in net sales and operating profit due to acquisitions / divestitures, net primarily relates to the sale of our Collins Aerospace military GPS and space-based precision optics businesses in the third quarter of 2020, as further discussed in “Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The decrease in Other operating profit of $0.6 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily relates to the absence of prior year gains of $595 million on the sales of the Collins Aerospace military GPS and space-based precision optics businesses. 2020 Compared with 2019 The organic sales decrease of $6.6 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily relates to lower commercial aerospace OEM sales of $3.7 billion and lower commercial aerospace aftermarket sales of $3.4 billion, including declines across all aftermarket sales channels. These reductions were primarily due to the economic environment principally driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in lower flight hours, aircraft fleet utilization and commercial OEM deliveries. This decrease was 44 Table of Contents partially offset by higher military sales of $0.6 billion. Included in the organic sales decrease were lower commercial aerospace OEM and aftermarket sales of approximately $1.0 billion related to the Boeing 737 Max program and fewer upgrades due to certain regulatory mandates that were primarily completed in early 2020. The organic profit decrease of $3.6 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to lower commercial aerospace operating profit of $4.0 billion principally driven by the lower commercial aerospace OEM and aftermarket sales volume discussed above. Included in the lower commercial OEM operating profit were $157 million of significant unfavorable adjustments principally driven by the expected acceleration of fleet retirements of a certain aircraft. The decrease was partially offset by lower research and development expenses of $0.2 billion, which includes the impact of cost reduction initiatives. Included in the operating profit decrease was $125 million of increased estimates of expected credit losses due to customer bankruptcies and additional allowances for credit losses. Included in organic profit in 2020 was other income of $72 million related to foreign government wage subsidies due to COVID-19. The decrease in net sales and operating profit due to acquisitions / divestitures, net primarily relates to the sale of our Collins Aerospace military GPS and space-based precision optics businesses in the third quarter of 2020. The increase in other operating profit of $0.8 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily relates to gains of $595 million on the sales of the Collins Aerospace businesses discussed above, the absence of prior year amortization of inventory fair value step-up associated with the Rockwell Acquisition of $181 million and the absence of a prior year loss on the sale of a business of $25 million. Pratt & Whitney % Change (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 2021 compared with 2020 2020 compared with 2019 Net sales $ 18,150 $ 16,799 $ 20,902 8 % (20) % Operating profit (loss) 454 (564) 1,801 180 % (131) % Operating profit (loss) margins 2.5 % (3.4) % 8.6 % 2021 Compared with 2020 Factors Contributing to Total Change (dollars in millions) Organic (1) Acquisitions / Divestitures, net Restructuring Costs Other Total Change Net sales $ 1,255 $ — $ — $ 96 $ 1,351 Operating profit (loss) 702 — 173 143 1,018 2020 Compared with 2019 Factors Contributing to Total Change (dollars in millions) Organic (1) Acquisitions / Divestitures, net Restructuring Costs Other Total Change Net sales $ (4,080) $ — $ — $ (23) $ (4,103) Operating profit (loss) (2,126) — (47) (192) (2,365) (1) See “Segment Review” above for definition of organic. A reconciliation of these measures to reported U.S. GAAP amounts is provided in the table above. 2021 Compared with 2020 The organic sales increase of $1.3 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily reflects higher commercial aftermarket sales of $1.2 billion, primarily due to an increase in shop visits and related spare part sales driven by the recovery from the prior year’s unfavorable economic environment largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and higher commercial OEM sales of $0.1 billion. Prior year commercial aftermarket sales include unfavorable EAC adjustments of $0.4 billion, discussed further below. These increases were partially offset by lower military sales of $0.1 billion in 2021 compared to 2020. The organic profit increase of $0.7 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily driven by higher commercial aerospace operating profit of $0.7 billion principally due to favorable change in net EAC adjustments of $0.6 billion, and lower selling, general and administrative expenses of $0.1 billion. The higher commercial aerospace operating profit also includes the impact of the aftermarket sales volume increase discussed above, which was partially offset by lower commercial OEM operating profit due to unfavorable mix on the increased sales volume. The lower year-over-year unfavorable commercial aerospace EAC adjustments were principally driven by prior year unfavorable EAC adjustments discussed below. The lower selling, general and administrative expenses were primarily driven by the absence of a $257 million charge in the prior year for allowances for 45 Table of Contents credit losses, partially offset by higher employee-related costs. The change in organic operating profit was also impacted by $106 million of lower government wage subsidies, and the absence of prior year unfavorable EAC adjustments on certain commercial aftermarket and military programs, as discussed below. The increase in other operating profit of $0.1 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily driven by the absence of an $89 million impairment of commercial aircraft program assets and $43 million of reserves related to a commercial financing arrangement, both recorded in the prior year. 2020 Compared with 2019 The organic sales decrease of $4.1 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily reflects lower commercial aftermarket sales of $3.8 billion, due to a significant reduction in shop visits and related spare part sales, and lower commercial OEM sales of $1.1 billion, primarily due to a significant reduction in commercial engine deliveries, all principally driven by the economic and operating environment primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These declines were partially offset by higher military sales of $0.8 billion primarily driven by an increase in F135 engine sales and aftermarket growth on multiple platforms. Included in the lower commercial aftermarket sales is a $0.4 billion impact to sales from the net unfavorable contract adjustments discussed further below. The organic profit decrease of $2.1 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily driven by lower commercial aftermarket operating profit of $2.4 billion driven by the sales volume decrease discussed above, unfavorable mix, a $334 million unfavorable EAC adjustment on a commercial engine aftermarket contract due to lower estimated revenues driven by a change in the estimated maintenance coverage period, an unfavorable EAC adjustment of $129 million related to lower estimated revenues due to the restructuring of a customer contract, and $86 million related to an unfavorable EAC adjustment and increased allowances for warranty for legacy fleet related retrofits. The decrease was also driven by higher selling, general and administrative expenses of $0.2 billion primarily driven by $257 million of increased estimates of expected credit losses due to customer bankruptcies and additional allowances for credit losses, primarily related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This decrease in organic profit was partially offset by lower research and development costs of $0.3 billion, which includes the impact of cost reduction initiatives, and other income of $153 million related to foreign government wage subsidies due to COVID-19. Included in organic profit was an increase in net unfavorable EAC adjustments of $544 million, which included the unfavorable EAC adjustments discussed above and significant net unfavorable EAC adjustments of $62 million based on a portfolio review of our commercial aftermarket programs in the second quarter of 2020 in consideration of the estimated lower flight hours, a change in the estimated number of shop visits and the related amount of estimated costs. Also included was an unfavorable EAC adjustment of $44 million in the second quarter of 2020 on a military program primarily driven by a shift in estimated overhead costs due to the lower commercial engine activity discussed above. The decrease in other operating profit of $0.2 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to an $89 million impairment of commercial aircraft program assets in the current year and $43 million of reserves related to a commercial financing arrangement in the current year. Defense Bookings – In addition to a number of smaller bookings, Pratt & Whitney booked the following significant bookings in 2021: $1.7 billion for F135 sustainment contracts, $435 million for an F119 sustainment contract, $255 million for an F135 production contract and $212 million for F100 engines for an international customer.

The increase in net sales due to acquisitions / divestitures, net primarily relates to the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020. The increase in operating profit of $0.8 billion and the related increase in operating profit margins in 2021 compared to 2020, were primarily due to the change in Acquisitions / divestitures, net of $399 million, primarily due to the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020, an increase in mix and other performance of $292 million primarily due to a $239 million gain, net of transaction costs, on the sale of RIS’s global training and services business in December 2021, as further discussed in “Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K, and the net favorable change in EAC adjustments of $132 million, which was primarily driven by the absence of $124 million of unfavorable EAC adjustments related to a domestic classified fixed price development program in 2020. 2020 Compared with 2019 The increase in net sales of $11.1 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 was due to the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020. The increase in operating profit of $1.0 billion and the related increase in operating profit margins in 2020 compared to 2019 were due to the Raytheon Merger. Included in operating profit in 2020 were $124 million of unfavorable EAC adjustments for loss reserves related to a domestic classified fixed price development program in a net loss position, of which $87 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020. Backlog and Bookings – Backlog was $18 billion at December 31, 2021 compared to $19 billion at December 31, 2020. Included in the decrease in backlog was a $0.9 billion adjustment related to the sale of RIS’s global training and services business discussed above. In 2021, RIS booked $4.8 billion on a number of classified contracts, $672 million of Electro-Optical Infrared (EO/IR) products and services contracts in the fourth quarter of 2021 including the Electro-Optical Distributed Aperture System (EODAS) for the F35 Joint Strike Fighter program, $419 million on the Next Generation Jammer (NGJ) Mid-Band Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP) contract with the U.S. Navy, $365 million on the Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System (STARS) program for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), $227 million on a missile warning and defense contract, $211 million to provide additional upgrades to the Global Positioning System Next Generation Operational Control System (GPS OCX) program for the U.S. Air Force, $199 million on an international tactical airborne radar sustainment contract, and $185 million on an international training contract with the U.K. Royal Navy.

The increase in net sales due to acquisitions / divestitures, net relates to the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020. The increase in operating profit of $1.1 billion and the related increase in operating profit margins in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to a change in mix and other performance of $610 million, primarily driven by the absence of an unfavorable profit impact of $516 million in 2020 related to certain international contracts as further described below, and a change in acquisitions / divestitures, net of $521 million due to the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020. 2020 Compared with 2019 The increase in net sales of $11.4 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 was due to the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020. The increase in operating profit of $0.9 billion and the related increase in operating profit margins in 2020 compared to 2019 was due to the Raytheon Merger. Included in operating profit in 2020 was an unfavorable net impact of $516 million related to certain international contracts as further described below, and a $25 million net favorable EAC adjustment due to a revised estimate in costs to complete an industrial cooperation agreement obligation on multiple contracts for an international customer based upon an agreement signed in the fourth quarter of 2020. In the fourth quarter of 2020, RMD reversed $119 million of sales for work performed subsequent to the date of the Raytheon Merger through the end of the third quarter of 2020, and the related operating profit, on our direct commercial sales contracts for precision guided munitions with a certain Middle East customer, for which we have not yet obtained regulatory approval. Due to the U.S. presidential and congressional elections and the resulting uncertainty surrounding U.S. foreign policy on direct commercial sales for precision guided munitions with this customer, we determined that it was no longer probable that we will be able to obtain regulatory approvals for these contracts. RMD also recognized an unfavorable profit impact of $516 million related to these contracts, primarily related to inventory reserves, contract asset impairments and recognition of supplier related obligations related to termination liability, which we do not expect to be utilized or otherwise directed to other customers. In addition, we reversed $755 million of backlog on these contracts. Backlog and Bookings – Backlog was $29 billion at both December 31, 2021 and 2020. In 2021, RMD booked $3.2 billion on a number of classified contracts, including approximately $2 billion for the Long Range Standoff (LRSO) Weapon System Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) contract for the U.S. Air Force. RMD also booked $1,315 million for the NGI program for the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), $1,088 million for the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) for the U.S. Air Force and Navy and international customers, $729 million for Standard Missile-2 (SM-2) for the U.S. Navy and international customers, $627 million for Evolved Seasparrow Missile (ESSM) for the U.S. Navy and international customers, $432 million to provide Guidance Enhanced Missiles (GEM-T) for an international customer, $327 million for AIM-9X Sidewinder short-range air-to-air missiles for the U.S. Navy and Air Force and international customers, $291 million for Stinger missiles for international customers, $247 million to provide Patriot engineering services support for the U.S. Army and international customers, $242 million on the Army Navy/Transportable Radar Surveillance-Model 2 (AN/TPY-2) radar program for the MDA, $213 million for StormBreaker for the U.S. Air Force and Navy, $175 million to provide Patriot technical assistance for an international customer, and $164 million for the Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR) program for the U.S. Navy. 48 Table of Contents Eliminations and other Eliminations and other reflects the elimination of sales, other income and operating profit transacted between segments, as well as the operating results of certain smaller non-reportable business segments, including Forcepoint, which was acquired as part of the Raytheon Merger and subsequently disposed of on January 8, 2021, as further discussed in “Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Net Sales Operating Profit (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 2019 Inter-segment eliminations (1) $ (2,945) $ (2,492) $ (1,594) $ (86) $ (79) $ (208) Other non-reportable segments 15 527 13 (47) (28) 68 Eliminations and other $ (2,930) $ (1,965) $ (1,581) $ (133) $ (107) $ (140) (1) The increase in inter-segment eliminations sales in 2020 compared to 2019, was primarily due to the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020. The decrease in other non-reportable segment sales and the change in other non-reportable segment operating profit in 2021 compared to 2020, was primarily due to the sale of our Forcepoint business in the first quarter of 2021. The increase in other non-reportable segment sales in 2020 compared to 2019, was primarily related to Forcepoint sales. The decrease in other non-reportable segments operating profit in 2020 compared to 2019, was primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by operating profit related to Forcepoint. Corporate expenses and other unallocated items Corporate expenses and other unallocated items consists of costs and certain other unallowable corporate costs not considered part of management’s evaluation of reportable segment operating performance including restructuring and merger costs related to the Raytheon Merger, net costs associated with corporate research and development, including the Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS) program which was acquired as part of the Raytheon Merger, and certain reserves. See Restructuring Costs, above, for a more detailed discussion of our restructuring costs. (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Corporate expenses and other unallocated items $ (552) $ (590) $ (367) The change in Corporate expenses and other unallocated items of $38 million for 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily driven by a decrease in merger-related costs related to the Raytheon Merger of $148 million and lower restructuring costs of $112 million, partially offset by an accrual of $147 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 related to the ongoing DOJ investigation into contract pricing matters at RMD and an increase in net expenses related to the LTAMDS project. The change in corporate expenses and other unallocated items of $223 million in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily driven by increased restructuring costs of $201 million, $130 million of net expenses related to the LTAMDS project acquired as part of the Raytheon Merger and an increase in merger-related costs related to the Raytheon Merger of $82 million, partially offset by $40 million of merger-related costs for the Rockwell Acquisition in 2019 and other unallocated items with no individual or common significant driver. FAS/CAS operating adjustment The segment results of RIS and RMD include pension and PRB expense as determined under U.S. government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which we generally recover through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government. The difference between our CAS expense and the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) service cost attributable to these segments under U.S. GAAP is the FAS/CAS operating adjustment. The FAS/CAS operating adjustment results in consolidated pension expense in operating profit equal to the service cost component of FAS expense under U.S. GAAP. The segment results of Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney generally include FAS service cost. The CAS expense calculation is different from the FAS requirements and calculation methodology. While the ultimate liability for pension costs under FAS and CAS is similar, the pattern of cost recognition is different. Our CAS pension expense is comprised primarily of CAS service cost, as well as amortization amounts resulting from demographic or economic experience different than expected, changes in assumptions, or changes in plan provisions. Unlike FAS, CAS expense is only recognized for plans that are not fully funded. Consequently, if plans become or cease to be fully funded under CAS due to our asset or liability experience, our CAS expense will change accordingly. 49 Table of Contents The components of the FAS/CAS operating adjustment were as follows: (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 FAS service cost (expense) $ (405) $ (354) $ — CAS expense 2,201 1,460 — FAS/CAS operating adjustment $ 1,796 $ 1,106 $ — The change in our FAS/CAS operating adjustment of $690 million in 2021 compared to 2020 was driven by a $741 million increase in CAS expense, partially offset by a $51 million increase in FAS service cost. The increase in our CAS expense was primarily due to the Raytheon Merger. The change in our FAS/CAS operating adjustment of $1,106 million in 2020 compared to 2019 was due to the Raytheon Merger. In December 2020, we approved a change to the Raytheon Company domestic defined benefit pension plans for non-union participants to cease future benefit accruals based on an employee’s years of service and compensation effective December 31, 2022. The plan change does not impact participants’ historical benefit accruals. Benefits for service after December 31, 2022 will be based on a cash balance formula. In response to the economic environment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress passed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA) in March 2021 which included pension funding relief provisions, as further discussed in “Cash Flow - Operating Activities”. These pension funding relief provisions are expected to result in decreases to CAS expense, and the related recovery under our contracts, for our U.S. qualified pension plans beginning in 2022, as the interest rates used to determine pension funding requirements for these plans are also used in determining CAS expense. Acquisition accounting adjustments Acquisition accounting adjustments include the amortization of acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions, the amortization of the property, plant and equipment fair value adjustment acquired through acquisitions and the amortization of customer contractual obligations related to loss making or below market contracts acquired. These adjustments are not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment results. The components of Acquisition accounting adjustments were as follows: (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Goodwill impairment charge $ — $ (3,183) $ — Amortization of acquired intangibles (2,404) (2,142) (1,211) Amortization of property, plant and equipment fair value adjustment (111) (69) (23) Amortization of customer contractual obligations related to acquired loss-making and below-market contracts 312 294 346 Acquisition accounting adjustments $ (2,203) $ (5,100) $ (888) Acquisition accounting adjustments related to acquisitions in each segment were as follows: (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Collins Aerospace Systems $ (641) $ (3,926) $ (605) Pratt & Whitney (160) (117) (283) Raytheon Intelligence & Space (563) (394) — Raytheon Missiles & Defense (838) (607) — Total segment (2,202) (5,044) (888) Eliminations and other (1) (56) — Acquisition accounting adjustments $ (2,203) $ (5,100) $ (888) The change in the Acquisition accounting adjustments of $2.9 billion in 2021 compared to 2020, is primarily driven by the absence of the $3.2 billion goodwill impairment loss in the second quarter of 2020 related to two Collins Aerospace reporting units, partially offset by an increase of $0.4 billion for acquisition accounting adjustments related to the Raytheon Merger, primarily due to the timing of the merger in the prior year. Included in Acquisition accounting adjustments in 2021 was $116 million of amortization of customer contractual obligations due to the accelerated liquidation of below-market contract reserves 50 Table of Contents at Collins Aerospace driven by the termination of two customer contracts. Refer to “Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information on the goodwill impairment. The change in the Acquisition accounting adjustments of $4.2 billion in 2020 compared to 2019, is primarily driven by the $3.2 billion goodwill impairment in the second quarter of 2020 related to two Collins Aerospace reporting units and an increase of $1.1 billion related to the Raytheon Merger, primarily related to the amortization of acquired intangibles. LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 Cash and cash equivalents $ 7,832 $ 8,802 Total debt 31,485 31,823 Total equity 74,664 73,852 Total capitalization (total debt plus total equity) 106,149 105,675 Total debt to total capitalization 30 % 30 % We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. Our principal source of liquidity is cash flows from operating activities. In addition to operating cash flows, other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include: capital expenditures, customer financing requirements, investments in and divestitures of businesses, dividends, common stock repurchases, pension funding, access to the commercial paper markets, adequacy of available bank lines of credit, redemptions of debt and the ability to attract long-term capital at satisfactory terms. We had $7.0 billion available under our various credit facilities at December 31, 2021. Although our business has been and will continue to be impacted by COVID-19, we currently believe we have sufficient liquidity to withstand the potential impacts. At December 31, 2021, we had Cash and cash equivalents of $7.8 billion, of which approximately 34% was held by RTC’s foreign subsidiaries. We manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. The Company does not intend to reinvest certain undistributed earnings of its international subsidiaries that have been previously taxed in the U.S. Taxes associated with the future remittance of these earnings have been recorded. For the remainder of the Company’s undistributed international earnings, unless tax effective to repatriate, RTC will continue to permanently reinvest these earnings. Historically, our strong credit ratings and financial position have enabled us to issue long-term debt at favorable market rates. As of December 31, 2021, our maximum commercial paper borrowing limit was $5.0 billion as the commercial paper is backed by our $5.0 billion revolving credit agreement. We had no commercial paper borrowings as of December 31, 2021. The daily average amount of short-term commercial paper borrowings outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2021 was $175 million. We use our commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes, including the funding of potential acquisitions, pension contributions, debt refinancing, dividend payments and repurchases of our common stock. The commercial paper notes have original maturities of not more than 90 days from the date of issuance. As of December 31, 2021, we had revolving credit agreements with various banks permitting aggregate borrowings of up to $7.0 billion, consisting of a $5.0 billion revolving credit agreement, which matures in April 2025, and a $2.0 billion revolving credit agreement, which we renewed in May 2021 and expires in May 2022. As of December 31, 2021, there were no borrowings outstanding under these agreements. We have an existing universal shelf registration statement, which we filed with the Securities and E xchange Commission (SEC) on September 27, 2019, for an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities for future issuance, subject to our internal limitations on the amount of debt to be issued under this shelf registration statement. The Company offers a voluntary supply chain finance (SCF) program with a global financial institution which enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables from the Company to the financial institution at a rate that leverages our credit rating, which might be beneficial to them. Our suppliers’ participation in the SCF program does not impact or change our terms and conditions with those suppliers, and therefore, we have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to participate in the program. In addition, we provide no guarantees or otherwise pay for any of the costs of the program incurred by those suppliers that choose to participate, and have no direct financial relationship with the financial institution, as it relates to the program. As such, the SCF program does not impact our overall liquidity. We believe our cash on hand and future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs. Further, we continue to have access to the commercial paper markets and our existing credit facilities, and our ability to obtain debt or 51 Table of Contents equity financing, as well as the availability under committed credit lines, provides additional potential sources of liquidity should they be required or appropriate. Cash Flow - Operating Activities (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Net cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations $ 7,142 $ 4,334 $ 5,821 Net cash flows (used in) provided by operating activities from discontinued operations (71) (728) 3,062 2021 Compared with 2020 Operating Activities - Continuing Operations Cash generated from operating activities in 2021 was $2.8 billion higher than 2020. This increase was primarily due to higher net income of $4.1 billion after adjustments for depreciation and amortization, deferred income tax provision, stock compensation costs, net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit, the goodwill impairment charge and debt extinguishment cost s, as well as lower pension and PRB contributions to trusts of $1.0 billion in 2021 compared to 2020. This was partially offset by an unfavorable change in working capital of $1.1 billion in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to activity at the RIS and RMD segments in the first quarter of 2021 with no comparable activity in the first quarter of 2020 as a result of the Raytheon Merger. This unfavorable change in working capital at RIS and RMD includes a cash outflow for accounts payable and accrued liabili ties due to the timing of incentive compensation payments. Also included in the total unfavorable change in working capital was an increase in Contract assets principally driven by sales in excess of billings at Pratt & Whitney and contractual billing terms on U.S. government and foreign military sales contracts at RMD, and growth in accounts payable and accounts receivable at Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney due to an increase in sales volume as commercial aerospace recovers. The Company enters into various factoring agreements with third-party financial institutions to sell certain of its receivables. Factoring activity resulted in a decrease of approximately $0.2 billion in cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities of $1.3 billion during the year ended December 31, 2020. The year over year favorable impact from factoring activity was primarily due to the significant decline in sales volume in 2020 principally driven by the economic environment primarily due to COVID-19. Factoring activity includes amounts factored on certain aerospace receivables at the customers’ request for which we are compensated by the customer for the extended collection cycle. 2020 Compared with 2019 Operating Activities - Continuing Operations Cash generated from operating activities in 2020 was $1.5 billion lower than 2019. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in net income after adjustments for depreciation and amortization, the 2020 goodwill impairment charge, the deferred income tax provision, stock compensation costs and net periodic pension and other post retirement income of $2.0 billion primarily driven by a decrease at Pratt & Whitney and Collins Aerospace as a result of the economic environment primarily driven by COVID-19, partially offset by net income from RIS and RMD following the Raytheon Merger. Included in the decrease in operating cash flows was an increase in pension contributions, as further discussed below, and an unfavorable impact from accounts payable primarily at Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney due to a decline in volume principally driven by the economic environment primarily driven by COVID-19, which was partially offset by a favorable change in inventory at Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney due to the decline in volume and a favorable change in Accounts receivable and Contract assets due to the timing of billings and collections in 2020 across our segments. Factoring activity resulted in a decrease of approximately $1.3 billion in cash generated from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to an increase of approximately $0.3 billion in cash generated from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease in factoring activity was driven by a decrease in factoring levels at Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney primarily driven by lower sales volume. We made pension and PRB contributions to trusts of $59 million, $1,025 million, and $55 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The contributions in 2020 include discretionary contributions of $801 million. We make both required and discretionary contributions to our pension plans. Required contributions are primarily determined by Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) funding rules, which require us to fully fund our U.S qualified pension plans over a rolling seven-year period as determined annually based on the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA) calculated funded status at the beginning of each year. The funding requirements are primarily based on the year’s expected service cost and amortization of other previously unfunded liabilities, which are dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, the level of market interest rates and actuarial assumptions. We can contribute cash or RTC shares to our plans at our discretion, subject to applicable regulations. As of December 31, 2021, the total investment by the U.S. qualified pension plans in RTC shares was less than 1% of total plan assets. 52 Table of Contents In response to the economic environment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress passed the ARPA in March 2021, which included pension funding relief provisions. These provisions extend and expand upon existing pension funding relief, most notably by increasing the liability interest rates used to determine the required cash contributions for our U.S. qualified pension plans. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act passed by Congress in November 2021 further extended the interest rate pension funding relief provisions included in ARPA. As a result of these pension funding relief provisions, we do not currently expect cash contributions to be required for our U.S. qualified pension plans in the foreseeable future. Global pension and PRB cash funding requirements are expected to be approximately $0.4 billion annually in 2022, 2023, 2024, and 2025, which includes benefit payments to be paid directly by the company. Provisions enacted in the TCJA related to the capitalization for tax purposes of research and experimental expenditures became effective on January 1, 2022. If these provisions are not deferred beyond 2022, our tax payments will increase by an estimated $2 billion in 2022. Included in cash flows from operating activities are payments related to our operating lease obligations. See “Note 12: Leases” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for actual and expected payments on operating lease obligations. In addition, the majority of our cash flows for purchase obligations are classified as cash flows from operating activities. We expect future payments related to our purchase obligations to be $23.3 billion, $17.2 billion of which is payable in 2022. Purchase obligations include current amounts committed for the purchase of goods and services under legally enforceable contracts or purchase orders, and do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future. Approximately 50% of our purchase obligations described above represent purchase orders for products to be delivered under firm contracts with the U.S. government for which we have full recourse under customary contract termination clauses. Operating Activities - Discontinued Operations The $657 million increase in cash flows provided by operating activities from discontinued operations in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily driven by the absence of prior year separation costs as the Separation Transactions occurred on April 3, 2020. Th e $3.8 billion decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities from discontinued operations in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily relates to a decrease in net income from discontinued operations driven by the absence of operating activity for the majority of the year, as the Separation Transactions occurred on April 3, 2020. Cash Flow - Investing Activities (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Net cash flows (used in) provided by investing activities from continuing operations $ (1,364) $ 3,343 $ (2,676) Net cash flows used in investing activities from discontinued operations — (241) (416) Our investing activities primarily include investments in/dispositions of businesses, capital expenditures, payments related to our collaboration intangible assets and contractual rights to provide product on new aircraft platforms, settlements of derivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments, and cash investments in Customer financing assets. 2021 Compared with 2020 Investing Activities - Continuing Operations The $4.7 billion change in cash flows (used in) provided by investing activities in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily relates to the absence of cash acquired in the Raytheon Merger in the prior year of $3.2 billion, and investments in and dispositions of businesses, as discussed below. 2020 Compared with 2019 Investing Activities - Continuing Operations The $6.0 billion change in cash flows (used in) provided by investing activities in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily relates to cash acquired in the Raytheon Merger of $3.2 billion, the sale of our Collins Aerospace military Global Positioning System (GPS) and space-based precision optics businesses for $2.3 billion in cash proceeds, and a net increase from customer financing assets of $747 million, as discussed below, partially offset by the Blue Canyon Technologies acquisition of $419 million. Investments in businesses in 2021 of $1.1 billion primarily related to the acquisitions of FlightAware at Collins Aerospace and SEAKR Engineering Inc. at RIS. Investments in businesses in 2020 of $419 million primarily related to the acquisition of Blue Canyon Technologies at RIS. Investments in businesses in 2019 were not material. For additional detail, see “Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Dispositions of businesses in 2021 of $1.9 billion, net of cash transferred, primarily related to the sale of our Forcepoint business and the sale of our global training and services business within RIS. Dispositions of businesses in 2020 of $2.6 billion, net of cash transferred, primarily related to the sale of our Collins Aerospace military GPS and space-based precision optics businesses. Dispositions of business in 2019 of $134 million, net of cash transferred, primarily consisted of the business sold in 53 Table of Contents connection with the Rockwell Acquisition. For additional detail, see “Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Capital expenditures were $2.1 billion, $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Capital expenditures increased $339 million in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to increases at RIS and RMD principally driven by the Raytheon Merger and increases at Pratt & Whitney. Capital expenditures decreased $73 million in 2020 from 2019 as reductions at Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney were largely offset by increased capital expenditures driven by the Raytheon Merger. Customer financing assets payments were $231 million, $280 million, and $787 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in payments in 2021 compared to 2020 was due to fewer engines added to our leased asset pool, partially offset by increased customer financing. The decrease in payments in 2020 compared to 2019 was due to fewer engines added to our leased asset pool. Customer financing assets receipts were $389 million, $368 million and $128 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Receipts in 2021 were relatively consistent with 2020, as both periods included similar sale and leaseback transactions for the sale of equipment. The increase in receipts in 2020 compared to 2019 was driven by the sale and leaseback transaction in 2020. Refer to “Note 12: Leases” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional discussion of these transactions. In 2021, 2020, and 2019 we increased our collaboration intangible assets by approximately $188 million, $172 million, $351 million, respectively, which primarily relates to payments made under our 2012 agreement to acquire Rolls-Royce’s collaboration interests in International Aero Engines AG (IAE). At December 31, 2021, we had commercial aerospace financing and other contractual commitments, including exclusivity and collaboration payment commitments, of approximately $15.6 billion, on a gross basis before reduction for our collaboration partners’ share. Refer to “Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further details on our commercial aerospace financing and other contractual commitments. As discussed in “Note 15: Financial Instruments” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K, we enter into derivative instruments primarily for risk management purposes, including derivatives designated as hedging instruments and those utilized as economic hedges. We operate internationally and in the normal course of business, are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. These fluctuations can increase the costs of financing, investing and operating the business. We have used derivative instruments, including swaps, forward contracts and options to manage certain foreign currency, interest rate and commodity price exposures. During 2021, 2020, and 2019 we had net cash (payments) receipts of $(16) million, $(32) million, and $342 million, respectively, from the settlement of these derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments. Investing Activities - Discontinued Operations The $241 million decrease in cash flows used in investing activities from discontinued operations in 2021 compared to 2020 was due to the fact that the Separation Transactions occurred on April 3, 2020. The $175 million decrease in cash flows used in investing activities from discontinued operations in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily relates to a reduction in capital expenditures at Carrier and Otis of approximately $300 million, partially offset by a reduction in investment cash of approximately $135 million. Cash Flow - Financing Activities (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Net cash flows used in financing activities from continuing operations $ (6,756) $ (3,860) $ (1,913) Net cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities from discontinued operations 71 (1,414) (2,651) Our financing activities primarily include the issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, payment of dividends and stock repurchases. 2021 Compared with 2020 Financing Activities- Continuing Operations The $2.9 billion change in cash flows used in financing activities in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily relates to an increase in share repurchases of $2.3 billion, as discussed below. In addition, in 2021, we had debt repayments, including debt extinguishment costs, of $4.9 billion and long-term debt issuances of $4.1 billion. 2020 Compared with 2019 - Financing Activities- Continuing Operations The $1.9 billion change in cash flows used in financing activities in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily relates to increases in long-term debt repayments of $13.4 billion, a $4.4 billion change in net cash transfers to discontinued operations, an increase in short-term borrowing repayments of $2.9 billion, and an increase in dividends paid on common stock of $0.3 billion, partially 54 Table of Contents offset by an increase in long-term debt issuances of $19.2 billion. The 2020 debt issuances reflect debt incurred by Carrier and Otis of approximately $6 billion and $11 billion, respectively. The net proceeds of these issuances and draws were primarily utilized by UTC to extinguish Raytheon Technologies short-term and long-term debt in order to not exceed the maximum applicable net indebtedness required by the Raytheon Merger Agreement. Included in cash flows from financing activities are payments related to our long term debt, including both interest and principal payments. A summary of our long-term debt commitments as of December 31, 2021 was as follows: Payments Due by Period (dollars in millions) 2022 2023 2024 Thereafter Long-term debt—principal $ 13 $ 588 $ 1,270 $ 29,429 Long-term debt—future interest 1,250 1,257 1,221 15,745 Our share repurchases were as follows for the years ended December 31: (dollars in millions; shares in thousands) 2021 2020 2019 $ Shares $ Shares $ Shares Shares of Common Stock repurchased $ 2,327 28,003 $ 47 330 $ 151 1,133 At December 31, 2021, management had remaining authority to repurchase approximately $6.0 billion of our common stock under the December 7, 2021 share repurchase program. Under this program, shares may be purchased on the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, under accelerated share repurchase programs, and under plans complying with Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We may also reacquire shares outside of the program from time to time in connection with the surrender of shares to cover taxes on vesting of restricted stock and as required under our employee savings plan. Our ability to repurchase shares is subject to applicable law. Our Board of Directors authorized the following cash dividends for the years ended December 31: (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2021 2020 2019 Dividends paid per share of Common Stock $ 2.005 $ 2.160 $ 2.940 Total dividends paid $ 2,957 $ 2,732 $ 2,442 On February 11, 2022, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.51 per share payable March 24, 2022 to shareowners of record at the close of business on February 25, 2022. Financing Activities - Discontinued Operations Cash flows provided by financing activities from discontinued operations in 2021 were not significant as the Separation Transactions occurred on April 3, 2020. The $1.2 billion decrease in cash flows used in financing activities from discontinued operations in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily relates to $703 million of debt extinguishment costs related to the early repayment of debt in 2020 and cash distributions made to Carrier and Otis of $2.8 billion, which were more than offset by a change in net transfer activity of $4.5 billion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the Consolidated Financial Statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. The most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below. Actual results in these areas could differ from management’s estimates. Long-Term Contract Accounting. We recognize revenue on an over-time basis for substantially all defense contracts and certain long-term aerospace aftermarket contracts. We measure progress toward completion of these contracts on a percentage of completion basis, generally using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion. Contract costs are incurred over a period of time, which can be several years, and the estimation of these costs requires management’s judgment. We review our Estimate at Completion (EACs) on significant contracts on a periodic basis and for others, no less than annually or when a change in circumstances warrant a modification to a previous estimate. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of the Company’s performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment by management on a contract by contract basis. As part of this process, management reviews information including, but not limited to, any outstanding key contract matters, progress towards completion and the related program schedule, identified risks and opportunities and the related changes in estimates of 55 Table of Contents revenues and costs. The risks and opportunities relate to management’s judgment about the ability and cost to achieve the schedule, consideration of customer-directed delays or reductions in scheduled deliveries, technical requirements, customer activity levels, such as flight hours or aircraft landings, and related variable consideration. Management’s judgment related to these considerations has become increasingly more significant given the economic environment primarily caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Management must make assumptions and estimates regarding contract revenue and costs, including estimates of labor productivity and availability, the complexity and scope of the work to be performed, the availability and cost of materials, the length of time to complete the performance obligation, execution by our subcontractors, the availability and timing of funding from our customer, overhead cost rates, and current and past maintenance cost and frequency driven by estimated aircraft and engine utilization and estimated useful lives of components, among others. In particular, fixed-price development programs involve significant management judgment, as development contracts by nature have elements that have not been done before and thus, are highly subject to future unexpected cost growth. Cost estimates may also include the estimated cost of satisfying our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes in the form of either offset obligations or in-country industrial participation (ICIP) agreements, required under certain contracts primarily within our RIS and RMD segments. These obligations may or may not be distinct depending on their nature. Changes in estimates of net sales, cost of sales and the related impact to operating profit are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis, which recognizes the cumulative effect of the profit changes on current and prior periods based on a performance obligation’s percentage of completion in the current period. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of our performance obligations. Our EAC adjustments also include the establishment of loss provisions on our contracts accounted for on a percentage of completion basis. Net EAC adjustments had the following impact on our operating results: (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2021 2020 2019 Operating profit (loss) $ 110 $ (643) $ (69) Income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners (1) 87 (508) (55) Diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners (1) $ 0.06 $ (0.37) $ (0.06) (1) Amounts reflect a U.S. statutory tax rate of 21%, which approximates our tax rate on our EAC adjustments. As a result of the Raytheon Merger, Raytheon Company’s contracts accounted for on a percentage of completion basis were reset to zero percent complete as of the merger date, because only the unperformed portion of the contract at the merger date represented the obligation of the Company. For additional information related to the Raytheon Merger, see “Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Costs incurred for engineering and development of aerospace products under contracts with customers are capitalized as contract fulfillment costs, to the extent recoverable from the associated contract margin and customer funding, and subsequently amortized as the OEM products are delivered to the customer. The estimation of contract costs, and margin, considered as part of this recoverability assessment requires significant judgment. See “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion. We regularly assess capitalized contract fulfillment costs for impairment. In 2020, we recognized impairment of $111 million related to contract fulfillment costs. Income Taxes. Management believes that our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits, which may be realized over an extended period of time. For those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax carryforwards or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not likely, a valuation allowance is provided. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider available positive and negative evidence including past operating results, projections of future taxable income, the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards. Our projections of future taxable income include estimates and assumptions regarding our volume, pricing, and costs, as well as the timing and amount of reversals of taxable temporary differences. Valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be affected by changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future, we would reduce such amounts through an increase to tax expense in the period in which that determination is made or when tax law changes are enacted. Conversely, if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts, we would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a decrease to tax expense in the period in which that determination is made. In the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax positions. Significant judgment is required when assessing our income tax positions and in determining our tax expense and benefits. Each quarter, management 56 Table of Contents assesses our tax positions based on an evaluation of the facts, circumstances, applicable tax laws, including regulations, case law, and other interpretive guidance, as well as any other relevant information. Adjustments to our tax positions are made as new information becomes available or when our assessments change. In addition, we have entered into certain internal legal entity restructuring transactions necessary to effectuate the Separation Transactions. We have accrued tax on these transactions based on our interpretation of the applicable tax laws and our determination of appropriate entity valuations. See “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” and “Note 13: Income Taxes” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion. Management has determined that the distributions of Carrier and Otis on April 3, 2020, and certain related internal business separation transactions, qualified as tax-free under applicable law. In making these determinations, we applied the tax law in the relevant jurisdictions to our facts and circumstances and obtained tax rulings from the relevant taxing authorities, tax opinions, and/or other external tax advice related to the concluded tax treatment. If the completed distributions of Carrier or Otis, in each case, or certain internal business separation transactions, were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment, the Company could be subject to significant liabilities, and there could be material adverse impacts on the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity in future reporting periods. Goodwill and Intangible Assets. The assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Intangible assets acquired in business combinations consist of patents, trademarks/tradenames, developed technology, customer relationships, and other intangible assets. The fair value for acquired customer relationship intangibles is determined as of the acquisition date based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the future after-tax cash flows arising from the follow-on revenue from customer relationships that existed on the acquisition date over their estimated lives, including the probability of expected future contract renewals and revenue, less a contributory assets charge, all of which is discounted to present value. The fair value of the trademark and tradename intangible assets are determined utilizing the relief from royalty method which is a form of the income approach. Under this method, a royalty rate based on observed market royalties is applied to projected revenue supporting the tradename and discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. See “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further details. Also included within intangible assets are exclusivity assets, which are payments made to secure certain contractual rights to provide products on new commercial aerospace platforms. At December 31, 2021, our exclusivity assets, net of accumulated amortization, was approximately $2.4 billion, and our remaining estimated commitments, net of collaborator share, were approximately $8.9 billion. We regularly assess the recoverability of these intangibles, which is dependent upon our assumptions around the future success and profitability of the underlying aircraft platforms including the associated aftermarket revenue streams, and the related future cash flows. Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to impairment testing annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired. The impairment test compares carrying values of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets to their estimated fair values. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value then the carrying value is reduced to fair value. In developing our estimates for the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets, significant judgment is required in the determination of the appropriateness of using a qualitative assessment or quantitative assessment. For the quantitative assessments that are performed for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, fair value is primarily based on income approaches using a discounted cash flow method and relief from royalty method, respectively, which have significant assumptions including sales growth rates, projected operating profit, terminal growth rates, discount rates and royalty rates. Such assumptions are subject to variability from year to year and are directly impacted by, among other things, global market conditions. We completed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of October 1, 2021, where we compared the fair value of all of our reporting units to their respective carrying values (step 1) and determined that no adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill were necessary. We estimated the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow (DCF) model based on our most recent long-range plan in place at the time of our impairment testing. The key assumptions used in the DCF analysis include our business projections, including revenue growth rates and operating profit margins, the long-term growth rate used to calculate the terminal value of the reporting unit, and the discount rate. We consider both internal and external factors and refresh key assumptions annually or as considered necessary. As part of our 2021 analysis, we used a slightly higher long-term growth rate assumption as compared to our 2020 analysis, based on our review of historical growth rates for our business and industry, long-term inflation estimates, and industry reports on projected future long-term growth for the industry. Material changes in these estimates could occur and result in impairments in future periods. Based on our annual impairment analysis as of October 1, 2021, the reporting unit that was closest to impairment was a Collins Aerospace reporting unit with a fair value in excess of book value, including goodwill, of 15%. All other factors being equal, a 57 Table of Contents 10% decrease in expected future cash flows, either due to a delay in the return to pre-pandemic revenue levels or other factors, would result in an excess of fair value over net book value of approximately 3%. Alternatively, all other factors being equal, a 50 basis points decrease in the assumed long-term growth rate would result in an excess of fair value over net book value of approximately 7%. The discount rate that we used in our 2021 analysis was consistent with the discount rate used in our 2020 analysis. All other factors being equal, a 50 basis points increase in the discount rate would result in an excess of fair value over net book value of approximately 4%. All other reporting units had a fair value substantially in excess of book value. In 2020, we recognized goodwill impairments of $3.2 billion related to two Collins Aerospace reporting units. Refer to “Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional details. We also completed our annual indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment testing as of October 1, 2021. Based on this analysis, all of our indefinite-lived intangible assets had a fair value substantially in excess of book value. The Company continuously monitors and evaluates relevant events and circumstances that could unfavorably impact the key assumptions in determining the fair value of our reporting units, including long-term revenue growth projections, profitability and expectations for net cash flows, discount rates including changes to U.S. treasury rates and equity risk premiums, tax rates, recent market valuations from transactions by comparable companies, volatility in the Company’s market capitalization, and general industry, market and macro-economic conditions. It is possible that future changes in such circumstances, including significant future negative developments in the COVID-19 pandemic, or future changes in the inputs and assumptions used in estimating the fair value of our reporting units, including the expected long-term recovery of airline travel to pre-COVID-19 levels, would require the Company to record a non-cash impairment charge. Contingent Liabilities. As described in “Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K, contractual, regulatory and other matters in the normal course of business may arise that subject us to claims or litigation, including with respect to matters relating to technical issues on programs, government contracts, performance and operating cost guarantees, employee benefit plans, legal, and environmental, health and safety matter s. In particular, the design, development, production and support of aerospace technologies is inherently complex and subject to risk. Technical issues associated with these technologies may arise in the normal course and may result in financial impacts, including increased warranty provisions, customer contract settlements, and changes in contract performance e stimates. These impacts could be material to the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Additionally, we have significant contracts with the U.S. government, subject to government oversight and audit, which may require significant adjustment of contract prices. We accrue for liabilities associated with these matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Estimating our liability based on both the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes, and the costs associated with these matters, requires significant judgment. The inherent uncertainty related to the outcome of these matters could result in amounts materially different from any provisions made with respect to their resolution. Employee Benefit Plans . We sponsor domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and PRB plans. Assumptions used to calculate our funded status are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators. They are evaluated annually at December 31 and when significant events require a mid-year remeasurement. A change in any of these assumptions or actual experience that differs from these assumptions are subject to recognition in pension and postretirement net periodic benefit (income) expense reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans require judgement. Major assumptions include the discount rate and EROA. Other assumptions include mortality rates, demographic assumptions (such as retirement age), rate of increase in employee compensation levels, and health care cost increase projections. The weighted-average discount rates used to measure pension and PRB liabilities are based on yield curves developed using high-quality corporate bonds, which are subject to macroeconomic factors, as well as plan specific expected cash flows. For our significant plans, we utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit expense by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant discounted projected cash flows. The following table shows the sensitivity of our pension and PRB plan liabilities and net periodic benefit income to a 25 basis point change in the discount rates for benefit obligations, interest cost and service cost as of December 31, 2021: (dollars in millions) Increase in Discount Rate of 25 bps Decrease in Discount Rate of 25 bps Projected benefit obligation increase (decrease) $ (1,923) $ 2,023 Net periodic benefit income increase (decrease) (32) (9) 58 Table of Contents The discount rate sensitivities assume no change in the shape of the yield curve that will be applied to the projected cash outflows for future benefit payments in order to calculate interest and service cost. A flattening of the yield curve results in a narrowing of the spread between interest and obligation discount rates and would decrease our net periodic benefit income. Conversely, a steepening of the yield curve would result in an increase in the spread between interest and obligation discount rates and would increase our net periodic benefit income. The EROA is the average rate of earnings expected over the long term on assets invested to fund anticipated future benefit payment obligations. In determining the EROA assumption, we consider the target asset allocation of plan assets, as well as economic and other indicators of future performance. We may consult with and consider the opinions of financial and other professionals in determining the appropriate capital market assumptions. Return projections are validated using a simulation model that incorporates yield curves, credit spreads and risk premiums to project long-term prospective returns. Differences between actual asset returns in a given year and the EROA do not necessarily indicate a change in the assumption is required, as the EROA represents the expected average returns over a long-term horizon. Net periodic benefit income is also sensitive to changes in the EROA. An increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the EROA would have increased or decreased our 2021 net periodic benefit income by approximately $136 million. Refer to “Note 11: Employee Benefit Plans” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for discussion of current and prior year discount rate and EROA assumptions. ACCOUNTING STANDARDS For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see the Accounting Pronouncements section in “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Refer to “Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for discussion on contractual commitments and contingencies. GOVERNMENT MATTERS As described above in “Critical Accounting Estimates—Contingent Liabilities,” our contracts with the U.S. government are subject to audits. Such audits may recommend that certain contract prices should be reduced to comply with various government regulations, or that certain payments be delayed or withheld. We are also the subject of one or more investigations and legal proceedings initiated by the U.S. government with respect to government contract matters. See “Note 13: Income Taxes” and “Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of these and other government matters. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our primary market exposures are to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as it relates to our market risk sensitive instruments, which are primarily cash, debt and derivative instruments. To quantify our market risk exposure, we perform a sensitivity analysis based on hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Refer to “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles,” “Note 10: Borrowings and Lines of Credit” and “Note 15: Financial Instruments” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional discussion of foreign currency exchange, interest rates and financial instruments. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk. We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies and to various internal or external financing arrangements. We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business and financing. We actively manage foreign currency exposures that are associated with commi tted foreign currency purchases and sales, and other assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business at the operating unit level. More than insignificant exposures that cannot be naturally offset within an operating unit are hedged with foreign currency derivatives. Foreign exchange exposures arising from intercompany loan and deposit transactions are also hedged regularly. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency hedges was $8.5 billion and $11.6 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively . Foreign currency forward contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. A 10% unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have resulted in an increase in unrealized losses of $0.6 billion and $0.8 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Such losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. We believe these foreign currency forward exchange contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments, when taken together, do not create material market risk. 59 Table of Contents Within our aerospace business, our sales are typically denominated in U.S. Dollars. However, for our non-U.S. based entities, such as Pratt & Whitney Canada (P&WC), a substantial portion of their costs are incurred in local currencies. Consequently, there is a foreign currency exchange impact and risk to operational results as U.S. Dollars must be converted to local currencies such as the Canadian Dollar in order to meet local currency cost obligations. Additionally, we transact business in various foreign currencies which exposes our cash flows and earnings to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to minimize the exposure that exists from changes in the exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar against these other currencies, we hedge a certain portion of sales to secure the rates at which U.S. Dollars will be converted. The majority of this hedging activity occurs at P&WC and Collins Aerospace, and hedging activity also occurs to a lesser extent at the remainder of Pratt & Whitney. At P&WC and Collins Aerospace, firm and forecasted sales for both original equipment and spare parts are hedged at varying amounts for up to 49 months on the U.S. Dollar sales exposure as represented by the excess of U.S. Dollar sales over U.S. Dollar denominated purchases. Hedging gains and losses resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are partially offset by the foreign currency translation impacts that are generated on the translation of local currency operating results into U.S. Dollars for reporting purposes. While the objective of the hedging program is to minimize the foreign currency exchange impact on operating results, there are typically variances between the hedging gains or losses and the translational impact due to the length of hedging contracts, changes in the sales profile, volatility in the exchange rates and other such operational considerations. Interest Rate Risk. We have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally fixed-rate debt obligations. A 100 basis points unfavorable interest rate movement would have had an approximate $4 billion i mpact on the fair value of our fixed-rate debt at both December 31, 2021 and 2020. The investors in our fixed-rate debt obligations generally do not have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, we believe our exposure to interest rate risk on our fixed-rate debt is not material. From time to time, we may hedge to floating rates using interest rate swaps. Currently, we do not hold any derivative contracts that hedge our interest exposures, but may consider such strategies in the future. 60 Table of Contents ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The management of RTC is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Management has assessed the effectiveness of RTC’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in its Internal Control—Integrated Framework , released in 2013 . Management concluded that based on its assessment, RTC’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021. The effectiveness of RTC’s internal control over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2021, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein. /s/ GREGORY J. HAYES Gregory J. Hayes President and Chief Executive Officer /s/ NEIL G. MITCHILL, JR. Neil G. Mitchill, Jr. Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer /s/ AMY L. JOHNSON Amy L. Johnson Corporate Vice President and Controller 61 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareowners and Board of Directors of Raytheon Technologies Corporation Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Raytheon Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income (loss), of changes in equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Basis for Opinions The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 62 Table of Contents Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Revenue Recognition - Contract Estimates at Completion As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, a significant portion of the Company’s revenues of $64.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021 are from long-term contracts associated with the design, development, manufacture or modification of complex aerospace or defense equipment or related services. The timing of the satisfaction of performance obligations varies across the Company’s businesses due to their diverse product and service mix, customer base, and contractual terms. Substantially all of the Company’s revenues from the Raytheon Intelligence & Space and Raytheon Missiles & Defense segments are recognized over time because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer. The Company’s revenues from certain long-term aftermarket contracts within its Pratt & Whitney segment are recognized over the contract period as a series of daily performance obligations to stand ready to provide spare parts, product maintenance and aftermarket services. For the performance obligations satisfied over time, revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of the Company’s performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment by management on a contract by contract basis. Within the Raytheon Intelligence & Space and Raytheon Missiles & Defense segments, the variables and significant judgments relate to key contract matters, progress towards completion and the related program schedule, identified risks and opportunities and the related changes in estimates of revenues and costs. The risks and opportunities for the contracts relate to management’s ability and cost to achieve the schedule, consideration of customer-directed delays or reductions in scheduled deliveries, technical requirements, customer activity levels and related variable consideration. Management also makes judgments about variables related to estimates of labor productivity and availability, the complexity and scope of the work to be performed, the availability and cost of materials, the length of time to complete the performance obligation, execution by the Company’s subcontractors, the availability and timing of funding from the customer, overhead cost rates, and the estimated cost of satisfying the Company’s industrial cooperation agreements required under certain contracts. Within the Pratt & Whitney segment, the variables and significant judgments relate to current and past maintenance cost and frequency experience. Management reviews contract estimates at completion on a periodic basis and no less than annually or when a change in circumstances warrants a modification to a previous estimate. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition - contract estimates at completion is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in developing their estimates of total revenue and total costs at completion, including significant judgments and assumptions on a contract by contract basis, and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating audit evidence related to management’s estimates of total revenue and total cost at completion for contracts. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls over the estimates of total revenue and total costs at completion. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the estimated total revenue and total costs at completion, including evaluating on a test basis the reasonableness of certain significant judgments and variables considered by management specific to each contract or performance obligation. Evaluating the significant judgments and assumptions related to the estimates of total revenue and total costs at completion involved evaluating whether the significant judgments and assumptions used were reasonable considering: (i) management’s historical forecasting accuracy, (ii) evidence to support the relevant aforementioned variables, (iii) the consistent application of accounting policies, and (iv) the timely identification of circumstances which may warrant a modification to a previous estimate. 63 Table of Contents Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets Impairment Assessments As described in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset balances were $54.4 billion and $8.7 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2021. A portion of the total goodwill balance relates to goodwill associated with certain reporting units in the Collins Aerospace Systems, Raytheon Missiles & Defense, and Raytheon Intelligence & Space segments. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment testing annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired. For the quantitative assessments that are performed for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, fair value is primarily based on income approaches using a discounted cash flow method and relief from royalty method, respectively, which have significant assumptions related to sales growth rates, projected operating profit, terminal growth rates, discount rates, and royalty rates. The impairment testing compares carrying values to estimated fair values. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, then the carrying value is reduced to fair value. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment assessments is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value of certain reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to sales growth rates, terminal growth rates, and discount rates, as applicable, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment assessments, including controls over the valuation of certain reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimates, (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow and relief from royalty methods, (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the estimates, and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to sales growth rates, terminal growth rates, and discount rates, as applicable. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to sales growth rates and terminal growth rates involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the relevant businesses (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the Company’s discounted cash flow and relief from royalty methods, and the terminal growth rates and discount rates assumptions. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Boston, Massachusetts February 11, 2022 We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1947. 64 Table of Contents RAYTHEON TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS (dollars in millions, except per share amounts;

Actual results could differ from those estimates. Separation Transactions, Distributions and Raytheon Merger. On April 3, 2020, United Technologies Corporation (UTC) (since renamed Raytheon Technologies Corporation) completed the separation of its business into three independent, publicly traded companies – UTC, Carrier Global Corporation (Carrier) and Otis Worldwide Corporation (Otis) (the Separation Transactions). UTC distributed all of the outstanding shares of Carrier common stock and all of the outstanding shares of Otis common stock to UTC shareowners who held shares of UTC common stock as of the close of business on March 19, 2020 (the Distributions). Immediately following the Separation Transactions and the Distributions, on April 3, 2020, UTC and Raytheon Company completed their all-stock merger of equals transaction (the Raytheon Merger), pursuant to which Raytheon Company became a wholly owned subsidiary of UTC, and UTC was renamed “Raytheon Technologies Corporation.” The historical results of Carrier and Otis are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Unless otherwise indicated, amounts and activity throughout these Consolidated Financial Statements are presented on a continuing operations basis. Refer to “Note 3: Discontinued Operations” below for further details. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “we,” “our,” “us,” “the Company,” “Raytheon Technologies,” and “RTC” mean United Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries when referring to periods prior to the Raytheon Merger and to the combined company, Raytheon Technologies Corporation, when referring to periods after the Raytheon Merger. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “Raytheon Company,” or “Raytheon” mean Raytheon Company and its subsidiaries prior to the Raytheon Merger. UTC was determined to be the accounting acquirer in the Raytheon Merger and, as a result, the financial statements of Raytheon Technologies as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 include Raytheon Company’s financial position and results of operations for the period subsequent to the completion of the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to negatively affect the global economy, our business and operations, supply chains, and the industries in which we operate. As a result of COVID-19, commercial air travel demand experienced an unprecedented downturn as governments, businesses and individuals reacted to the pandemic in ways such as lockdowns, quarantines, border closings and other travel restrictions and requirements, the adoption of remote working and decreased leisure travel. The unprecedented decrease in air travel adversely affected our airline and airframer customers and their demand for our products and services of our Collins Aerospace Systems (Collins Aerospace) and Pratt & Whitney businesses. In addition, the border closings, lockdowns and labor shortages resulting from COVID-19 negatively impacted global supply and distribution capabilities. Decreases in the availability, cost and delivery of supplies have caused shortages and delays for the procurement of raw materials, components and other supplies required for our performance. As a result of all of these factors, we expect our future operating results, particularly those of our Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney businesses, to continue to be negatively impacted when compared to pre-COVID-19 (2019) results. Our Raytheon Intelligence & Space (RIS) and Raytheon Missiles & Defense (RMD) businesses, although experiencing some negative impacts, primarily from supply chain pressures and labor shortages, have not experienced significant business disruptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, we recorded write-downs of assets and significant unfavorable Estimate at Completion (EAC) adjustments in our Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney businesses primarily related to: • Goodwill impairment charges of $ 3.2 billion related to two of our Collins Aerospace reporting units. Refer to “Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets” for additional information; • increased estimated credit losses on both our receivables and contract assets of $ 387 million; • an unfavorable EAC adjustment on a Pratt & Whitney commercial engine aftermarket contract due to lower estimated revenues driven by a change in the estimated maintenance coverage period of $ 334 million; • contract asset and inventory impairments at Collins Aerospace due to the impact of lower estimated future customer activity resulting from the expected acceleration of fleet retirements of a certain commercial aircraft type of $ 146 million; • an unfavorable EAC adjustment of $ 129 million related to lower estimated revenues due to the restructuring of a customer contract at Pratt & Whitney; • an $ 89 million impairment of commercial aircraft program assets at Pratt & Whitney; • the impairment of a Collins Aerospace trade name of $ 57 million; 70 Table of Contents • net unfavorable EAC adjustments on commercial aftermarket contracts at Pratt & Whitney based on a change in estimated future customer activity of $ 75 million; • an unfavorable EAC adjustment at Pratt & Whitney related to a shift in overhead costs to military contracts of $ 44 million; and • reserves related to a commercial financing arrangement at Pratt & Whitney of $ 43 million. While we believe that the long-term outlook for the aerospace industry remains positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel demand, there continues to be uncertainty with respect to the point at which commercial air traffic capacity will return to and/or exceed pre-COVID-19 levels. We have seen indications that commercial air travel is recovering in certain areas of demand; however, other areas continue to lag. In addition, while global vaccination rates have increased, infection from COVID-19 variants have continued, which may impact the pace of the commercial aerospace recovery. Further, the commercial air travel recovery is tied to general economic conditions and may be impacted by inflation or government budget deficits, among other factors. However, we continue to estimate that a full recovery may occur in 2023 or 2024. As our commercial aerospace business recovers, we have seen increases in certain employee-related and discretionary costs, which had decreased in the aftermath of COVID-19 due to one-time cost reduction actions in 2020. A recovery may also impact our judgments around credit risk related to estimated credit losses. On September 24, 2021, in furtherance of an executive order, the U.S. Safer Federal Workforce Task Force issued guidance requiring federal contractors and subcontractors to comply with COVID-19 safety protocols, including requiring certain employees to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 except in limited circumstances. The implementation of this mandate may result in attrition, including attrition of critically skilled labor and difficulty in securing future labor needs, for our workforce, as well as the workforces of our subcontractors, suppliers and customers. The mandate is currently subject to various legal proceedings. As a result, the impact of mandate on our operations and performance, as well as on our subcontractors, suppliers and customers, is uncertain. However, if ultimately required, the mandate could affect our performance on contracts, particularly due to disruptions in subcontractor or supplier performance or deliveries, and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our expectations regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing recovery and their potential financial impact are based on available information and assumptions that we believe are reasonable at this time; however, the actual financial impact is highly uncertain and subject to a wide range of factors and future developments. New information may continue to emerge concerning the scope, severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as any worsening of the pandemic, the effect of additional variants, the efficacy, acceptance, distribution and availability of vaccines, new or continued actions to contain the pandemic’s spread or treat its impact, and governmental, business and individual actions taken in response to the pandemic (including restrictions and limitations on travel and transportation, and changes in leisure and business travel patterns and work environments) among others. Some of these actions and related impacts may be trends that continue in the future even after the pandemic no longer poses a significant public health risk. Summary of Accounting Principles. The following represents the significant accounting principles of Raytheon Technologies Corporation. Consolidation and Classification. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Raytheon Technologies Corporation, and all wholly owned, majority-owned and otherwise controlled domestic and foreign subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. For our consolidated non-wholly owned subsidiaries, a noncontrolling interest is recognized to reflect the portion of equity that is not attributable to us. For classification of certain current assets and liabilities, the duration of our contracts or programs is utilized to define our operating cycle, which is generally longer than one year. Included within our Current assets and liabilities are Contract assets and liabilities related to our aftermarket and development arrangements, which can generally span up to fifteen years. We reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to our current period presentation. These reclassifications include the reclassification of assets and liabilities related to discontinued operations to Other assets, current and Other accrued liabilities, respectively, and the reclassification of debt extinguishment costs, which were previously included in Interest expense, net. Use of Estimates. Our Consolidated Financial statements are based on the application of U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial statements and the accompanying notes. As discussed above, the full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity, including sales, expenses, reserves and allowances, asset recoverability and EAC adjustments, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19 and related containment and treatment actions, as well as the economic impact on local, regional, national and international customers and markets. We have made estimates of the impact of COVID-19 within our financial statements and there may be changes to those estimates in future periods. Other future events, including COVID-19, and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. Therefore, the 71 Table of Contents determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and any such differences may be material to our Consolidated Financial statements. Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term cash investments that are highly liquid in nature and have original maturities of three months or less. The estimated fair value of Cash and cash equivalents approximates the carrying value due to their short maturities. Accounts Receivable. Accounts receivable are stated at the net amount expected to be collected. We are exposed to credit losses primarily on our accounts receivable and contract assets related to our sales of products and services to commercial customers. The allowance for expected credit losses is established to provide for the expected lifetime credit losses by evaluating factors such as customer creditworthiness, historical payment and loss experiences, current economic conditions, including geographic and political risk, and the age and status of outstanding receivables. In certain circumstances, we may be able to develop reasonable and supportable forecasts over the contractual term of the financial asset. For periods beyond which we are able to make or obtain reasonable and supportable forecasts, we revert to historical loss experience and information. We determine credit ratings for each customer in our portfolio based upon public information and information obtained directly from our customers. We conduct a review of customer credit ratings, published historical credit default rates for different rating categories, and multiple third-party aircraft value publications as a basis to validate the reasonableness of the allowance for expected credit losses on a quarterly basis, or when events and circumstances warrant. A credit limit is established for each customer based on the outcome of this review and consideration of the other factors discussed above. In certain cases, we may require collateral or prepayment to mitigate credit risk. Expected credit losses are written off in the period in which the financial asset is no longer collectible. Unbilled receivables represent revenues that are not currently billable to the customer under the terms of the contract and include unbilled amounts under commercial contracts where payment is solely subject to the passage of time. These items are expected to be billed and collected in the normal course of business. Accounts receivable as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 includes unbilled receivables of $ 342 million and $ 228 million, respectively, which primarily includes unbilled receivables with commercial aerospace customers. Other unbilled receivables where payment is subject to factors beyond just the passage of time are included in Contract assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and are generally classified as current. Contract Assets and Liabilities. Contract assets and liabilities represent the difference in the timing of revenue recognition from receipt of cash from our customers. Contract assets reflect revenue recognized and performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in advance of customer billing. Contract liabilities relate to payments received in advance of the satisfaction of performance under the contract. We receive payments from customers based on the terms established in our contracts. Contract assets and Contract liabilities are generally classified as current as our operating cycle is generally longer than one year. See “Note 6: Contract Assets and Liabilities” for further discussion of Contract assets and liabilities. As described in more detail above in “Accounts Receivable,” we are exposed to credit losses on our contract assets related to our sales of products and services to commercial customers and regularly assess our allowance for expected credit losses as it relates to our Contract assets. Inventory. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value and is primarily based on first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost methods. Valuation reserves for excess, obsolete, and slow-moving inventory are estimated by comparing the inventory levels of individual parts to both future sales forecasts or production requirements and historical usage rates in order to identify inventory where the resale value or replacement value is less than inventoriable cost. Other factors that management considers in determining the adequacy of these reserves include whether individual inventory parts meet current specifications and can be substituted for a part currently being sold or used as a service part, overall market conditions, and other inventory management initiatives. Manufacturing costs are allocated to current production contracts. In our commercial aerospace businesses, excess costs beyond standard manufacturing costs are expensed when they meet certain thresholds. Equity Method Investments. Investments in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but do not control, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Under this method of accounting, our share of the net earnings or losses of the investee is included in Other income, net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations since the activities of the investee are closely aligned with the operations of the business segment holding the investment. We evaluate our equity method investments whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amounts of such investments may be impaired. If a decline in the value of an equity method investment is determined to be other than temporary, a loss is recorded in earnings in the current period. Our sales to and 72 Table of Contents purchases from unconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method, which are considered related parties, are not material. Customer Financing Assets . Customer financing assets (CFA) relate to our commercial aerospace businesses in which we provide financing to airline customers. Our financing predominately relates to products under lease, and to a lesser extent, notes and lease receivables. In certain limited circumstances, we pay deposits on behalf of our airline customers to secure production slots with the airframers, and such pre-delivery payments are included in our notes receivables. Any unfunded pre-delivery payments are included within our commercial aerospace financing commitments as further discussed in “Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies.” Interest income from notes and financing leases and rental income from operating lease assets is generally included in Other income, net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations, while gains or losses on sales of operating lease assets are included in products sales and cost of sales. The current portion of these financing arrangements are aggregated in Accounts receivable, net and the non-current portion of these financing arrangements are aggregated in CFA in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The increases and decreases in CFA from funding, receipts and certain other activity, are generally reflected as Investing Activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Leased assets are valued at cost and reviewed for impairment when circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Notes and lease receivables are valued at the net amount expected to be collected. For notes and lease receivables, we determine a specific reserve for exposure based on the difference between the carrying value of the receivable and the estimated fair value of the related collateral in connection with the evaluation of credit risk and collectability. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the reserves related to CFA were not material. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, we did not have any significant balances that are considered to be delinquent, on non-accrual status, past due 90 days or more, or considered to be impaired. Business Combinations. Once a business is acquired, the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is determined with the excess cost recorded to goodwill. As required, a preliminary fair value is determined once a business is acquired, with the final determination of the fair value being completed no later than one year from the date of acquisition. In connection with the acquisitions of Rockwell Collins in 2018 and Goodrich in 2012, and to a lesser extent the acquisition of Raytheon Company in 2020, we recorded assumed liabilities related to customer contractual obligations on certain contracts with economic returns that were lower than what could be realized in market transactions as of the acquisition date. We measured these assumed liabilities based on the estimated cash flows of the programs plus a reasonable contracting profit margin required to transfer the contracts to market participants. These liabilities are being amortized in accordance with the underlying pattern of obligations, as reflected by the expenses incurred on the contracts. The balance of the contractual obligations was $ 929 million and $ 1,243 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Total consumption of the contractual obligations for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $ 314 million, $ 295 million and $ 345 million, respectively, with future consumption expected to be as follows: $ 113 million in 2022, $ 95 million in 2023, $ 83 million in 2024, $ 78 million in 2025, $ 71 million in 2026 and $ 489 million thereafter. Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to impairment testing annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired. The goodwill impairment test compares carrying values of the reporting units to their estimated fair values. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value then the carrying value is reduced to fair value. In developing our estimates for the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets, significant judgment is required in the determination of the appropriateness of using a qualitative assessment or quantitative assessment. For the quantitative assessments that are performed, fair value is primarily based on income approaches using a discounted cash flow method or relief from royalty method, which have significant assumptions including sales growth rates, projected operating profit, terminal growth rates, discount rates and royalty rates. Such assumptions are subject to variability from year to year and are directly impacted by, among other things, global market conditions. Finite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment when events occur that indicate that the net book value will not be recovered over future cash flows. Intangible assets consist of patents, trademarks/tradenames, customer relationships, exclusivity assets, developed technology and other intangible assets including collaboration assets. Acquired intangible assets are recognized at fair value in purchase accounting. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized to Cost of sales and Selling, general and administrative expenses over the applicable useful lives. Exclusivity assets are commercial aerospace payments made to secure certain contractual rights to provide product on new aircraft platforms. We classify amortization of such payments as a reduction of sales. Such payments are capitalized when there are distinct rights obtained and there are sufficient incremental cash flows to support the recoverability of the assets established. Otherwise, the applicable portion of the payments are expensed. In addition, in connection with our 2012 agreement to acquire Rolls-Royce’s ownership and collaboration interests in International Aero Engines AG (IAE), additional payments are due to Rolls-Royce contingent upon each hour flown through June 2027 by the V2500-powered aircraft in service as of the acquisition date. These flight hour payments are being capitalized as collaboration assets and amortized to cost of sales. 73 Table of Contents Useful lives of finite-lived intangible assets are estimated based upon the nature of the intangible asset and the industry in which the intangible asset is used. These intangible assets are amortized based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed, as represented by the underlying cash flows, which may result in an amortization method other than straight-line. For both our commercial aerospace collaboration assets and exclusivity arrangements, the pattern of economic benefit generally results in no amortization during the development period with amortization beginning as programs enter full rate production and aftermarket cycles. If a pattern of economic benefit cannot be reliably determined or if straight-line amortization approximates the pattern of economic benefit, a straight-line amortization method may be used. The range of estimated useful lives is as follows: Years Collaboration assets 30 Customer relationships and related programs 2 to 32 Developed technology 3 to 25 Patents and trademarks 3 to 30 Exclusivity assets 5 to 25 Leases. As a lessee, we record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases are classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. We enter into lease agreements for the use of real estate space, vehicles, information technology equipment, and certain other equipment under both operating and finance leases. We determine if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in Operating lease right-of-use assets and Operating lease liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The current portion of our operating lease liabilities is included in Accrued liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Finance leases are not considered significant to our Consolidated Balance Sheet or Consolidated Statement of Operations. Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments, and use the implicit rate when readily determinable. We determine our incremental borrowing rate through market sources including relevant industry rates. Our lease right-of-use assets also include any initial direct costs and lease pre-payments made at or before the commencement date and are reduced for any lease incentives received at or before the commencement date. Certain of our leases include variable payments, which may vary based upon changes in facts or circumstances after the start of the lease. We exclude variable payments from lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, to the extent such payments are not considered fixed, and instead, expense variable payments as incurred. Variable lease expense and lease expense for short duration contracts are not a material component of lease expense. Some of our leases include the option to extend or terminate the lease. We include these options in the recognition of our right-of-use assets and lease liabilities when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option. Lease expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In limited instances we act as a lessor, primarily for commercial aerospace engines, the majority of which are classified as operating leases. These leases are not significant to our Consolidated Balance Sheet or Consolidated Statement of Operations. Other Long-Lived Assets. We evaluate the potential impairment of other long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of other long-lived assets held and used exceeds the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows, the carrying value is written down to fair value. In order for long-lived assets to be considered held for disposal, we must have committed to a plan to dispose of the assets. Once deemed held for disposal, the assets are stated at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value. Income Taxes. Future income taxes represent the tax effects of transactions which are reported in different periods for tax and financial reporting purposes. These amounts consist of the tax effects of temporary differences between the tax and financial reporting balance sheets and tax carryforwards. Future income tax benefits and payables within the same tax paying component of a particular jurisdiction are offset for presentation in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. I n the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax positions. We assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more-likely-than-not 74 Table of Contents that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. Where applicable, associated interest expense has also been recognized. We recognize accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense. Penalties, if incurred, would be recognized as a component of income tax expense. State income tax amounts are generally included in income tax expense; however state income tax payments related to our Raytheon Intelligence & Space (RIS) and Raytheon Missiles & Defense (RMD) segments are generally recoverable through the pricing of products and services to the U.S. government. Accordingly, these state income taxes are generally allocated to contracts and then classified as Selling, general and administrative expenses when paid (recovered) or otherwise agreed as allocable with the U.S. government. We have elected to account for tax on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income ( GILTI) as a period cost, as incurred. Revenue Recognition. The vast majority of our revenues are from long-term contracts associated with the design, development, manufacture or modification of complex aerospace or defense equipment or related services. Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney primarily serve commercial and government customers in both the OEM and aftermarket parts and services markets of the aerospace industry, while RIS and RMD primarily provide products and services to government customers in the defense industry. We account for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. For certain contracts that meet the foregoing requirements, primarily contracts that are directly with a foreign government, we are required to obtain certain regulatory approvals. In these cases, we recognize revenue based on the likelihood of obtaining regulatory approvals based upon all known facts and circumstances. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. Some of our contracts with customers contain a single performance obligation, while others contain multiple performance obligations most commonly when a contract contains multiple distinct units (such as engines or certain aerospace components) or spans multiple phases of the product life-cycle such as production, maintenance and support. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as the performance obligation is satisfied. When there are multiple performance obligations within a contract, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on its standalone selling price when available. If standalone selling price is not available, we estimate the standalone selling price of each performance obligation, which is generally based on an expected cost plus a margin approach. We consider the contractual consideration payable by the customer and assess variable consideration that may affect the total transaction price, including contractual discounts, contract incentive payments, estimates of award fees, flight hours, aircraft landings or other customer usage activities on long term maintenance contracts, and other sources of variable consideration, when determining the transaction price of each contract. When reasonably able to estimate, we include variable consideration in the transaction price at the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled. We include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. These estimates are based on historical experience, anticipated performance and our best judgment at the time. We also consider whether our contracts contain a significant financing component, which they generally do not. Timing of the satisfaction of performance obligations varies across our businesses due to our diverse product and service mix, customer base, and contractual terms. Performance obligations are satisfied as of a point in time for certain aerospace components, engines, and spare parts. Revenue is recognized when control of the product transfers to the customer, generally upon product shipment. Since billing also typically occurs upon product shipment, we generally do not have Contract assets or Contract liabilities balances related to point in time sales. Performance obligations are satisfied over-time if the customer receives the benefits as we perform work, if the customer controls the asset as it is being produced (continuous transfer of control), or if the product being produced for the customer has no alternative use and we have a contractual right to payment for performance to date. We recognize revenue on an over-time basis for substantially all defense contracts and certain long-term aerospace OEM and aftermarket contracts. Substantially all of our defense business revenue, which primarily relates to our RIS and RMD segments, and to a lesser extent Pratt & Whitney and Collins Aerospace, is recognized over time because of the continuous transfer of control to our customers. For performance obligations satisfied over time, revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis generally using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress. Incurred costs represent work performed, which correspond with and best depict transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs can include labor, materials, subcontractors’ costs, or other direct costs and indirect costs. Our contracts with the U.S. government are typically subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and are priced based on estimated or actual costs of producing goods or 75 Table of Contents providing services. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services provided under U.S. government contracts. The pricing for non-U.S. government contracts is based on the specific negotiations with each customer. Under the typical payment terms of our U.S. government fixed-price contracts, the customer pays us either performance-based payments (PBPs) or progress payments. PBPs are interim payments equal to a negotiated percentage of the contract price based on quantifiable measures of performance or on the achievement of specified events or milestones. Progress payments are interim payments up to 80-90% of costs incurred as the work progresses. Because the customer retains a portion of the contract price until completion of the contract, our U.S. government fixed-price contracts generally result in revenue recognized in excess of billings which we present as Contract assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For our U.S. government cost-type contracts, the customer generally pays us for our costs incurred within a short period of time. For non-U.S. government contracts, we typically receive interim payments as work progresses, although for some contracts, we may be entitled to receive an advance payment. Such advances are not considered a significant financing component because they are used to meet working capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract and to protect us from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract. We recognize a liability for advance payments in excess of revenue recognized and present it as Contract liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For certain of our long-term aftermarket contracts, revenue is recognized over the contract period. We generally account for such contracts as a series of daily performance obligations to stand ready to provide spare parts, product maintenance and aftermarket services. These arrangements include the sale of spare parts with integral services to our customers, and are generally classified as Services sales, with the corresponding costs classified in Cost of sales - services, within the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Revenue is primarily recognized on a percentage of completion basis using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress, as sufficient historical evidence indicates that the cost of performing services under the contract is incurred on an other-than-straight-line basis. For some of our long-term aftermarket contracts, we receive payment prior to delivery of products and services, resulting in a contract liability balance, while for others, we deliver products or services in advance of payment, resulting in a contract asset balance. Contracts are often modified to account for changes in contract specifications or requirements. We consider contract modifications to exist when the modification either creates new or changes existing enforceable rights and obligations. Contract modifications for goods or services that are not distinct are accounted for as part of the existing contract either on a cumulative catch-up basis or prospective basis depending on the nature of the modification. Loss provisions on contracts are recognized to the extent that estimated contract costs exceed the estimated consideration from the products or services contemplated under the contractual arrangement. For new commitments, we generally record loss provisions at contract signing except for certain contracts under which losses are recorded upon receipt of the purchase order that obligates us to perform. For existing commitments, anticipated losses on contractual arrangements are recognized in the period in which losses become evident. In estimating losses, products contemplated under contractual arrangements include firm quantities of product sold under contract and, in the commercial engine and wheels and brakes businesses, future highly probable sales of replacement parts required by regulation that are expected to be sold subsequently for incorporation into the original equipment. In our commercial engine and wheels and brakes businesses, when the OEM product is sold for a loss, but the combined OEM and aftermarket arrangement for each individual sales campaign is profitable, we record OEM product losses at the time of product delivery. We review our Estimate at Completion (EACs) on significant contracts on a periodic basis and for others, no less than annually or when a change in circumstances warrant a modification to a previous estimate. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of the Company’s performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment by management on a contract by contract basis. As part of this process, management reviews information including, but not limited to, any outstanding key contract matters, progress towards completion and the related program schedule, identified risks and opportunities and the related changes in estimates of revenues and costs. The risks and opportunities relate to management’s judgment about the ability and cost to achieve the schedule, consideration of customer-directed delays or reductions in scheduled deliveries, technical requirements, customer activity levels, such as flight hours or aircraft landings, and related variable consideration. Management’s judgment related to these considerations has become increasingly more significant given the economic environment primarily caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Management must make assumptions and estimates regarding contract revenue and costs, including estimates of labor productivity and availability, the complexity and scope of the work to be performed, the availability and cost of materials, the length of time to complete the performance obligation, execution by our subcontractors, the availability and timing of funding from our customer, overhead cost rates, and current and past maintenance cost and frequency driven by estimated aircraft and engine utilization and estimated useful lives of components, among others. Cost estimates may also include the estimated cost of satisfying our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes in the form of either offset obligations or in-country industrial participation (ICIP) agreements, required under certain contracts primarily within our RIS and RMD 76 Table of Contents segments. These obligations may or may not be distinct depending on their nature. If cash is paid to a customer to satisfy our offset obligations it is recorded as a reduction in the transaction price. Changes in estimates of net sales, cost of sales and the related impact to operating profit on contracts recognized over time are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis, which recognizes the cumulative effect of the profit changes on current and prior periods based on a performance obligation’s percentage of completion in the current period. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of our performance obligations. Our EAC adjustments also include the establishment of loss provisions for our contracts accounted for on a percentage of completion basis. Net EAC adjustments had the following impact on our operating results: (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2021 2020 2019 Total Net Sales $ 296 $ ( 407 ) $ ( 106 ) Operating profit (loss) 110 ( 643 ) ( 69 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners (1) 87 ( 508 ) ( 55 ) Diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners (1) $ 0.06 $ ( 0.37 ) $ ( 0.06 ) (1) Amounts reflect a U.S. statutory tax rate of 21%, which approximates our tax rate on our EAC adjustments. For additional discussion on significant unfavorable EAC adjustments in 2020, see the COVID-19 Pandemic discussion above. As a result of the Raytheon Merger, Raytheon Company’s contracts accounted for on a percentage of completion basis were reset to zero percent complete as of the date of completion of the Raytheon Merger, because only the unperformed portion of the contract at such date represents an obligation of the Company. This had the impact of reducing EAC adjustments for these segments in the short term, most notably in 2020. For additional information related to the Raytheon Merger, see “Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets.” In our Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney businesses, we may offer customers incentives to purchase our products, which may result in payments made to those customers, which are treated as a reduction in sales. In our Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney businesses, we incur contract fulfillment costs for engineering and development of aerospace OEM products directly related to existing or anticipated contracts with customers. Such costs generate or enhance our ability to satisfy our performance obligations under these contracts. We capitalize these costs as contract fulfillment costs to the extent the costs are recoverable from the associated contract margin and customer funding, and subsequently amortize the costs as the related performance obligations are satisfied. In instances where intellectual property does not transfer to the customer, we generally defer the customer funding of product engineering and development and recognize revenue when the related performance obligations are satisfied. Capitalized contract fulfillment costs were $ 1,974 million and $ 1,981 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are classified in Other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheet and are included in Other operating activities, net in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. We regularly assess capitalized contract fulfillment costs for impairment and recognized $ 111 million of impairment for contract fulfillment costs in 2020. Costs to obtain contracts are not material. In view of the risks and costs associated with developing new engines and the large up-front investments required that often require returns generated over the full estimated life of the engine, Pratt & Whitney has entered into certain collaboration arrangements in which sales, costs and risks are shared. Sales generated from engine programs, spare parts sales, and aftermarket business under these collaboration arrangements are recorded consistent with our revenue recognition policies in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Amounts attributable to our collaborators for their share of sales are recorded as cost of sales in our Consolidated Financial Statements based upon the terms and nature of the arrangement. Costs associated with engine programs under collaborative arrangements are expensed as incurred. Under these arrangements, collaborators contribute their program share of engine parts, incur their own production costs and make certain payments for shared or joint program costs. The reimbursement from collaborators of their share of program costs is recorded as a reduction of the related expense item at that time. As of December 31, 2021, the collaborators’ interests in all commercial engine programs ranged from 13 % to 49 %, inclusive of a portion of Pratt & Whitney’s interests held by other participants. Pratt & Whitney is the principal participant in all existing collaborative arrangements, with the exception of the Engine Alliance (EA), a joint venture with GE Aviation, which markets and manufactures the GP7000 engine for the Airbus A380 aircraft. There are no individually significant collaborative arrangements, and none of the collaborators individually have more than a 25 % share in an individual 77 Table of Contents program. The following table illustrates the Consolidated Statement of Operations classification and amounts attributable to transactions arising from the collaborative arrangements between participants for each period presented. (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Collaborator share of sales: Cost of sales - products $ 1,534 $ 1,183 $ 2,097 Cost of sales - services 1,428 1,374 1,674 Collaborator share of program costs (reimbursement of expenses incurred): Cost of sales - products ( 160 ) ( 147 ) ( 190 ) Research and development ( 135 ) ( 177 ) ( 219 ) Selling, general and administrative ( 85 ) ( 99 ) ( 101 ) Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO). RPO represents the aggregate amount of total contract transaction price that is unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied. Total RPO was $ 156 billion as of December 31, 2021. Of the total RPO as of December 31, 2021, we expect approximately 30 % will be recognized as sales over the next 12 months. This percentage of RPO to be recognized as sales over the next 12 months depends on our current estimates of future developments, which are highly uncertain, and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the scope, severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, actions to contain its spread or treat its impact, and governmental, business and individuals’ actions taken in response to the pandemic, which may result in customer delays or order cancellations. Approximately 40 % of our RPO relates to long-term commercial aerospace maintenance contracts at Pratt & Whitney, which are generally expected to be realized over a span of up to 15 years. Research and Development. Company-sponsored research and development costs, including those costs related to the Company’s portion in connection with cost-sharing arrangements, are charged to expense as incurred and recovery on these cost-sharing arrangements is recorded as a reduction to research and development expense as earned. Customer-sponsored research and development projects performed under contracts with customers are accounted for as contract costs and reported as cost of sales on the related revenue generating contracts. Foreign Exchange. We conduct business in many different currencies and, accordingly, are subject to the inherent risks associated with foreign exchange rate movements. The financial position and results of operations of many of our foreign subsidiaries are often measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at the exchange rates existing at the respective balance sheet dates, and income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates during the respective periods. The aggregate effects of translating the balance sheets of these subsidiaries are deferred as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL) in shareowners’ equity. Foreign exchange transaction gains and losses are recorded in Other income, net on our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Derivatives and Hedging Activity. We use derivative instruments, including swaps, forward contracts and options, to help manage certain foreign currency, and from time to time to help manage interest rate and commodity price exposures. Derivative instruments are viewed as risk management tools by us and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. By their nature, all financial instruments involve market and credit risks. We enter into derivative and other financial instruments with major investment grade financial institutions and have policies to monitor the credit risk of those counterparties. We limit counterparty exposure and concentration of risk by diversifying counterparties. While there can be no assurance, we do not anticipate any material non-performance by any of these counterparties. We enter into transactions that are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements with various counterparties. However, we have not elected to offset multiple contracts with a single counterparty and, as a result, the fair value of the derivative instruments in a loss position is not offset against the fair value of derivative instruments in a gain position. Derivatives used for hedging purposes may be designated and effective as a hedge of the identified risk exposure at the inception of the contract. All derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives used to hedge foreign currency denominated balance sheet items are reported directly in earnings along with offsetting transaction gains and losses on the items being hedged. Derivatives used to hedge forecasted cash flows associated with foreign currency commitments or forecasted commodity purchases may be accounted for as cash flow hedges, as deemed appropriate. Gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified to earnings as a component of products sales or expenses, as applicable, when the hedged transaction occurs. Cash payments or receipts on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in Other operating activities, net within the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. To the extent that a previously designated hedging transa ction is no longer an effective hedge, any ineffectiveness measured in the hedging relationship is recorded currently in earnings in the period it occurs. 78 Table of Contents To the extent the hedge accounting criteria are not met, the foreign currency forward contracts are utilized as economic hedges and changes in the fair value of these contracts are recorded currently in earnings in the period in which they occur. Cash receipts or payments related to the settlement of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded as investing cash flows within the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Additional information pertaining to foreign currency forward contracts and net investment hedging is included in “Note 15: Financial Instruments.” Environmental . Environmental investigatory, remediation, operating and maintenance costs are accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site, including existing technology, current laws and regulations and prior remediation experience. Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, the minimum is accrued. For sites with multiple responsible parties, we consider our likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation costs and the ability of the other parties to fulfill their obligations in establishing a provision for those costs. Liabilities with fixed or reliably determinable future cash payments are discounted. A portion of these costs is eligible for future recovery through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government. We regularly assess the probability of recovery of these costs, which requires us to make assumptions about the extent of cost recovery under our contracts and the amount of future contract activity with the U.S. government. We consider such recovery probable based on government contracting regulations and our history of receiving reimbursement for such costs, and accordingly have recorded the future recovery of these costs from the U.S. government within Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Accrued environmental liabilities are not reduced by potential insurance reimbursements or potential recoveries from pursuing other parties. We also lease certain government-owned properties and generally are not liable for remediation of preexisting environmental contamination at these sites. As a result, we generally do not provide for these costs in our Consolidated Financial Statements. See “Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies” for additional details on the environmental remediation activities. Pension and Postretirement Obligations. U.S. GAAP requires balance sheet recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of pension and postretirement benefit (PRB) plans. Funded status is measured at least annually in the fourth quarter and represents the difference between the plans’ projected benefit obligation (PBO) and the fair market value of the plans’ assets. Changes to our pension and PRB plans’ funded status can result from company actions, such as contributions or changes in plan provisions, or by gains and losses. Gains and losses are primarily a result of changes in assumptions and actual experience that differs from these assumptions. Major assumptions include the discount rate and expected return on plan assets (EROA). These gains or losses are recorded in other comprehensive income, net of tax effects, until they are amortized as a component of net periodic benefit (income) expense. A calculated “market-related value” of our plan assets is used to develop the amount of deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized. The market-related value of assets is equal to the fair value of assets adjusted to reflect the recognition, and subsequent amortization, of the difference between actual and expected asset returns over a five-year period. The market-related value of assets is used to calculate the expected return on assets included in the net periodic benefit (income) expense. The Company has elected to use the “corridor” approach in the amortization of gains and losses, which limits the expense recognition to the net outstanding gains and losses in excess of the greater of 10% of the PBO or 10% of the market-related value of assets. Gains and losses exceeding the corridor are amortized in net periodic benefit (income) expense over either the projected average remaining employee service period or the projected average remaining lifetime of inactive participants depending on the plan. Net periodic benefit (income) expense is classified between operating and non-operating, whereby only the service cost component is included in operating profit and the remaining components are included in Non-service pension (income) expense. Product Performance Obligations. We extend performance and operating cost guarantees beyond our normal service and warranty policies for extended periods on some of our products, particularly commercial aircraft engines. Liability under such guarantees is based upon future product performance and durability. We accrue for such costs that are probable and can be reasonably estimated. In addition, we incur discretionary costs to service our products in connection with product performance issues. The costs associated with these product performance and operating cost guarantees require estimates over the full terms of the agreements, and require management to consider factors such as the extent of future maintenance requirements, interval between flight and repair time and the future cost of material and labor to perform the services. These cost estimates are largely based upon historical experience. See “Note 18: Guarantees” for further discussion. Accounting Pronouncements. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. This ASU and its related amendments (collectively, the Credit Loss Standard) modifies the impairment model to utilize an expected loss methodology in place of the incurred loss 79 Table of Contents methodology for financial instruments, including trade receivables, contract assets and off-balance sheet credit exposures. The Credit Loss Standard requires consideration of a broader range of information to estimate expected credit losses, including historical information, current economic conditions and a reasonable forecast period. This ASU requires that the statement of operations reflect estimates of expected credit losses for newly recognized financial assets as well as changes in the estimate of expected credit losses that have taken place during the period, which may result in earlier recognition of certain losses. We adopted this standard effective January 1, 2020 utilizing a modified retrospective approach. A cumulative-effect non-cash adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2020 was recorded in the amount of $ 59 million. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. The amendments in this update remove certain exceptions of Topic 740 including: the exception to the incremental approach for intraperiod tax allocation when there is a loss from continuing operations and income or gain from other items; the exception to the requirement to recognize a deferred tax liability for equity method investments when a foreign subsidiary becomes an equity method investment; the exception to the ability not to recognize a deferred tax liability for a foreign subsidiary when a foreign equity method investment becomes a subsidiary; and the exception to the general methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period when a year-to-date loss exceeds the anticipated loss for the year. There are also additional areas of guidance in regards to franchise and other taxes partially based on income and the interim recognition of enactment of tax laws and rate changes. We adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2021. The adoption of this standard did not have an impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Other new pronouncements issued but not effective until after December 31, 2021 did not and are not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. NOTE 2: BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS, GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS Business Acquisitions. Our investments in businesses, net of cash acquired, in 2021, 2020 and 2019 totaled $ 1.1 billion, $ 35.1 billion and $ 9 million, respectively. Our investments in business in 2021 primarily consisted of the acquisitions discussed below. Our investments in businesses in 2020 primarily consisted of the acquisition of Raytheon Company. In November 2021, we completed the acquisitions of FlightAware and SEAKR Engineering Inc., for a total of approximately $ 1.1 billion, net of cash received. FlightAware is a leading digital aviation company providing global flight tracking solutions, predictive technology, analytics and decision-making tools, and is reported in the Collins Aerospace segment. SEAKR Engineering Inc. is a leading supplier of advanced space electronics and is reported in the RIS segment. In connection with these acquisitions, we have preliminarily recorded $ 0.8 billion of goodwill and $ 0.3 billion of intangibles assets. The purchase price allocation processes for these acquisitions are expected to be complete in 2022 after the conclusion of our final reviews. In December 2020, we completed the acquisition of Blue Canyon Technologies, a leading provider of small satellites and spacecraft systems components for $ 425 million, net of cash received. Blue Canyon Technologies is reported in the RIS segment. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded $ 281 million of goodwill, primarily related to expected synergies from combining operations and the value of the existing workforce, which is deductible for tax purposes, and $ 149 million of intangible assets, primarily related to customer relationships. Pro forma financial information and revenue from the date of acquisition have not been provided for these acquisitions as they are not material either individually or in the aggregate. Raytheon Merger. As discussed in “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles”, on April 3, 2020, UTC and Raytheon Company completed an all-stock merger of equals, following the completion by UTC of the Separation Transactions and Distributions. Raytheon Company (previously New York Stock Exchange (NYSE): RTN) shares ceased trading prior to the market open on April 3, 2020, and each share of Raytheon common stock was converted in the merger into the right to receive 2.3348 shares of UTC common stock, previously traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “UTX.” Upon closing of the Raytheon Merger, UTC’s name was changed to “Raytheon Technologies Corporation,” and its shares of common stock began trading as of April 3, 2020 on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “RTX.” Total consideration is calculated as follows: (dollars in millions) Amount Fair value of RTC common stock issued for Raytheon Company outstanding common stock and vested equity awards $ 33,067 Fair value attributable to pre-merger service for replacement equity awards 99 Total merger consideration $ 33,166 80 Table of Contents The fair value of RTC common stock issued for Raytheon Company outstanding common stock and vested equity awards is calculated as follows: (dollars and shares in millions, except per share amounts and exchange ratio) Amount Number of Raytheon Company common shares outstanding as of April 3, 2020 277.3 Number of Raytheon Company stock awards vested as a result of the Raytheon Merger (1) 0.4 Total outstanding shares of Raytheon Company common stock and equity awards entitled to merger consideration 277.7 Exchange ratio (2) 2.3348 Shares of RTC common stock issued for Raytheon Company outstanding common stock and vested equity awards 648.4 Price per share of RTC common stock (3) $ 51.00 Fair value of RTC common stock issued for Raytheon Company outstanding common stock and vested equity awards $ 33,067 (1) Represents Raytheon Company stock awards that vested as a result of the Raytheon Merger, which is considered a “change in control” for purposes of the Raytheon 2010 Stock Plan. Certain Raytheon Company restricted stock awards and Raytheon Company restricted stock unit (RSU) awards, issued under the Raytheon 2010 Stock Plan vested on an accelerated basis as a result of the Raytheon Merger. Such vested awards were converted into the right to receive RTC common stock determined as the product of (1) the number of vested awards, and (2) the exchange ratio. (2) The exchange ratio is equal to 2.3348 shares of UTC common stock for each share of Raytheon Company common stock in accordance with the Raytheon Merger Agreement. (3) The price per share of RTC common stock is based on the RTC opening stock price as of April 3, 2020. Allocation of Consideration Transferred to Net Assets Acquired. We accounted for the Raytheon Merger under the acquisition method and are required to measure identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed of the acquiree (Raytheon Company) at the fair values on the closing date. During the first quarter of 2021, based on the finalization of our valuation and internal reviews, we completed the purchase price allocation which resulted in a net increase to goodwill of $ 61 million. The final purchase price allocation, net of cash acquired, for the acquisition was as follows: (dollars in millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,208 Accounts receivable 1,997 Contract assets 6,023 Inventory 705 Other assets, current 940 Fixed assets 4,745 Operating lease right-of-use assets 950 Intangible assets 19,130 Other assets 1,218 Total identifiable assets acquired 38,916 Accounts payable 1,477 Accrued employee compensation 1,492 Other accrued liabilities 1,921 Contract liabilities 3,002 Long-term debt, including current portion 4,700 Operating lease liabilities, non-current portion 738 Future pension and postretirement benefit obligation 11,607 Other long-term liabilities 2,368 Total liabilities acquired 27,305 Total identifiable net assets 11,611 Goodwill 21,589 Redeemable noncontrolling interest ( 34 ) Total consideration transferred $ 33,166 Fair value adjustments to Raytheon Company’s identified assets and liabilities included an increase in fixed assets of 81 Table of Contents $ 1.1 billion and an increase to future pension and postretirement benefit obligations of $ 3.6 billion, primarily related to remeasurement of the liability based on market conditions on the Raytheon Merger closing date. For further information, see “Note 11: Employee Benefit Plans.” In determining the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, a review was conducted for any significant contingent assets or liabilities existing as of the closing date. The assessment did not note any material contingencies related to existing legal or government action. The fair values of the customer relationship intangible assets were determined by using a discounted cash flow valuation method, which is a form of the income approach. Under this approach, the estimated future cash flows attributable to the asset are adjusted to exclude the future cash flows that can be attributed to supporting assets, such as tradenames or fixed assets. Both the amount and the duration of the cash flows are considered from a market participant perspective. Our estimates of market participant future cash flows, which required significant management judgment, included forecasted revenue growth rates, remaining developmental effort, operational performance including company specific synergies, program life cycles, material and labor pricing, and other relevant customer, contractual and market factors. Where appropriate, the net cash flows were probability-adjusted to reflect the uncertainties associated with the underlying assumptions, including cancellation rates related to backlog, government demand for sole-source and recompete contracts and win rates for recompete contracts, as well as the risk profile of the net cash flows utilized in the valuation. The probability-adjusted future cash flows were then discounted to present value, using an appropriate discount rate that required significant judgment by management. The customer relationship intangible assets are being amortized based on the pattern of economic benefits we expect to realize over the estimated economic life of the underlying programs. The fair value of the tradename intangible assets were determined utilizing the relief from royalty method which is a form of the income approach. Under this method, a royalty rate based on observed market royalties is applied to projected revenue supporting the tradename and discounted to present value, using forecasted revenue growth rate projections and a discount rate, respectively, that required significant judgment by management. The tradename intangible assets were determined to have an indefinite life. The developed technology intangible assets are being amortized based on the pattern of economic benefits. The intangible assets included above consist of the following: (dollars in millions) Fair Value Useful Life Acquired customer relationships $ 12,900 25 years Acquired tradenames 5,430 Indefinite Acquired developed technology 800 5 to 7 years Total identifiable intangible assets $ 19,130 We also identified customer contractual obligations on loss making programs and recorded liabilities of $ 222 million related to these programs based on the difference between the actual expected operating loss and a normalized operating profit. These liabilities are being liquidated based on the expected pattern of expenses incurred on these contracts. We recorded $ 21.6 billion of goodwill as a result of the Raytheon Merger which primarily relates to expected synergies from combining operations and the value of the existing workforce. The goodwill generated as a result of the Raytheon Merger is nondeductible for tax purposes. Merger-Related Costs. Merger-related costs have been expensed as incurred. In 2021 and 2020, we recorded $ 17 million and $ 142 million, respectively, of Raytheon Merger transaction and integration costs. These costs were recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Supplemental Pro-Forma Data. Raytheon Company’s results of operations have been included in RTC’s financial statements for the period subsequent to the completion of the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020. The following unaudited supplemental pro-forma data presents consolidated information as if the Raytheon Merger had been completed on January 1, 2019. The pro-forma results were calculated by combining the results of Raytheon Technologies with the stand-alone results of Raytheon Company for the pre-acquisition periods, which were adjusted to account for certain costs that would have been incurred during this pre-acquisition period. The results below reflect Raytheon Technologies on a continuing operations basis, in order to more 82 Table of Contents accurately represent the structure of Raytheon Technologies after completion of the Separation Transactions, the Distributions and the Raytheon Merger. (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2020 2019 Net sales $ 64,087 $ 74,238 Income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners ( 2,167 ) 6,544 Basic earnings (loss) per share of common stock from continuing operations $ ( 1.43 ) $ 4.34 Diluted earnings (loss) per share of common stock from continuing operations ( 1.43 ) 4.31 The unaudited supplemental pro-forma data above includes the following significant adjustments made to account for certain costs which would have been incurred if the acquisition had been completed on January 1, 2019, as adjusted for the applicable tax impact. As the merger was completed on April 3, 2020, the pro-forma adjustments in the table below only include the required adjustments through April 3, 2020. (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 Amortization of acquired Raytheon Company intangible assets, net (1) $ ( 270 ) $ ( 1,048 ) Amortization of fixed asset fair value adjustment (2) ( 9 ) ( 38 ) Utilization of contractual customer obligation (3) 8 57 Deferred revenue fair value adjustment (4) ( 4 ) ( 33 ) Adjustment to non-service pension (income) expense (5) 239 832 RTC/Raytheon fees for advisory, legal, accounting services (6) 134 ( 134 ) Adjustment to interest expense related to the Raytheon Merger, net (7) 9 36 Elimination of deferred commission amortization (8) 5 20 $ 112 $ ( 308 ) (1) Reflects the additional amortization of the acquired Raytheon Company’s intangible assets recognized at fair value in purchase accounting and eliminates the historical Raytheon Company intangible asset amortization expense. (2) Reflects the amortization of the fixed asset fair value adjustment as of the acquisition date. (3) Reflects the additional amortization of liabilities recognized for certain acquired loss making contracts as of the acquisition date. (4) Reflects the difference between prepayments related to extended arrangements and the fair value of the assumed performance obligations as they are satisfied. (5) Represents the elimination of unamortized prior service costs and actuarial losses, as a result of fair value purchase accounting. (6) Reflects the elimination of transaction-related fees incurred by RTC and Raytheon Company in connection with the Raytheon Merger and assumes all of the fees were incurred during the first quarter of 2019. (7) Reflects the amortization of the fair market value adjustment related to Raytheon Company. (8) Reflects the elimination of amortization recognized on deferred commissions that are eliminated in purchase accounting. The unaudited supplemental pro-forma financial information does not reflect the potential realization of cost savings related to the integration of the two companies. Further, the pro-forma data should not be considered indicative of the results that would have occurred if the acquisition had been consummated on January 1, 2019, nor are they indicative of future results. Dispositions. In 2021, 2020 and 2019 cash inflows related to dispositions were $ 1,879 million, $ 2,556 million and $ 134 million, respectively. Our dispositions of businesses in 2021, 2020 and 2019 consisted of the dispositions discussed below and other immaterial dispositions in our aerospace businesses. In September 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to divest our global training and services business within our RIS segment, which we completed in December 2021, for approximately $ 0.9 billion in cash and other consideration, resulting in an aggregate pre-tax gain, net of transaction costs, of $ 251 million ($ 135 million after tax), which includes a $ 12 million pre-tax gain recognized in Non-service pension income. In October 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Forcepoint business, which we completed on January 8, 2021, for proceeds of $ 1.1 billion, net of cash transferred. At December 31, 2020, the related assets of approximately $ 1.9 billion and liabilities of approximately $ 855 million were accounted for as held for sale at fair value less cost to sell; however, Forcepoint did not qualify for presentation as discontinued operations. These held for sale assets and liabilities are presented in Other assets, current and Other accrued liabilities, respectively, on our December 31, 2020 Consolidated Balance Sheet. Assets held for sale included $ 1.4 billion of goodwill and intangible assets. We did not recognize a pre-tax gain or loss within the Consolidated Statement of Operations related to the sale of Forcepoint. The results of Forcepoint were included in Eliminations and other in our segment results. 83 Table of Contents In the third quarter of 2020, in accordance with conditions imposed for regulatory approval of the Raytheon Merger, we completed the sale of our Collins Aerospace military Global Positioning System (GPS) and space-based precision optics businesses for $ 2.3 billion in cash, resulting in an aggregate pre-tax gain, net of transaction costs, of $ 580 million ($ 253 million after tax), of which $ 608 million was included in Other income (expense), net partially offset by $ 20 million of aggregate transaction costs included in Selling, general and administrative costs and an $ 8 million expense included in Non-service pension income within our Consolidated Statement of Operations. In May 2020, in order to meet the requirements for regulatory approval of the Raytheon Merger, we completed the sale of our airborne tactical radios business within our RIS segment for $ 231 million in cash, net of transaction-related costs. As the transaction occurred subsequent to the Raytheon Merger, the gain of $ 199 million was not recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Operations, but rather was recorded as an adjustment to the fair value of net assets acquired in the allocation of consideration transferred to net assets acquired in the Raytheon Merger. Goodwill. Changes in our goodwill balances for the year ended in 2021 were as follows: (dollars in millions) Balance as of January 1, 2021 (1) Acquisitions and Divestitures Foreign currency translation and other Balance as of December 31, 2021 Collins Aerospace Systems $ 31,571 $ 228 $ ( 415 ) $ 31,384 Pratt & Whitney 1,563 — — 1,563 Raytheon Intelligence & Space (1) 9,522 286 5 9,813 Raytheon Missiles & Defense (1) 11,608 52 ( 1 ) 11,659 Total Segment 54,264 566 ( 411 ) 54,419 Eliminations and other 21 — ( 4 ) 17 Total $ 54,285 $ 566 $ ( 415 ) $ 54,436 (1) In connection with the previously announced January 1, 2021 reorganization of RIS and RMD, goodwill of $ 282 million was allocated from RMD to RIS on a relative fair value basis and is reflected in the revised balances at January 1, 2021. The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired. We completed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of October 1, 2021, where we compared the fair value of all of our reporting units to their respective carrying values (step 1) and determined that no adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill were necessary. We estimated the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow (DCF) model based on our most recent long-range plan in place at the time of our impairment testing. The key assumptions used in the DCF analysis include our business projections, including revenue growth rates and operating profit margins, the long-term growth rate used to calculate the terminal value of the reporting unit, and the discount rate. We consider both internal and external factors and refresh key assumptions annually or as considered necessary. As part of our 2021 analysis, we used a slightly higher long-term growth rate assumption as compared to our 2020 analysis, based on our review of historical growth rates for our business and industry, long-term inflation estimates, and industry reports on projected future long-term growth for the industry. Material changes in these estimates could occur and result in impairments in future periods. Based on our annual impairment analysis as of October 1, 2021, the reporting unit that was closest to impairment was a Collins Aerospace reporting unit with a fair value in excess of book value, including goodwill, of 15 %. All other factors being equal, a 10% decrease in expected future cash flows, either due to a delay in the return to pre-pandemic revenue levels or other factors, would result in an excess of fair value over net book value of approximately 3 %. Alternatively, all other factors being equal, a 50 basis points decrease in the assumed long-term growth rate would result in an excess of fair value over net book value of approximately 7 %. The discount rate that we used in our 2021 analysis was consistent with the discount rate used in our 2020 analysis. All other factors being equal, a 50 basis points increase in the discount rate would result in an excess of fair value over net book value of approximately 4 %. All other reporting units had a fair value substantially in excess of book value. We considered the deterioration in general economic and market conditions primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic to be a triggering event in the first and second quarters of 2020, requiring an impairment evaluation of goodwill, intangible assets, net and other assets in our commercial aerospace businesses, Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney. Beginning in the second quarter of 2020, we observed several airline customer bankruptcies, delays and cancellations of aircraft purchases by airlines, fleet retirements and repositioning of OEM production schedules and we experienced significant unfavorable EAC adjustments at our Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney businesses due to a decline in flight hours, aircraft fleet utilization, shop visits and commercial OEM deliveries. These factors contributed to a deterioration of our expectations regarding the timing of a return to pre-COVID-19 commercial flight activity, which further reduced our future sales and cash flows expectations. In the 84 Table of Contents second quarter of 2020, we evaluated the Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney reporting units for goodwill impairment and determined that the carrying values of two of the six Collins Aerospace reporting units exceeded the sum of discounted future cash flows, resulting in goodwill impairments of $ 3.2 billion. Goodwill impairment was not indicated for any of the other reporting units evaluated for impairment in any of these scenarios. The Company continuously monitors and evaluates relevant events and circumstances that could unfavorably impact the key assumptions in determining the fair value of our reporting units, including long-term revenue growth projections, profitability and expectations for net cash flows, discount rates including changes to U.S. treasury rates and equity risk premiums, tax rates, recent market valuations from transactions by comparable companies, volatility in the Company’s market capitalization, and general industry, market and macro-economic conditions. It is possible that future changes in such circumstances, including significant future negative developments in the COVID-19 pandemic, or future changes in the inputs and assumptions used in estimating the fair value of our reporting units, including the expected long-term recovery of airline travel to pre-COVID-19 levels, would require the Company to record a non-cash impairment charge. Intangible Assets. Identifiable intangible assets are comprised of the following: 2021 2020 (dollars in millions) Gross Amount Accumulated Amortization Gross Amount Accumulated Amortization Amortized: Patents and trademarks $ 96 $ ( 37 ) $ 48 $ ( 35 ) Collaboration assets 5,319 ( 1,173 ) 5,021 ( 1,024 ) Exclusivity assets 2,673 ( 318 ) 2,541 ( 295 ) Developed technology and other 1,118 ( 429 ) 906 ( 316 ) Customer relationships 29,982 ( 7,411 ) 30,241 ( 5,262 ) 39,188 ( 9,368 ) 38,757 ( 6,932 ) Indefinite-lived: Trademarks and other 8,696 — 8,714 — Total $ 47,884 $ ( 9,368 ) $ 47,471 $ ( 6,932 ) We completed our annual indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment testing as of October 1, 2021. Based on this analysis, all of our indefinite-lived intangible assets had a fair value substantially in excess of book value. In 2020, given the deterioration in general economic and market conditions primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we performed an assessment of our indefinite-lived intangible assets and recorded charges of $ 57 million related to the impairment of an indefinite-lived tradename intangible assets at Collins Aerospace. We will continue to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our customers and our business in future periods which may result in a different conclusion. Amortization of intangible assets was $ 2,439 million, $ 2,125 million and $ 1,244 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The following is the expected amortization of total intangible assets for 2022 through 2026, which reflects the pattern of expected economic benefit on certain aerospace intangible assets: (dollars in millions) 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Amortization expense $ 1,997 $ 2,096 $ 2,174 $ 2,061 $ 1,977 NOTE 3: DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS As discussed above, on April 3, 2020 UTC separated into three independent, publicly traded companies – UTC, Carrier and Otis and distributed all of the outstanding common stock of Carrier and Otis to UTC shareowners who held shares of U TC common stock as of the close of business on March 19, 2020. 85 Table of Contents Carrier and Otis are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented.

In addition, 2020 includes debt extinguishment costs related to the Company’s paydown of debt to not exceed the maximum applicable net indebtedness under the Raytheon Merger Agreement. Selected financial information related to cash flows from discontinued operations is as follows: (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities $ ( 71 ) $ ( 728 ) $ 3,062 Net cash used in investing activities — ( 241 ) ( 416 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 71 ( 1,414 ) ( 2,651 ) Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities includes the net operating cash flows of Carrier and Otis prior to the Separation Transactions, as well as costs incurred by the Company primarily related to professional services costs pertaining to the Separation Transactions and the establishment of Carrier and Otis as stand-alone public companies, facility relocation costs, costs to separate information systems, costs of retention bonuses and tax charges related to separation activities. Net cash used in financing activities primarily consists of net cash transfers from Carrier and Otis to the Company, as well as debt extinguishment costs related to the early repayment of debt in 2020. The Separation of Carrier was treated as a return on capital and recorded as a reduction to retained earnings, as it was in a net asset position, while the Separation of Otis was treated as a return of capital and recorded as an adjustment to Common stock, as it was in a net liability position. NOTE 4: EARNINGS PER SHARE (dollars in millions, except per share amounts; shares in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Net income (loss) attributable to common shareowners: Income (loss) from continuing operations $ 3,897 $ ( 3,109 ) $ 3,510 Income (loss) from discontinued operations ( 33 ) ( 410 ) 2,027 Net income (loss) attributable to common shareowners $ 3,864 $ ( 3,519 ) $ 5,537 Basic weighted average number of shares outstanding 1,501.6 1,357.8 854.8 Stock awards and equity units (share equivalent) 6.9 — 9.1 Diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding 1,508.5 1,357.8 863.9 Earnings (Loss) per share attributable to common shareowners - basic Income (loss) from continuing operations $ 2.60 $ ( 2.29 ) $ 4.11 Income (loss) from discontinued operations ( 0.03 ) ( 0.30 ) 2.37 Net income (loss) attributable to common shareowners $ 2.57 $ ( 2.59 ) $ 6.48 Earnings (Loss) per share attributable to common shareowners - diluted Income (loss) from continuing operations $ 2.58 $ ( 2.29 ) $ 4.06 Income (loss) from discontinued operations ( 0.02 ) ( 0.30 ) 2.35 Net income (loss) attributable to common shareowners $ 2.56 $ ( 2.59 ) $ 6.41 The computation of diluted EPS excludes the effect of the potential exercise of stock awards, including stock appreciation rights and stock options, when the average market price of the common stock is lower than the exercise price of the related stock awards during the period because the effect would be anti-dilutive. In addition, the computation of diluted EPS excludes the effect of the potential exercise of stock awards when the awards’ assumed proceeds exceed the average market price of the common shares during the period. For 2021 and 2019, there were 13.4 million and 8.3 million stock awards excluded from the computation, respectively. For 2020, all stock awards were excluded from the computation of diluted EPS because their effect was antidilutive due to the loss from continuing operations, and amounted 32.5 million stock awards. 87 Table of Contents NOTE 5: ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET Accounts receivable, net consisted of the following: (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 U.S. government contracts (including foreign military sales) $ 1,204 $ 1,039 Other customers 8,932 8,761 Allowance for expected credit losses ( 475 ) ( 546 ) Total accounts receivable, net $ 9,661 $ 9,254 The changes in the allowance for expected credit losses related to Accounts receivable were as follows: (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 Balance as of January 1 $ 546 $ 254 Current period provision for expected credit losses, net of recoveries (1) ( 47 ) 277 Write-offs charged against the allowance for expected credit losses ( 18 ) ( 5 ) Other, net (2) ( 6 ) 20 Balance as of December 31 $ 475 $ 546 (1) The current provision for expected credit losses for 2020 includes $ 248 million of reserves driven by customer bankruptcies and additional reserves for credit losses primarily due to the economic environment primarily caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. (2) Other, net for 2020 includes a $ 34 million impact related to the January 1, 2020 adoption of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was not material in 2019. NOTE 6: CONTRACT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES Contract assets reflect revenue recognized and performance obligations satisfied in advance of customer billing. Contract liabilities relate to payments received in advance of the satisfaction of performance under the contract. We receive payments from customers based on the terms established in our contracts. Total contract assets and contract liabilities as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 are as follows: (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 Contract assets $ 11,361 $ 9,931 Contract liabilities ( 13,720 ) ( 12,889 ) Net contract liabilities $ ( 2,359 ) $ ( 2,958 ) Contract assets increased $ 1,430 million during 2021 primarily due to sales in excess of billings at Pratt & Whitney and contractual billing terms on U.S. government and foreign military sales contracts at RMD. Contract liabilities increased $ 831 million during 2021 primarily due to billings in excess of sales at Pratt & Whitney and timing of milestone payments on certain international contracts at RMD, partially offset by $ 381 million of contract liability reduction related to a contract termination at Collins Aerospace. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recognized revenue of $ 4,301 million, $ 2,763 million and $ 2,850 million related to our Contract liabilities at January 1, 2021, January 1, 2020 and January 1, 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, our Contract liabilities include approximately $ 430 million of advance payments received from a Middle East customer on contracts for which we no longer believe we will be able to execute on or obtain required regulatory approvals. These advance payments may become refundable to the customer if the contracts are ultimately terminated. Contract assets consisted of the following at December 31: (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 Unbilled $ 23,652 $ 20,336 Progress payments ( 12,291 ) ( 10,405 ) Total contract assets $ 11,361 $ 9,931 The U.S. government has title to the assets related to unbilled amounts on U.S. government contracts that provide progress payments. 88 Table of Contents Contract assets are net of an allowance for expected credit losses of $ 251 million and $ 177 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The allowance for expected credit losses activity was not material in 2021. In 2020, we recognized incremental credit loss reserves of $ 132 million related to a number of airline customers that have filed for bankruptcy and additional reserves due to the economic environment primarily caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, in 2020, we recognized an impairment of $ 111 million of contract assets at Collins Aerospace due to the impact of lower estimated future customer activity principally driven by the expected acceleration of fleet retirements of a certain commercial aircraft type, and we recognized an impairment of $ 129 million of contract assets as a result of an unfavorable EAC adjustment related to lower estimated revenues due to the restructuring of a customer contract at Pratt & Whitney. NOTE 7: INVENTORY, NET (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 Raw materials $ 3,024 $ 3,015 Work-in-process 3,085 2,924 Finished goods 3,069 3,472 Total inventory, net $ 9,178 $ 9,411 Raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods are net of total valuation reserves of $ 2.0 billion and $ 1.8 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. NOTE 8: COMMERCIAL AEROSPACE INDUSTRY ASSETS AND COMMITMENTS The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected our business, supply chains, operations and the industries in which we operate. As a result of COVID-19, governments, businesses and individuals have taken actions such as instituting lockdowns, quarantines, border closings and other travel restrictions and requirements, adopting remote working and reducing business and leisure travel, which collectively led to an unprecedented decline in demand for commercial air travel. The unprecedented decrease in air travel adversely affected our airline and airframer customers and their demand for our products and services of our Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney businesses. Refer to “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” for further details. While we have seen indications that commercial air travel is recovering, we continue to closely monitor our commercial aerospace assets for recoverability and our off-balance sheet exposures. The following summarizes certain significant assets and off-balance sheet exposures specifically related to our commercial aerospace customers: (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 Assets related to commercial aerospace industry customers: Accounts receivable, net (Note 5) $ 7,235 $ 7,239 Contract assets (Note 6) 3,264 2,559 Customer financing assets (1) (Note 1) 2,945 3,160 Contract fulfillment costs (Note 1) 1,711 1,773 Guarantees and Commitments related to commercial aerospace industry customers: Commercial aerospace guarantees (net of reserves and collaboration partners’ share) (Note 18) 165 174 Commercial aerospace commitments (net of collaboration partners’ share) (Note 19) 9,659 8,515 (1) Customer financing assets is inclusive of both the current and long term balances. We also have goodwill and intangible assets, including exclusivity assets and collaboration assets, associated with our commercial aerospace business. Refer to “Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets” for further discussion. NOTE 9: FIXED ASSETS, NET Fixed assets, net, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Major improvements are capitalized while expenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor improvements are expensed. For sales or asset retirements, the assets and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are eliminated from the accounts. Gains and losses on sales of our Fixed assets, net, are generally recorded in operating income; however, for our RIS and RMD segments, gains and losses that are allocable to our contracts are 89 Table of Contents included in overhead, as we are required to allocate gains or losses and generally can recover these costs through the pricing of products and services to the U.S. government. (dollars in millions) Estimated Useful Lives 2021 2020 Land $ 765 $ 773 Buildings and improvements 10 - 45 years 7,271 7,067 Machinery, tools and equipment 3 - 20 years 16,729 15,994 Other, including assets under construction 2,872 2,512 Fixed assets, gross 27,637 26,346 Accumulated depreciation ( 12,665 ) ( 11,384 ) Fixed assets, net $ 14,972 $ 14,962 Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life of the improvement. Depreciation expense related to Fixed assets, net is recorded predominantly utilizing the straight-line method and was $ 1,828 million in 2021, $ 1,767 million in 2020 and $ 1,191 million in 2019. NOTE 10: BORROWINGS AND LINES OF CREDIT (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 Commercial paper $ — $ 160 Other borrowings 134 87 Total short-term borrowings $ 134 $ 247 As of December 31, 2021, our maximum commercial paper borrowing limit was $ 5.0 billion as the commercial paper is backed by our $ 5.0 billion revolving credit agreement. We use our commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes, including the funding of potential acquisitions, pension contributions, debt refinancing, dividend payments and repurchases of our common stock. The commercial paper notes have original maturities of not more than 90 days from the date of issuance. Interest rates on our commercial paper borrowings are considered variable due to their short-term duration and high-frequency of turnover. As of December 31, 2021, we had revolving credit agreements with various banks permitting aggregate borrowings of up to $ 7.0 billion, consisting of a $ 5.0 billion revolving credit agreement, which matures in April 2025, and a $ 2.0 billion revolving credit agreement, which we renewed in May 2021 and expires in May 2022. As of December 31, 2021, there were no borrowings outstanding under these agreements. In addition, at December 31, 2021, approximately $ 0.9 billion was available under short-term lines of credit with local banks at our various domestic and international subsidiaries. On November 17, 2021, we completed a cash tender offer for the notes included in the repayments table below (the Tender Offer Notes), resulting in a partial repayment of approximately $ 1.5 billion of aggregate principal on these notes. In connection with this transaction, we recorded debt extinguishment costs of $ 617 million, primarily related to premiums. We had the following issuances of long-term debt during 2021: Issuance Date Description of Notes Aggregate Principal Balance (in millions) November 16, 2021 2.375 % notes due 2032 (1) $ 1,000 3.030 % notes due 2052 (1) 1,100 August 10, 2021 1.900 % notes due 2031 (2) 1,000 2.820 % notes due 2051 (2) 1,000 (1) The net proceeds received from these debt issuances were used to fund the purchase of the Tender Offer Notes.

The average maturity of our long-term debt at December 31, 2021 is approximately 15 years. The schedule of principal payments required on long-term debt for the next five years and thereafter is: (in millions) 2022 $ 13 2023 588 2024 1,270 2025 1,590 2026 751 Thereafter 27,088 Total $ 31,300 NOTE 11: EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS We sponsor various domestic and foreign employee benefit plans, which are discussed below. Employee Savings Plans. We sponsor various employee savings plans. Our contributions to employer sponsored defined contribution plans were $ 962 million, $ 875 million and $ 485 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our non-union domestic employee savings plan for legacy UTC employees uses an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) for employer matching contributions. External borrowings were used by the ESOP to fund a portion of its purchase of ESOP stock from us. The external borrowings have been extinguished and only re-amortized loans remain between RTC and the ESOP Trust. As ESOP debt service payments are made, common stock is released from an unreleased shares account. ESOP debt may be prepaid or re-amortized to either increase or decrease the number of shares released so that the value of released shares equals the value of plan benefit. We may also, at our option, contribute additional common stock or cash to the ESOP. Shares of common stock are allocated to employees’ ESOP accounts at fair value on the date earned. Cash dividends on common stock held by the ESOP are used for debt service payments. Participants may choose to have their ESOP dividends reinvested or distributed in cash. Common stock allocated to ESOP participants is included in the average number of common 92 Table of Contents shares outstanding for both basic and diluted EPS. At December 31, 2021, 25.4 million common shares had been allocated to employees, leaving 7.2 million unallocated common shares in the ESOP Trust, with a fair value of $ 619 million. Pension and Postretirement Plans. We sponsor both funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension plans that cover a large number of our employees. Our largest plans are generally closed to new participants. We also sponsor both funded and unfunded PRB plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits to eligible retirees. Our plans use a December 31 measurement date consistent with our fiscal year. On April 3, 2020, UTC completed the Separation Transactions, which included the transfer of certain defined benefit plans from UTC to Carrier and Otis. The plans transferred were primarily international plans with the majority of the UTC defined benefit liability remaining with Raytheon Technologies. Upon separation, the pension participants within Carrier and Otis were effectively terminated from Raytheon Technologies. The terminations triggered a mid-year remeasurement of the UTC domestic plans. The remeasurement, which was calculated using discount rates and asset values as of April 3, 2020 (using March 31, 2020 as a practical expedient), resulted in a $ 2.4 billion increase to our pension liability, primarily due to a decrease in the fair market value of the plans’ assets since December 31, 2019. All service cost previously associated with Carrier and Otis was reclassified to discontinued operations. For non-service pension (income) expense and pension liabilities, generally only the portions related to the defined benefit plans transferred to Carrier and Otis as part of the Separation Transactions were reclassified to discontinued operations. Raytheon Company has both funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and PRB plans. As of the merger date, the Raytheon Company plans were remeasured at fair value using accounting policies consistent with the UTC plans. Refer to “Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets” for additional information. The deferred pension and PRB plan losses included in Raytheon Company’s accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of the merger date were eliminated and are no longer subject to amortization in net periodic benefit (income) expense. Amounts prior to the merger date of April 3, 2020 do not include the Raytheon Company pension plan results. In December 2020, we approved a change to the Raytheon Company domestic benefit pension plans for non-union participants to cease future benefit accruals based on an employee’s years of service and compensation effective December 31, 2022. The plan change does not impact participants’ historical benefit accruals. Benefits for service after December 31, 2022 will be based on a cash balance formula. We utilized a practical expedient and measured the plan assets and pension benefit obligations for the effected pension plans as of the nearest month end, December 31, 2020, resulting in a prior service credit of $ 2.1 billion. In September 2019, we amended the UTC domestic defined benefit pension plans to cease accrual of additional benefits for future service and compensation for non-union participants effective December 31, 2019. Beginning January 1, 2020, these participants began receiving additional contributions under the UTC domestic defined contribution plan. The plan change did not impact participants’ historical benefit accruals. We utilized the practical expedient and remeasured plan assets and pension benefit obligations for the affected pension plans as of the nearest month-end, August 31, 2019, resulting in a net actuarial loss of $ 425 million. We recorded a curtailment gain of $ 98 million in the Consolidated Statement of Operations during the third quarter of 2019 due to the recognition of previously unrecognized prior service credits for the affected pension plans. For non-union employees in the UTC domestic pension plans, benefits for service up to December 31, 2014 are generally based on the employee’s years of service and compensation. Benefits for service after December 31, 2014 and through December 31, 2019 are based on the existing cash balance formula that was adopted in 2003 for newly hired non-union employees and for non-union employees who made a one-time voluntary election to have future benefit accruals determined under this formula. Benefits for union employees in the UTC domestic pension plans are generally based on a stated amount for each year of service. We made the following contributions to our pension and PRB plans’ trusts during the years ended December 31: (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 U.S. qualified defined benefit plans $ — $ 885 $ 25 International defined benefit plans 42 125 30 PRB plans 17 15 — The contributions to our U.S. qualified defined benefit plans in 2020 include a $ 750 million discretionary contribution to the Raytheon Company U.S. qualified pension plans’ trust.

The majority of our pension obligations relate to our U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) qualified pension plans, which comprise 86 % and 85 % of our pension PBO as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 3 % of our pension PBO as of both December 31, 2021 and 2020 is attributable to our nonqualified domestic pension plans, which provide supplementary retirement benefits to certain employees in excess of the IRS qualified plan limits. International plans comprise 11 % and 12 % of the pension PBO as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are considered defined benefit pension plans for accounting purposes. 94 Table of Contents In addition to the pension and PRB noncurrent liabilities shown above, Future pension and postretirement benefit obligations on the Consolidated Balance Sheet includes $ 79 million and $ 139 million of other pension and PRB related liabilities as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

The Actuarial gain arising in 2021 was primarily due to an increase in discount rates during 2021 and asset returns exceeding our expected return on assets, partially offset by demographic losses. The Actuarial loss arising in 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in discount rates during 2020, partially offset by asset returns exceeding our expected return on assets. Current year prior service credit in 2020 was primarily due to the Raytheon Company plan change for non-union participants as discussed above. Other changes in PRB assets and benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive loss in 2021 and 2020 are as follows: (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 Actuarial (gain) loss arising during the period $ ( 88 ) $ 47 Amortization of actuarial gain 6 12 Current year prior service cost (credit) — ( 7 ) Amortization of prior service credit 3 3 Net settlement and curtailment — ( 1 ) Other — 5 Total recognized in other comprehensive (income) loss ( 79 ) 59 Net recognized in net periodic benefit (income) cost and other comprehensive loss $ ( 78 ) $ 75 The Actuarial gain arising in 2021 was primarily due to an increase in discount rates during 2021 and asset returns exceeding our expected return on assets on our funded plans. The Actuarial loss arising in 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in discount rates during 2020, partially offset by asset returns exceeding our expected return on assets on our funded plans. The table below reflects the total benefit payments expected to be paid from the plans or from corporate assets.

The PBO discount rate is used for the service cost and interest cost measurements for non-significant plans. Major assumptions used in determining the PRB benefit obligation and net periodic PRB (income) expense are presented in the following table as weighted-averages: Benefit Obligation Net Periodic Benefit (Income) Expense 2021 2020 2021 2020 2019 Discount rate 2.8 % 2.4 % 2.4 % 3.1 % 4.0 % Expected return on assets N/A N/A 5.7 % 5.7 % 7.0 % Assumed health care cost trend rates used in determining the PRB benefit obligation and net periodic PRB (income) expense are as follows: 2021 2020 Health care cost trend rate assumed for next year 4.7 % 5.0 % Ultimate health care cost trend rate 4.2 % 4.3 % Year that the rate reaches the ultimate health care cost trend rate 2026 2026 The weighted-average discount rates used to measure pension and PRB liabilities are based on yield curves developed using high-quality corporate bonds as well as plan specific expected cash flows. For our significant plans, we utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit expense by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant discounted projected cash flows. In determining the EROA assumption, we consider the target asset allocation of plan assets, as well as economic and other indicators of future performance. We may consult with and consider the opinions of financial and other professionals in determining the appropriate capital market assumptions. Return projections are validated using a simulation model that incorporates yield curves, credit spreads and risk premiums to project long-term prospective returns. As a result of this analysis at year end 2021, our weighted average pension EROA assumption for 2022 is 6.5 %. Plan Assets. The plans’ investment management objectives include providing the liquidity and asset levels needed to meet current and future benefit payments, while maintaining a prudent degree of portfolio diversification considering interest rate risk and market volatility. Globally, investment strategies generally target a mix of 50 % to 55 % of growth seeking assets and 45 % to 50 % of income generating and hedging assets using a wide set of diversified asset types, fund strategies and investment managers. The growth seeking allocation consists of global public equities in developed and emerging countries, private equity, real estate and multi-asset class strategies. Growth assets include an enhanced alpha strategy that invests in publicly traded equity and fixed income securities, derivatives and foreign currency. Investments in private equity are primarily via limited partnership interests in buy-out strategies with smaller allocations to distressed debt funds. The real estate strategy is principally concentrated in directly held U.S. core investments with some smaller investments in international, value-added and opportunistic strategies. Within the income generating assets, the fixed income portfolio consists of mainly government and broadly diversified high quality corporate bonds. The plans have continued their pension risk management techniques designed to reduce their interest rate risk. Specifically, the plans have incorporated liability hedging programs that include the adoption of a risk reduction objective as part of the long-term investment strategy. Under this objective the interest rate hedge is intended to increase as funded status improves. The 97 Table of Contents hedging programs incorporate a range of assets and investment tools, each with varying interest rate sensitivities. The investment portfolios are currently hedging approximately 30 % to 70 % of the interest rate sensitivity of the pension plan liabilities, depending on the funded status of the plan. The fair values of pension plan assets at December 31, 2021 and 2020 by asset category are as follows: (dollars in millions) Quoted Prices in Active Markets For Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Not Subject to Leveling (8) Total Asset Category: Public Equities Global Equities $ 9,411 $ 6 $ — $ — $ 9,417 Global Equity Commingled Funds (1) 3 929 — — 932 Enhanced Global Equities (2) 46 163 — — 209 Other Public Equities — — — 8,495 8,495 Private Equities (3) — — — 4,490 4,490 Fixed Income Securities Governments 1,933 1,172 — — 3,105 Corporate Bonds 1 18,681 — — 18,682 Structured Products — 25 — — 25 Other Fixed Income — — — 7,367 7,367 Real Estate (4) — — 1,885 1,743 3,628 Other (5) — 91 — 5,351 5,442 Cash & Cash Equivalents (6) — 111 — 220 331 Subtotal $ 11,394 $ 21,178 $ 1,885 $ 27,666 $ 62,123 Other Assets & Liabilities (7) 1,200 Total at December 31, 2021 $ 63,323 Public Equities Global Equities $ 8,437 $ 5 $ — $ — $ 8,442 Global Equity Commingled Funds (1) 1 2,686 — — 2,687 Enhanced Global Equities (2) 56 185 — — 241 Other Public Equities — — — 9,008 9,008 Private Equities (3) — — — 3,646 3,646 Fixed Income Securities Governments 1,740 1,480 — — 3,220 Corporate Bonds 3 18,489 2 305 18,799 Structured Products — 24 — — 24 Other Fixed Income — — — 6,631 6,631 Real Estate (4) — — 1,647 1,737 3,384 Other (5) — 99 — 5,088 5,187 Cash & Cash Equivalents (6) 9 97 — 154 260 Subtotal $ 10,246 $ 23,065 $ 1,649 $ 26,569 $ 61,529 Other Assets & Liabilities (7) 789 Total at December 31, 2020 $ 62,318 (1) Represents commingled funds that invest primarily in common stocks.

(8) In accordance with ASU 2015-07, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) , certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented for the total pension benefits plan assets. Derivatives in the plan are primarily used to manage risk and gain asset class exposure while still maintaining liquidity. Derivative instruments mainly consist of equity futures, interest rate futures, interest rate swaps and currency forward contracts. The fair market value of the plans’ derivatives through direct or separate account investments was approximately $ 98 million and $ 176 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We review our assets at least quarterly to ensure we are within the targeted asset allocation ranges and, if necessary, asset balances are adjusted back within target allocations. We employ a broadly diversified investment manager structure that includes diversification by active and passive management, style, capitalization, country, sector, industry and number of investment managers. No individual investment represented more than 5 % of the plan assets as of December 31, 2021. The fair value measurement of plan assets using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) changed due to the following: (dollars in millions) Private Equities Corporate Bonds Real Estate Total Balance, December 31, 2019 $ 202 $ 5 $ 1,464 $ 1,671 Realized gains — — 7 7 Unrealized gains (losses) relating to instruments still held in the reporting period 16 — ( 129 ) ( 113 ) Purchases, sales, and settlements, net 10 ( 3 ) 77 84 Transfers in/out, net ( 228 ) — 228 — Balance, December 31, 2020 — 2 1,647 1,649 Realized gains — — 212 212 Unrealized gains relating to instruments still held in the reporting period — — 50 50 Purchases, sales, and settlements, net — — ( 24 ) ( 24 ) Transfers in/out, net — ( 2 ) — ( 2 ) Balance, December 31, 2021 $ — $ — $ 1,885 $ 1,885 Quoted market prices are used to value investments when available. Investments in securities traded on exchanges, including listed futures and options, are valued at the last reported sale prices on the last business day of the year or, if not available, the last reported bid prices. Fixed income securities are primarily measured using a market approach pricing methodology, where observable prices are obtained by market transactions involving identical or comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings. Mortgages have been valued on the basis of their future principal and interest payments discounted at prevailing interest rates for similar investments. Investment contracts are valued at fair value by discounting the related cash flows based on current yields of similar instruments with comparable durations. Real estate investments are valued on a quarterly basis using discounted cash flow models which consider long-term lease estimates, future rental receipts and estimated residual values. Valuation estimates are supplemented by third-party appraisals on an annual basis. Private equity limited partnerships are valued quarterly using discounted cash flows, earnings multiples and market multiples. Valuation adjustments reflect changes in operating results, financial condition, or prospects of the applicable portfolio company. Over-the-counter securities and government obligations are valued at the bid prices or the average of the bid and ask prices on the last business day of the year from published sources or, if not available, from other sources considered reliable, generally broker quotes. Temporary cash investments are stated at cost, which approximates fair value. The fair market value of assets related to our PRB benefits was $ 389 million and $ 381 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These assets include $ 147 million and $ 149 million of which are invested in our domestic qualified pension plan trust at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The remaining PRB investments are held within Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trusts. The VEBA assets are generally invested in mutual funds and are valued primarily using quoted prices in active markets (Level 1). There were no Level 3 investments in the VEBA trusts as of December 31, 2021 or 2020. 99 Table of Contents We have set aside assets in separate trusts, which we expect to be used to pay for certain nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution plan obligations in excess of qualified plan limits. These assets are included in Other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair value of marketable securities held in trusts as of December 31 was as follows: (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 Marketable securities held in trusts $ 965 $ 881 NOTE 12: LEASES Operating lease expense was $ 525 million, $ 497 million, and $ 323 million for 2021, 2020, and 2019 respectively. Finance leases and leases where we are the lessor are not considered significant to our Consolidated Balance Sheet or Consolidated Statement of Operations. In both 2021 and 2020, we entered into sale and leaseback transactions for the sale of equipment and related maintenance. We subsequently leased back the equipment sold for a limited timeframe, which is accounted for as an operating lease. The proceeds received as a result of the equipment sales are classified in Receipts from customer financing assets within the Investing Activities in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, and the portion related to future maintenance services are classified within Operating Activities. The net gains as a result of these transactions were not material. Supplemental cash flow information related to operating leases were as follows: (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Operating cash flows used in the measurement of operating lease liabilities $ 490 $ 420 $ 411 Operating lease right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for operating lease obligations 535 299 123 Future lease payments related to our operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2021 are as follows: (dollars in millions) 2022 $ 421 2023 359 2024 295 2025 248 2026 198 Thereafter 839 Total undiscounted lease payments 2,360 Less imputed interest ( 292 ) Total discounted lease payments $ 2,068 Our lease liabilities recognized in our Consolidated Balance Sheet were as follows as of December 31: (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 Operating lease liabilities, current (included in Other accrued liabilities) $ 411 $ 482 Operating lease liabilities, noncurrent 1,657 1,516 Total operating lease liabilities $ 2,068 $ 1,998 The weighted-average remaining lease term related to our operating leases was 9 years and 8 years as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The weighted-average discount rate related to our operating leases was 2.8 % and 3.1 % as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 100 Table of Contents NOTE 13: INCOME TAXES Income Before Income Taxes.

For the remainder of the Company’s undistributed international earnings, unless tax effective to repatriate, the Company will continue to permanently reinvest these earnings. As of December 31, 2021, such undistributed earnings were approximately $ 15 billion, excluding other comprehensive income amounts. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable on the remaining amounts. Provision for Income Taxes.

In the first quarter of 2021, we recorded $ 148 million of tax charges associated with the sale of the Forcepoint business, and subsequently recognized a $ 104 million tax benefit due to the revaluation of that tax benefit as a result of completing the divestiture of RIS’s global training and services business for a gain in the fourth quarter of 2021. The 2020 negative effective tax rate is a result of having tax expense of $ 575 million on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $ 2.4 billion. The loss from continuing operations before income taxes in 2020 includes the $ 3.2 billion goodwill impairment as described in “Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets,” most of which was non-deductible for tax purposes. Tax expense includes net deferred tax charges of $ 416 million resulting from the Separation Transactions and the Raytheon Merger primarily related to the impairment of deferred tax assets and the revaluation of certain international tax incentives, and incremental tax expense of $ 177 million related to the disposal of businesses, including the sales of businesses at Collins Aerospace, the airborne tactical radios business at RIS and the entry into a definitive agreement to sell Forcepoint, as described in “Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets.” Also included in the 2020 effective tax rate are tax benefits of $ 142 million associated with U.S. research and development credits and $ 83 million associated with FDII. The 2019 effective tax rate includes tax benefits of $ 290 million primarily associated with the conclusion of the audit by the Examination Division of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the Company’s 2014, 2015 and 2016 tax years and the filing by a subsidiary of the Company to participate in an amnesty program offered by the Italian Tax Authority. The 2019 effective tax rate also includes tax benefits of $ 101 million related to U.S. research and development credits and $ 138 million associated with FDII. Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities. The tax effects of temporary differences and tax carryforwards which gave rise to future income tax benefits and payables at December 31, 2021 and 2020 are as follows: (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 Future income tax benefits: Insurance and employee benefits $ 1,831 $ 3,004 Inventory and contract balances 756 822 Warranty provisions 248 220 Other basis differences 878 637 Tax loss carryforwards 251 196 Tax credit carryforwards 1,088 959 Valuation allowances ( 825 ) ( 757 ) Total future income tax benefits $ 4,227 $ 5,081 Future income taxes payable: Goodwill and Intangible assets $ 7,168 $ 7,786 Fixed assets 1,746 1,637 Other basis differences 323 151 Total future income tax payable $ 9,237 $ 9,574 Valuation allowances have been established primarily for tax credit carryforwards, tax loss carryforwards, and certain temporary differences to reduce the future income tax benefits to expected realizable amounts. 102 Table of Contents Tax Credit and Loss Carryforwards. At December 31, 2021, tax credit carryforwards, principally state and foreign, and tax loss carryforwards, principally state and foreign, were as follows: (dollars in millions) Tax Credit Carryforwards Tax Loss Carryforwards Expiration period: 2022-2026 $ 65 $ 364 2027-2031 115 141 2032-2041 391 257 Indefinite 517 1,058 Total $ 1,088 $ 1,820 Unrecognized Tax Benefits. At December 31, 2021, we had gross tax-effected unrecognized tax benefits of $ 1,458 million, of which $ 1,313 million, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits and interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows: (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Balance at January 1 $ 1,225 $ 1,347 $ 1,619 Additions for tax positions related to the current year 110 125 131 Additions for tax positions of prior years 282 323 73 Reductions for tax positions of prior years ( 49 ) ( 83 ) ( 101 ) Settlements ( 110 ) ( 48 ) ( 375 ) Separation of Carrier and Otis — ( 439 ) — Balance at December 31 $ 1,458 $ 1,225 $ 1,347 Gross interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits $ 39 $ 50 $ 57 Total accrued interest balance at December 31 165 141 249 The unrecognized tax benefit table includes discontinued operations activity in 2020 and 2019. As a result of the Separation Transactions and the Distributions in April 2020, we transferred unrecognized tax benefits to Carrier and Otis of $ 439 million and associated interest of approximately $ 165 million. Pursuant to the terms of the separation agreements, certain other unrecognized tax benefits retained by the Company are subject to indemnification. Total unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2019 included $ 437 million of benefits related to discontinued operations, and associated interest of approximately $ 155 million. The 2020 additions for tax positions of prior years in the table above include amounts related to the Raytheon Merger. Management has determined that the distributions of Carrier and Otis on April 3, 2020, and certain related internal business separation transactions, qualified as tax-free under applicable law. In making these determinations, we applied the tax law in the relevant jurisdictions to our facts and circumstances and obtained tax rulings from the relevant taxing authorities, tax opinions, and/or other external tax advice related to the concluded tax treatment. If the completed distributions of Carrier or Otis, in each case, or certain internal business separation transactions, were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment, the Company could be subject to significant liabilities, and there could be material adverse impacts on the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity in future reporting periods. We conduct business globally and, as a result, Raytheon Technologies or one or more of our subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations for years before 2012. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company recognized a non-cash gain of approximately $ 25 million, primarily tax, as a result of the statute of limitations expiration of the 2016 tax year of a subsidiary acquired as part of the RTC’s acquisition of Rockwell Collins. 103 Table of Contents During 2019, the Company recognized a non-cash net gain of approximately $ 307 million, including pre-tax interest of approximately $ 56 million as a result of the conclusion of the IRS audit of the Company’s 2014, 2015 and 2016 tax years. The Examination Division of the IRS is currently auditing Raytheon Technologies tax years 2017 and 2018 and pre-merger Raytheon Company tax periods 2017, 2018 and 2019 as well as certain refund claims of Raytheon Company for tax years 2014, 2015 and 2016 filed prior to the Raytheon Merger. The Examination Division of the IRS is also auditing pre-acquisition Rockwell Collins fiscal tax years 2016 and 2017, which is projected to close within the next six to twelve months. As a result of the projected closure of the audit of Rockwell Collins fiscal tax years 2016 and 2017, it is reasonably possible that the Company may recognize non-cash gains in the range of $ 20 million to $ 100 million, within the next six to twelve months. It is reasonably possible that a net reduction within the range of $ 100 million to $ 500 million of unrecognized tax benefits may occur over the next 12 months as a result of the revaluation of uncertain tax positions arising from the issuance of legislation, regulatory or other guidance or developments in examinations, in appeals, or in the courts, or the closure of tax statutes. NOTE 14: RESTRUCTURING COSTS Restructuring costs are generally expensed as incurred. All U.S. government unallowable restructuring costs related to the Raytheon Merger are recorded within Corporate expenses and other unallocated items, as these costs are not included in management’s evaluation of the segments’ performance, and as a result, there are no unallowable restructuring costs at the RIS and RMD segments. During 2021, we recorded net pre-tax restructuring costs totaling $ 143 million for new and ongoing restructuring actions. We recorded charges in the segments as follows: (dollars in millions) Pratt & Whitney $ 7 Collins Aerospace Systems 40 Corporate expenses and other unallocated items 96 Total $ 143 Restructuring charges incurred in 2021 primarily relate to actions initiated during 2021 and were recorded as follows: (dollars in millions) Cost of sales $ 34 Selling, general & administrative 109 Total $ 143 2021 Actions. During 2021, we recorded net pre-tax restructuring costs totaling $ 137 million for restructuring actions initiated in 2021, consisting of $ 97 million in Selling, general and administrative and $ 40 million in Cost of sales. The 2021 actions primarily consist of severance costs related to ongoing cost reduction efforts, and to a much lesser extent, the exit and consolidation of facilities. We are targeting to complete in 2022 the majority of the remaining cost reduction actions initiated in 2021. No specific plans for other significant actions have been finalized at this time. The following table summarizes our accrual balances for the 2021 restructuring actions, which is included in Other accrued liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet: (dollars in millions) Net pre-tax restructuring costs $ 137 Utilization, foreign exchange and other costs ( 50 ) Balance at December 31, 2021 $ 87 104 Table of Contents The following table summarizes expected, incurred and remaining costs for the 2021 restructuring actions by segment: (dollars in millions) Expected Costs Cost Incurred During 2021 Remaining Costs at December 31, 2021 Pratt & Whitney $ 60 $ ( 24 ) $ 36 Collins Aerospace Systems 62 ( 36 ) 26 Corporate expenses and other unallocated items 77 ( 77 ) — Total $ 199 $ ( 137 ) $ 62 2020 Actions. During 2021, we reversed net pre-tax restructuring costs totaling $ 23 million for restructuring actions initiated in 2020, consisting of a reversal of $ 14 million in Cost of sales and $ 9 million in Selling, general and administrative expenses. The 2020 actions primarily consist of severance costs principally related to restructuring actions at Pratt & Whitney and Collins Aerospace in response to the impact on our operating results from the economic environment primarily caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, actions at Corporate related to the Raytheon Merger, and ongoing cost reduction efforts including workforce reductions, and to a lesser extent, consolidation of field operations. The following table summarizes the accrual balance for the 2020 restructuring actions for the year ended 2021, which is included in Other accrued liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet: (dollars in millions) Restructuring accruals at January 1, 2021 $ 340 Net pre-tax restructuring costs ( 23 ) Utilization, foreign exchange and other costs ( 267 ) Balance at December 31, 2021 $ 50 The following table summarizes expected, incurred and remaining costs for the 2020 programs by segment: (dollars in millions) Expected Costs Costs Incurred During 2020 Costs (Incurred) Reversed During 2021 Remaining Costs at December 31, 2021 Pratt & Whitney $ 188 $ ( 205 ) $ 17 $ — Collins Aerospace Systems 312 ( 333 ) 25 4 Corporate expenses and other unallocated items 251 ( 232 ) ( 19 ) — Total $ 751 $ ( 770 ) $ 23 $ 4 2019 and Prior Actions. During 2021, we recorded net pre-tax restructuring costs totaling $ 29 million for restructuring actions initiated in 2019 and prior. As of December 31, 2021, we had $ 25 million of accrual balances remaining related to 2019 and prior actions. NOTE 15: FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS We enter into derivative instruments primarily for risk management purposes, including derivatives designated as hedging instruments and those utilized as economic hedges. We operate internationally and in the normal course of business, are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. These fluctuations can increase the costs of financing, investing and operating the business. We have used derivative instruments, including swaps, forward contracts and options to manage certain foreign currency, interest rate and commodity price exposures. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency hedges was $ 8.5 billion and $ 11.6 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Additional information pertaining to foreign exchange and hedging activities is included in “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles.” 105 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the fair value and presentation in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for derivative instruments as of December 31: (dollars in millions) Balance Sheet Location 2021 2020 Derivatives designated as hedging instruments: Foreign exchange contracts Other assets, current $ 59 $ 197 Other accrued liabilities 202 66 Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Foreign exchange contracts Other assets, current $ 11 $ 44 Other accrued liabilities 11 32 The effect of cash flow hedging relationships on Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and on the Consolidated Statement of Operations in 2021 and 2020 are presented in the table below. The amounts of gain or (loss) are attributable to foreign exchange contract activity and are primarily recorded as a component of Products sales when reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive loss. (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Gain (loss) recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss $ ( 226 ) $ 181 $ ( 33 ) (Gain) loss reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive loss ( 28 ) 82 51 The Company utilizes the critical terms match method in assessing derivatives for hedge effectiveness. Accordingly, the hedged items and derivatives designated as hedging instruments are highly effective. As of December 31, 2021, we have € 500 million of euro-denominated long-term debt outstanding, which qualifies as a net investment hedge against our investments in European businesses, which is deemed to be effective. Assuming current market conditions continue, a $ 28 million pre-tax loss is expected to be reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive loss into Products sales to reflect the fixed prices obtained from foreign exchange hedging within the next 12 months. At December 31, 2021, all derivative contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges will mature b y January 2028. The effect of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments within Other income, net, on the Consolidated Statement of Operations was as follows: (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Gain (loss) on non-designated foreign exchange contracts $ ( 24 ) $ ( 76 ) $ 91 NOTE 16: FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The following tables provide the valuation hierarchy classification of assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value and measured on a recurring basis in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2021 and 2020: December 31, 2021 (dollars in millions) Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Recurring fair value measurements: Marketable securities held in trusts $ 965 $ 890 $ 75 $ — Derivative assets 70 — 70 — Derivative liabilities ( 213 ) — ( 213 ) — December 31, 2020 (dollars in millions) Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Recurring fair value measurements: Marketable securities held in trusts $ 881 $ 773 $ 108 $ — Derivative assets 241 — 241 — Derivative liabilities ( 98 ) — ( 98 ) — 106 Table of Contents Valuation Techniques. Our derivative assets and liabilities include foreign exchange contracts that are measured at fair value using internal models based on observable market inputs such as forward rates, interest rates, our own credit risk and our counterparties’ credit risks. As of December 31, 2021, there has not been any significant impact to the fair value of our derivative liabilities due to our own credit risk. Similarly, there has not been any significant adverse impact to our derivative assets based on our evaluation of our counterparties’ credit risks. The following table provides carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments that are not carried at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31: 2021 2020 (dollars in millions) Carrying Amount Fair Value Carrying Amount Fair Value Customer financing notes receivables $ 195 $ 192 $ 271 $ 264 Long-term debt (excluding finance leases) ( 31,250 ) ( 35,828 ) ( 31,512 ) ( 38,615 ) The following table provides the valuation hierarchy classification of assets and liabilities that are not carried at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2021 and 2020: December 31, 2021 (dollars in millions) Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Customer financing notes receivables $ 192 $ — $ 192 $ — Long-term debt (excluding finance leases) ( 35,828 ) — ( 35,778 ) ( 50 ) December 31, 2020 (dollars in millions) Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Customer financing notes receivables $ 264 $ — $ 264 $ — Long-term debt (excluding finance leases) ( 38,615 ) — ( 38,540 ) ( 75 ) The fair value of our Short-term borrowings approximates the carrying value due to their short-term nature, with commercial paper classified as level 2 and other short-term borrowings classified as level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. NOTE 17: VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES Pratt & Whitney holds a 61 % program share interest in the International Aero Engines AG (IAE) collaboration with MTU Aero Engines AG (MTU) and Japanese Aero Engines Corporation (JAEC) and a 49.5 % ownership interest in IAE. IAE’s business purpose is to coordinate the design, development, manufacturing and product support of the V2500 engine program through involvement with the collaborators. Additionally, Pratt & Whitney, JAEC and MTU are participants in International Aero Engines, LLC (IAE LLC), whose business purpose is to coordinate the design, development, manufacturing and product support for the PW1100G-JM engine for the Airbus A320neo aircraft and the PW1400G-JM engine for the Irkut MC-21 aircraft. Pratt & Whitney holds a 59 % program share interest and a 59 % ownership interest in IAE LLC. IAE and IAE LLC retain limited equity with the primary economics of the programs passed to the participants. As such, we have determined that IAE and IAE LLC are variable interest entities with Pratt & Whitney as the primary beneficiary. IAE and IAE LLC have, therefore, been consolidated. The carrying amounts and classification of assets and liabilities for variable interest entities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 are as follows: (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 Current assets $ 7,081 $ 6,652 Noncurrent assets 825 868 Total assets $ 7,906 $ 7,520 Current liabilities $ 7,965 $ 7,365 Noncurrent liabilities 54 89 Total liabilities $ 8,019 $ 7,454 107 Table of Contents NOTE 18: GUARANTEES We extend a variety of financial, market value and product performance guarantees to third parties. These instruments expire on various dates through 2028. Additional guarantees of project performance for which there is no stated value also remain outstanding. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the following financial guarantees were outstanding: December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 (dollars in millions) Maximum Potential Payment Carrying Amount of Liability Maximum Potential Payment Carrying Amount of Liability Commercial aerospace financing guarantees $ 309 $ 3 $ 322 $ 6 Third party guarantees 511 5 386 3 We have made residual value and other guarantees related to various commercial aerospace customer financing arrangements. The estimated fair market values of the guaranteed assets equal or exceed the value of the related guarantees, net of existing reserves. Collaboration partners’ share of these financing guarantees is $ 141 million and $ 142 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We also have obligations arising from sales of certain businesses and assets, including those from representations and warranties and related indemnities for environmental, health and safety, tax and employment matters. The maximum potential payment related to these obligations is not a specified amount as a number of the obligations do not contain financial caps. The carrying amount of liabilities related to these obligations was $ 120 million at both December 31, 2021 and 2020. For additional information regarding the environmental indemnifications, see “Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies.” We accrue for costs associated with guarantees when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of currently available facts, and where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, the minimum is accrued. We also provide service and warranty policies on our products and extend performance and operating cost guarantees beyond our normal service and warranty policies on some of our products, particularly commercial aircraft engines. In addition, we incur discretionary costs to service our products in connection with specific product performance issues. Liabilities for performance and operating cost guarantees are based upon future product performance and durability, and are largely estimated based upon historical experience. Adjustments are made to accruals as claims data and historical experience warrant. The changes in the carrying amount of service and product warranties and product performance guarantees for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows: (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 Balance as of January 1 $ 1,057 $ 1,033 Warranties and performance guarantees issued 380 311 Settlements ( 272 ) ( 292 ) Other ( 8 ) 5 Balance as of December 31 $ 1,157 $ 1,057 NOTE 19: COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Except as otherwise noted, while we are unable to predict the final outcome, based on information currently available, we do not believe that resolution of any of the following matters will have a material adverse effect upon our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Environmental. Our operations are subject to environmental regulation by federal, state and local authorities in the United States and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our foreign operations. We have accrued for the costs of environmental remediation activities, including but not limited to investigatory, remediation, operating and maintenance costs and performance guarantees, and periodically reassess these amounts. We do not expect any additional liability to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had $ 834 million and $ 835 million, respectively, reserved for environmental remediation. Additional information pertaining to environmental matters is included in “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles.” Commercial Aerospace Financing and Other Commitments. We had commercial aerospace financing commitments and other contractual commitments of approximately $ 15.6 billion and $ 13.4 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, on a gross basis before reduction for our collaboration partners’ share. Aircraft financing commitments, in the 108 Table of Contents form of debt or lease financing, are provided to certain commercial aerospace customers. The extent to which the financing commitments will be utilized is not currently known, since customers may be able to obtain more favorable terms from other financing sources. We may also arrange for third-party investors to assume a portion of these commitments. The majority of financing commitments are collateralized arrangements. We may also lease aircraft and subsequently sublease the aircraft to customers under long-term non-cancelable operating leases, or pay deposits on behalf of our customers to secure production slots with the airframers (pre-delivery payments). Our financing commitments with customers are contingent upon maintenance of certain levels of financial condition by the customers. Associated risks on these commitments are mitigated due to the fact that interest rates are variable during the commitment term and are set at the date of funding based on current market conditions, the fair value of the underlying collateral and the credit worthiness of the customers. As a result, the fair value of these financing commitments is expected to equal the amounts funded. We also have other contractual commitments, including commitments to make payments to secure certain contractual rights to provide product on new aircraft platforms. The estimated amount and timing of these payments, which are generally based on future sales or engine flight hours, are reflected in “Other commercial aerospace commitments” in the table below. Payments made on these contractual commitments are included within intangible assets as exclusivity assets and are amortized over the term of underlying economic benefit. We have entered into certain collaboration arrangements, which may include participation by our collaboration partners in these commitments. In addition, in connection with our 2012 agreement to acquire Rolls-Royce’s ownership and collaboration interests in IAE, additional payments are due to Rolls-Royce contingent upon each hour flown through June 2027 by the V2500-powered aircraft in service as of the acquisition date. These flight hour payments, which are considered in “Other commercial aerospace commitments” below, will be capitalized as collaboration intangible assets as payments are made. The following is the expected maturity of our commercial aerospace industry commitments as of December 31, 2021: (dollars in millions) Committed 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Thereafter Commercial aerospace financing commitments $ 4,552 $ 1,222 $ 1,051 $ 1,380 $ 344 $ 443 $ 112 Other commercial aerospace commitments 11,014 735 1,053 765 739 597 7,125 Collaboration partners’ share ( 5,907 ) ( 665 ) ( 659 ) ( 814 ) ( 423 ) ( 444 ) ( 2,902 ) Total commercial aerospace commitments $ 9,659 $ 1,292 $ 1,445 $ 1,331 $ 660 $ 596 $ 4,335 Other Financing Arrangements. We have entered into standby letters of credit and surety bonds with financial institutions to meet various bid, performance, warranty, retention and advance payment obligations for us or our affiliates. We enter into these agreements to assist certain affiliates in obtaining financing on more favorable terms, making bids on contracts and performing their contractual obligations. The stated values of these letters of credit agreements and surety bonds totaled $ 3.9 billion as of December 31, 2021. Offset Obligations. We have entered into industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes in the form of either offset agreements or ICIP agreements, as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services from certain customers in foreign countries. At December 31, 2021, the aggregate amount of our offset agreements, both agreed to and anticipated to be agreed to, had an outstanding notional value of approximately $ 10.3 billion. These agreements are designed to return economic value to the foreign country by requiring us to engage in activities supporting local defense or commercial industries, promoting a balance of trade, developing in-country technology capabilities or addressing other local development priorities. Offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require a direct cash payment, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing, training and other consulting support to in-country projects, and the purchase by third parties (e.g., our vendors) of supplies from in-country vendors. These agreements may also be satisfied through our use of cash for activities such as subcontracting with local partners, purchasing supplies from in-country vendors, providing financial support for in-country projects and making investments in local ventures. Such activities may also vary by country depending upon requirements as dictated by their governments. We typically do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive. The amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customers and typically require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the notional value in the offset agreements. Offset programs usually extend over several or more years and may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirements. Historically, we have not been required to pay any penalties of significance. Government Oversight . In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries and our properties are subject to regulatory and governmental examinations, information gathering requests, inquiries, investigations and threatened legal actions and proceedings. For example, we are now, and believe that, in light of the current U.S. government contracting environment, 109 Table of Contents we will continue to be the subject of one or more U.S. government investigations. Our contracts with the U.S. government are also subject to audits. Agencies that oversee contract performance include: the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA), the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), the Inspectors General of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and other departments and agencies, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the Department of Justice (DOJ), and Congressional Committees. Other areas of our business operations may also be subject to audit and investigation by these and other agencies. From time to time, agencies investigate or conduct audits to determine whether our operations are being conducted in accordance with applicable requirements. Such investigations and audits may be initiated due to a number of reasons, including as a result of a whistleblower complaint. Such investigations and audits could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, including repayments, fines, treble or other damages, forfeitures, restitution, or penalties being imposed upon us, the suspension of government export licenses or the suspension or debarment from future U.S. government contracting. U.S. government investigations often take years to complete. The U.S. government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent, criminal or other seriously improper conduct. The U.S. government could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud. Like many defense contractors, we have received audit reports recommending the reduction of certain contract prices because, for example, cost or pricing data or cost accounting practices used to price and negotiate those contracts may not have conformed to government regulations. Some of these audit reports recommend that certain payments be repaid, delayed, or withheld, and may involve substantial amounts. We have made voluntary refunds in those cases we believe appropriate, have settled some allegations and, in some cases, continue to negotiate and/or litigate. The Company may be, and in some cases has been, required to make payments into escrow of disputed liabilities while the related litigation is pending. If the litigation is resolved in the Company’s favor, any such payments will be returned to the Company with interest. Our final allowable incurred costs for each year are also subject to audit and have, from time to time, resulted in disputes between us and the U.S. government, with litigation resulting at the Court of Federal Claims (COFC) or the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (ASBCA) or their related courts of appeals. In addition, the DOJ has, from time to time, convened grand juries to investigate possible irregularities by us. We also provide products and services to customers outside of the U.S., and those sales are subject to local government laws, regulations and procurement policies and practices. Our compliance with such local government regulations or any applicable U.S. government regulations (e.g., the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)) may also be investigated or audited. In addition, we accrue for liabilities associated with those matters that are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The most likely liability amount to be incurred is accrued based upon a range of estimates. Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, then we accrue the minimum amount. Other than as specifically disclosed in this Form 10-K, we do not expect these audits, investigations or disputes to have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity, either individually or in the aggregate. Legal Proceedings. The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to various contract pricing disputes, government investigations and litigation matters across jurisdictions, updates to certain of which are set forth below. Cost Accounting Standards Claims As previously disclosed, in April 2019, a Divisional Administrative Contracting Officer (DACO) of the United States DCMA asserted a claim against Pratt & Whitney to recover alleged overpayments of approximately $ 1.73 billion plus interest ($ 730 million at December 31, 2021). The claim is based on Pratt & Whitney’s alleged noncompliance with Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) from January 1, 2007 to March 31, 2019, due to its method of allocating independent research and development costs to government contracts. Pratt & Whitney believes that the claim is without merit and filed an appeal to the ASBCA on June 7, 2019. As previously disclosed, in December 2013, a DCMA DACO asserted a claim against Pratt & Whitney to recover alleged overpayments of approximately $ 177 million plus interest ($ 118 million at December 31, 2021). The claim is based on Pratt & Whitney’s alleged noncompliance with CAS from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2012, due to its method of determining the cost of collaborator parts used in the calculation of material overhead costs for government contracts. In 2014, Pratt & Whitney filed an appeal to the ASBCA. An evidentiary hearing was held and completed in June 2019. On November 22, 2021, the ASBCA issued its written decision sustaining in part and denying in part Pratt & Whitney’s appeal. The ASBCA rejected the DCMA’s asserted measure of the cost of collaborator parts, and ruled substantially in Pratt & Whitney’s favor on other liability issues. The ASBCA remanded the appeal to the parties for resolution of damages issues, which could require further proceedings at the ASBCA. On December 23, 2021, the DCMA filed a motion with the ASBCA seeking partial reconsideration of the November 22, 2021 decision. Although the ASBCA decision may also be subject to further appellate review, we believe that the ASBCA’s rejection of the DCMA’s asserted measure of the cost of collaborator parts is well supported in fact and law and likely will be sustained. In December 2018, a DCMA DACO issued a second claim against Pratt & Whitney that similarly alleges that its method of determining the cost of collaborator parts does not comply with the CAS for calendar years 2013 through 2017. This second claim, which asserts the same measure of the cost of collaborator parts rejected by the ASBCA’s recent decision, demands payment of $ 269 million plus interest ($ 80 million at December 31, 2021). Pratt & Whitney appealed 110 Table of Contents this second claim to the ASBCA in January 2019. Although subject to further litigation at the ASBCA and potentially further appellate proceedings, we believe that the November 22, 2021 decision in the first claim will apply with equal legal effect to the second claim. Accordingly, we believe that the amounts demanded by the DCMA as set forth in the two claims are without legal basis and that any damages owed to the U.S. government for the two claims will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Thales-Raytheon Systems Matter As previously disclosed, in 2019, Raytheon Company received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seeking information in connection with an investigation into whether there were improper payments made by Thales-Raytheon Systems (TRS) or anyone acting on their behalf in connection with TRS or Raytheon Company contracts in certain Middle East countries since 2014. In the first quarter of 2020, the DOJ advised Raytheon Company it had opened a parallel criminal investigation. In the third quarter of 2020, Raytheon Company received an additional subpoena from the SEC, seeking information and documents as part of its ongoing investigation. The Company maintains a rigorous anti-corruption compliance program, is cooperating fully with the SEC’s and DOJ’s inquiry, and is examining whether there has been any conduct that is in violation of Raytheon Company policy. At this time, the Company is unable to predict the outcome of the SEC’s or DOJ’s inquiry. Based on the information available to date, however, we do not believe the results of this inquiry will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. DOJ Investigation, Contract Pricing Disputes and Related Civil Litigation As previously disclosed, on October 8, 2020, the Company received a criminal subpoena from the DOJ seeking information and documents in connection with an investigation relating to financial accounting, internal controls over financial reporting, and cost reporting regarding Raytheon Company’s Missiles & Defense (RMD) business since 2009. The investigation involves multi-year contracts subject to governmental regulation, including potential civil defective pricing claims for three RMD contracts entered into between 2011 and 2013. As part of the same investigation, on March 24, 2021, the Company received a second criminal subpoena from the DOJ seeking documents relating to a different RMD contract entered into in 2017. We are cooperating fully with, and will continue to review the issues raised by, the DOJ’s ongoing investigation. We have made substantial progress in our internal review of the issues raised by the DOJ investigation. Although we continue to believe we have defenses to the potential claims, the Company has determined that there is a probable risk of liability for damages, interest and potential penalties and has accrued approximately $ 290 million for this matter. We are currently unable to estimate an incremental loss, if any, which may result following the completion of our internal review and resolution of the DOJ investigation. Based on the information available to date, we do not believe the results of the investigation or of any potential civil litigation will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Four shareholder lawsuits were filed against the Company after the DOJ investigation was first disclosed. A putative securities class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona against the Company and certain of its executives alleging that the defendants violated federal securities laws by making material misstatements in regulatory filings regarding internal controls over financial reporting in RMD. Three shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against the former Raytheon Company Board of Directors, the Company and certain of its executives, each alleging that defendants violated federal securities laws and breached their fiduciary duties by engaging in improper accounting practices, failing to implement sufficient internal financial and compliance controls, and making a series of false and misleading statements in regulatory filings. We believe that each of these lawsuits lacks merit. Darnis, et al. As previously disclosed, on August 12, 2020, several former employees of UTC or its subsidiaries filed a putative class action complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut against the Company, Otis, Carrier, the former members of the UTC Board of Directors, and the members of the Carrier and Otis Boards of Directors (Geraud Darnis, et al. v. Raytheon Technologies Corporation, et al.). The complaint challenged the method by which UTC equity awards were converted to Company, Otis, and Carrier equity awards following the separation of UTC into three independent, publicly-traded companies on April 3, 2020. The complaint also claimed that the defendants are liable for breach of certain equity compensation plans and also asserted claims under certain provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). On September 13, 2021, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint which supersedes the initial complaint and continues to assert claims for breach of the equity compensation plans against the Company, Otis and Carrier, but no longer asserts ERISA claims. Further, no claim is made in the amended complaint against any current or former director of any of the three companies. Plaintiffs seek money damages, attorneys’ fees and other relief. We continue to believe that the Company has meritorious defenses to these claims. At this time, the Company is unable to predict the outcome; however, based on the 111 Table of Contents information available to date, we do not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. DOJ Grand Jury Investigation and Related Civil Litigation The Company received a grand jury subpoena in late 2019, as part of a DOJ criminal investigation into purported agreements not to solicit or hire employees in violation of the federal antitrust laws. While the investigation has focused on alleged hiring restrictions between and among Pratt & Whitney and certain of its suppliers of outsourced engineering services, the subpoena also included requests regarding Collins Aerospace. Since receipt of the subpoena, the Company has been cooperating with the DOJ investigation. On December 15, 2021, a criminal indictment was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, against a former Pratt & Whitney employee and other employees of certain outsourced engineering suppliers charging each of them with one count of violating the federal antitrust laws. No current or former Collins Aerospace employees were named in the indictment. We were recently advised that the Company is a target of the DOJ investigation, and we continue to cooperate with the investigation. No criminal charge has been filed against the Company or its affiliates. After the criminal charges against the individuals were filed, numerous civil class action antitrust lawsuits have been filed against Pratt & Whitney and other corporate and individual defendants in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut. The allegations in each of the civil lawsuits track the factual assertions in the criminal indictment and generally allege that Pratt & Whitney and the other defendants agreed to restrict the hiring and recruiting of certain engineers and skilled laborers in a manner that violated federal antitrust laws. Plaintiffs in each of the civil lawsuits seek to represent different purported classes of engineers and skilled laborers employed by Pratt & Whitney and other supplier-defendants since 2011. Collins Aerospace was also named as a defendant in some of the lawsuits. Plaintiffs in each of the lawsuits seek treble damages in an undetermined amount, plus attorneys’ fees and costs of suit. We expect that all the lawsuits ultimately will be consolidated into a single joint complaint. We believe that each of these lawsuits lacks merit. Based on the information available to date, we do not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Where appropriate, we have recorded loss contingency accruals for the above-referenced matters, and the amounts individually, or in the aggregate, are not material. Other. As described in “Note 18: Guarantees,” we extend performance and operating cost guarantees beyond our normal warranty and service policies for extended periods on some of our products. We have accrued our estimate of the liability that may result under these guarantees and for service costs that are probable and can be reasonably estimated. We also have other commitments and contingent liabilities related to legal proceedings, self-insurance programs and matters arising out of the normal course of business. We accrue contingencies based upon a range of possible outcomes. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other, then we accrue the minimum amount. In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are also routinely defendants in, parties to or otherwise subject to many pending and threatened legal actions, claims, disputes and proceedings. These matters are often based on alleged violations of contract, product liability, warranty, regulatory, environmental, health and safety, employment, intellectual property, tax and other laws. In some instances, claims for substantial monetary damages are asserted against the Company and its subsidiaries and could result in fines, penalties, compensatory or treble damages or non-monetary relief. We do not believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. 112 Table of Contents NOTE 20: ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME A summary of the changes in each component of Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, net of tax is provided below: (dollars in millions) Foreign Currency Translation Defined Benefit Pension and Postretirement Plans Unrealized Hedging (Losses) Gains Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income Balance at December 31, 2018 $ ( 3,442 ) $ ( 5,718 ) $ ( 173 ) $ ( 9,333 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications, net 280 ( 584 ) ( 33 ) ( 337 ) Amounts reclassified, pre-tax 2 170 51 223 Tax benefit (expense) ( 43 ) 97 ( 11 ) 43 ASU 2018-02 adoption impact ( 8 ) ( 737 ) — ( 745 ) Balance at December 31, 2019 $ ( 3,211 ) $ ( 6,772 ) $ ( 166 ) $ ( 10,149 ) Other comprehensive income before reclassifications, net 609 1,842 181 2,632 Amounts reclassified, pre-tax — 373 82 455 Tax benefit (expense) 25 ( 510 ) ( 62 ) ( 547 ) Separation of Carrier and Otis, net of tax 3,287 584 4 3,875 Balance at December 31, 2020 $ 710 $ ( 4,483 ) $ 39 $ ( 3,734 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications, net ( 647 ) 3,210 ( 226 ) 2,337 Amounts reclassified, pre-tax — 258 ( 28 ) 230 Tax benefit (expense) ( 14 ) ( 813 ) 79 ( 748 ) Balance at December 31, 2021 $ 49 $ ( 1,828 ) $ ( 136 ) $ ( 1,915 ) In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Topic 220) . The standard allows companies to reclassify to retained earnings the stranded tax effects in Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA). We elected to reclassify the income tax effects of TCJA from AOCI of $ 745 million to retained earnings, effective January 1, 2019. Amounts reclassified that relate to our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans include the amortization of prior service costs and actuarial net gains or losses recognized during each period presented. These costs are recorded as components of net periodic pension income for each period presented. See “Note 11: Employee Benefit Plans” for additional details. All noncontrolling interests with redemption features, such as put options, that are not solely within our control (redeemable noncontrolling interests) are reported in the mezzanine section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet, between liabilities and equity, at the greater of redemption value or initial carrying value. NOTE 21: STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION RTC’s long-term incentive plans authorize various types of market and performance based incentive awards that may be granted to officers and key employees. Certain historic awards remain outstanding under predecessor plans. The Raytheon Technologies Corporation 2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (2018 LTIP) was approved by shareowners on April 26, 2021. A total of 134.8 million shares have been authorized for issuance pursuant to awards under the 2018 LTIP including shares assumed from predecessor plans. There is also an additional 21.5 million shares for future issuance due to adjustments related to the Separation Transactions. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 99.2 million shares remain available for awards under the 2018 LTIP. The 2018 LTIP does not contain aggregate annual award limits, however, it sets an annual award limit per participant. The 2018 LTIP will expire after all authorized shares have been awarded or April 26, 2031, whichever is sooner. Under the 2018 LTIP, the exercise price of awards is set on the grant date and may not be less than the fair market value per share on that date. Generally, stock appreciation rights and stock options have a term of ten years and a three-year vesting period, subject to limited exceptions. In the event of retirement, annual stock appreciation rights, stock options, and RSUs held for more than one year may become vested and exercisable, subject to certain terms and conditions. LTIP awards with performance-based vesting generally have a minimum three-year vesting period and vest based on actual performance against pre-established metrics. In the event of retirement, performance-based awards held for more than one year, remain eligible to vest based on actual performance relative to performance goals. We have historically repurchased shares of our common stock 113 Table of Contents in an amount at least equal to the number of shares issued under our equity compensation arrangements and will continue to evaluate this policy in conjunction with our overall share repurchase program. We measure the cost of all share-based payments, including stock options and stock appreciation rights, at fair value on the grant date and recognize this cost in the Consolidated Statement of Operations, net of expected forfeitures, as follows: (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Total compensation cost recognized $ 442 $ 330 $ 268 The associated future income tax benefit recognized was $ 83 million, $ 63 million and $ 47 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the amount of cash received from the exercise of stock options was $ 7 million, $ 15 million and $ 27 million, respectively, with an associated tax benefit realized of $ 42 million, $ 48 million and $ 75 million, respectively. In addition, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the associated tax benefit realized from the vesting of performance share units (PSUs), restricted stock awards and RSUs was $ 44 million, $ 58 million and $ 36 million, respectively. At December 31, 2021, there was $ 328 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested equity awards granted under long-term incentive plans. This cost is expected to be recognized ratably over a weighted-average period of 2.4 years. A summary of the transactions under our long-term incentive plans for the year ended December 31, 2021 follows. Stock Options Stock Appreciation Rights Performance Share Units Restricted Stock and RSUs (shares and units in thousands) Shares Average Price (1) Shares Average Price (1) Units Average Price (1) Units Average Price (1) Outstanding at: December 31, 2020 1,944 $ 77.88 33,550 $ 77.93 — $ — 11,034 $ 62.92 Granted 64 72.49 2,371 73.07 1,339 73.75 4,426 73.28 Exercised / earned ( 109 ) 61.85 ( 2,291 ) 61.90 — — ( 3,431 ) 64.77 Cancelled ( 50 ) 88.01 ( 569 ) 81.90 ( 74 ) 73.65 ( 586 ) 65.44 December 31, 2021 1,849 $ 78.36 33,061 $ 78.62 1,265 $ 73.75 11,443 $ 66.18 (1) Weighted-average grant / exercise price. The weighted-average grant date fair value of stock options and stock appreciation rights granted during 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $ 15.60 , $ 23.37 and $ 20.81 , respectively. The weighted-average grant date fair value of performance share units, which vest upon achieving certain performance metrics, granted during 2021 and 2019 was $ 73.75 and $ 117.87 , respectively. There were no performance share units granted in 2020, and all PSUs granted in 2019 were converted to RSUs in connection with the Separation Transactions and Distributions. The total fair value of awards vested during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $ 287 million, $ 284 million and $ 211 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value (which is the amount by which the stock price exceeded the exercise price on the date of exercise) of stock options and stock appreciation rights exercised during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $ 54 million, $ 206 million and $ 383 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value (which is the stock price at vesting multiplied by the number of underlying shares) of performance share units and other restricted awards vested was $ 256 million, $ 295 million and $ 188 million during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The following table summarizes information about equity awards outstanding that are vested and expected to vest as well as equity awards outstanding that are exercisable at December 31, 2021: Equity Awards Vested and Expected to Vest Equity Awards That Are Exercisable (shares in thousands; aggregate intrinsic value in millions) Awards Average Price (1) Aggregate Intrinsic Value Remaining Term (2) Awards Average Price (1) Aggregate Intrinsic Value Remaining Term (2) Stock Options 1,841 $ 78.33 $ 8 7.71 1,029 $ 76.04 $ 11 4.30 Stock Appreciation Rights 32,860 78.60 155 7.82 19,276 77.34 176 4.46 Performance Share Units 1,127 73.76 97 2.11 Restricted Stock and RSUs 10,660 66.29 1,174 1.61 (1) Weighted-average exercise price per share.

The following table indicates the assumptions used in estimating fair value for awards granted during 2021, 2020 and 2019. Lattice-based option models incorporate ranges of assumptions for inputs; those ranges are as follows: 2021 2020 2019 Expected volatility 29.9 % 18.8 % 18.8 % - 19.7 % Weighted-average volatility 30 % 19 % 20 % Expected term (in years) 6.5 6.5 6.5 - 6.6 Expected dividend yield 2.6 % 1.9 % 2.4 % Risk-free rate 0.04 % - 1.2 % 1.4 % - 1.6 % 2.3 % - 2.7 % Expected volatilities are based on the returns of our stock, including implied volatilities from traded options on our stock for the binomial lattice model. We use historical data to estimate equity award exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model. The expected term represents an estimate of the period of time equity awards are expected to remain outstanding. The risk-free rate is based on the term structure of interest rates at the time of equity award grant.

Total sales and operating profit by segment include inter-segment sales which are generally recorded at cost-plus a specified fee or at a negotiated fixed price. These pricing arrangements may result in margins different than what the purchasing segment realizes on the ultimate third-party sales. We present a FAS/CAS operating adjustment outside of segment results, which represents the difference between the service cost component of our pension and PRB expense under the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) requirements of U.S. GAAP and our pension and PRB expense under U.S. government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) primarily related to our RIS and RMD segments. While the ultimate liability for pension and PRB costs under FAS and CAS is similar, the pattern of cost recognition is different. Over time, we generally expect to recover the related RIS and RMD pension and PRB liabilities through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government. Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney segments generally record pension and PRB expense on a FAS basis. Acquisition accounting adjustments include the amortization of acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions, the amortization of the property, plant and equipment fair value adjustment acquired through acquisitions and the amortization of customer contractual obligations related to loss making or below market contracts acquired. These adjustments are not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment results. As previously announced, effective January 1, 2021, we reorganized certain product areas of our RIS and RMD businesses to more efficiently leverage our capabilities. The amounts and presentation of our business segments, including intersegment activity, set forth in this Form 10-K reflect this reorganization. The reorganization does not impact our previously reported Collins Aerospace Systems and Pratt & Whitney segment results, or our consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations or statements of cash flows. Segment information for the years ended December 31 are as follows: Net Sales Operating Profit (Loss) Operating Profit (Loss) Margins (dollars in millions) 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 2019 Collins Aerospace Systems $ 18,449 $ 19,288 $ 26,028 $ 1,759 $ 1,466 $ 4,508 9.5 % 7.6 % 17.3 % Pratt & Whitney 18,150 16,799 20,902 454 ( 564 ) 1,801 2.5 % ( 3.4 ) % 8.6 % Raytheon Intelligence & Space 15,180 11,069 — 1,833 1,020 — 12.1 % 9.2 % — % Raytheon Missiles & Defense 15,539 11,396 — 2,004 880 — 12.9 % 7.7 % — % Total segment 67,318 58,552 46,930 6,050 2,802 6,309 9.0 % 4.8 % 13.4 % Eliminations and other (1) ( 2,930 ) ( 1,965 ) ( 1,581 ) ( 133 ) ( 107 ) ( 140 ) Corporate expenses and other unallocated items (2) — — — ( 552 ) ( 590 ) ( 367 ) FAS/CAS operating adjustment — — — 1,796 1,106 — Acquisition accounting adjustments (3) — — — ( 2,203 ) ( 5,100 ) ( 888 ) Consolidated $ 64,388 $ 56,587 $ 45,349 $ 4,958 $ ( 1,889 ) $ 4,914 7.7 % ( 3.3 ) % 10.8 % (1) Includes the operating results of certain smaller non-reportable business segments. 2020 amounts include Forcepoint, LLC, which was acquired as part of the Raytheon Merger, and subsequently disposed of on January 8, 2021.

We also disaggregate our contracts from customers by geographic location based on customer location, by customer and by sales type. Our geographic location based on customer location uses end user customer location where known or practical to determine, or in instances where the end user customer is not known or not practical to determine, we utilize “ship to” location as the customer location. In addition, for our RIS and RMD segments, we disaggregate our contracts from customers by contract type. We believe these categories best depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. 117 Table of Contents Segment sales disaggregated by geographic region for the years ended December 31 are as follows: 2021 (dollars in millions) Collins Aerospace Systems Pratt & Whitney Raytheon Intelligence & Space Raytheon Missiles & Defense Other Total United States $ 9,341 $ 9,034 $ 12,126 $ 9,495 $ 15 $ 40,011 Europe 4,421 3,488 434 1,255 — 9,598 Asia Pacific 1,851 3,885 771 1,462 — 7,969 Middle East and North Africa 462 441 469 3,007 — 4,379 Canada and All Other 915 1,302 144 70 — 2,431 Consolidated net sales 16,990 18,150 13,944 15,289 15 64,388 Inter-segment sales 1,459 — 1,236 250 ( 2,945 ) — Business segment sales $ 18,449 $ 18,150 $ 15,180 $ 15,539 $ ( 2,930 ) $ 64,388 2020 (dollars in millions) Collins Aerospace Systems Pratt & Whitney Raytheon Intelligence & Space Raytheon Missiles & Defense Other Total United States $ 10,132 $ 8,534 $ 8,704 $ 6,906 $ 284 $ 34,560 Europe 4,643 2,726 307 1,031 149 8,856 Asia Pacific 1,810 4,024 637 1,132 41 7,644 Middle East and North Africa 421 505 410 2,077 30 3,443 Canada and All Other 904 1,001 83 73 23 2,084 Consolidated net sales 17,910 16,790 10,141 11,219 527 56,587 Inter-segment sales 1,378 9 928 177 ( 2,492 ) — Business segment sales $ 19,288 $ 16,799 $ 11,069 $ 11,396 $ ( 1,965 ) $ 56,587 2019 (dollars in millions) Collins Aerospace Systems Pratt & Whitney Raytheon Intelligence & Space Raytheon Missiles & Defense Other Total United States $ 12,762 $ 8,622 $ — $ — $ 13 $ 21,397 Europe 7,051 4,327 — — — 11,378 Asia Pacific 2,473 5,462 — — — 7,935 Middle East and North Africa 693 837 — — — 1,530 Canada and All Other 1,452 1,657 — — — 3,109 Consolidated net sales 24,431 20,905 — — 13 45,349 Inter-segment sales 1,597 ( 3 ) — — ( 1,594 ) — Business segment sales $ 26,028 $ 20,902 $ — $ — $ ( 1,581 ) $ 45,349 118 Table of Contents Segment sales disaggregated by customer for the years ended December 31 are as follows: 2021 (dollars in millions) Collins Aerospace Systems Pratt & Whitney Raytheon Intelligence & Space Raytheon Missiles & Defense Other Total U.S. government (1) $ 4,685 $ 5,140 $ 11,844 $ 9,493 $ 15 $ 31,177 Foreign military sales through the U.S. government 168 1,273 825 3,280 — 5,546 Foreign government direct commercial sales 1,095 541 844 2,513 — 4,993 Commercial aerospace and other commercial 11,042 11,196 431 3 — 22,672 Consolidated net sales 16,990 18,150 13,944 15,289 15 64,388 Inter-segment sales 1,459 — 1,236 250 ( 2,945 ) — Business segment sales $ 18,449 $ 18,150 $ 15,180 $ 15,539 $ ( 2,930 ) $ 64,388 (1) Excludes foreign military sales through the U.S. government. 2020 (dollars in millions) Collins Aerospace Systems Pratt & Whitney Raytheon Intelligence & Space Raytheon Missiles & Defense Other Total U.S. government (1) $ 5,159 $ 5,193 $ 8,512 $ 6,896 $ 202 $ 25,962 Foreign military sales through the U.S. government 218 1,229 640 2,498 — 4,585 Foreign government direct commercial sales 923 583 740 1,725 3 3,974 Commercial aerospace and other commercial 11,610 9,785 249 100 322 22,066 Consolidated net sales 17,910 16,790 10,141 11,219 527 56,587 Inter-segment sales 1,378 9 928 177 ( 2,492 ) — Business segment sales $ 19,288 $ 16,799 $ 11,069 $ 11,396 $ ( 1,965 ) $ 56,587 (1) Excludes foreign military sales through the U.S. government. 2019 (dollars in millions) Collins Aerospace Systems Pratt & Whitney Raytheon Intelligence & Space Raytheon Missiles & Defense Other Total U.S. government (1) $ 4,781 $ 4,313 $ — $ — $ — $ 9,094 Foreign military sales through the U.S. government 255 1,316 — — — 1,571 Foreign government direct commercial sales 937 561 — — — 1,498 Commercial aerospace and other commercial 18,458 14,715 — — 13 33,186 Consolidated net sales 24,431 20,905 — — 13 45,349 Inter-segment sales 1,597 ( 3 ) — — ( 1,594 ) — Business segment sales $ 26,028 $ 20,902 $ — $ — $ ( 1,581 ) $ 45,349 (1) Excludes foreign military sales through the U.S. government.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and the Corporate Vice President and Controller (Controller), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Based upon our evaluation, our CEO, CFO and Controller concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO, CFO and Controller, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Our management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in its 2013 Internal Control – Integrated Framework. Our management has concluded that based on its assessment, our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K . There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

BUSINESS General Raytheon Technologies Corporation is an aerospace and defense company that provides advanced systems and services for commercial, military and government customers worldwide. The terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “Raytheon Technologies,” “RTC” and the “Company” mean Raytheon Technologies Corporation, unless the context indicates another meaning. We serve commercial and government customers in both the original equipment and aftermarket parts and services segments of the aerospace industry. Our defense business serves both domestic and international customers as a prime contractor or subcontractor on a broad portfolio of defense and related programs for military and government customers. Formerly known as United Technologies Corporation (UTC), Raytheon Technologies was incorporated in Delaware in 1934 and represents the combination of UTC’s aerospace businesses and Raytheon Company through the Separation Transactions and Distributions and Raytheon Merger in April 2020, as described in more detail below. The following description of our business should be read in conjunction with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” within Item 7 of this Form 10-K, including the information contained therein under the heading “Business Overview.” Separation Transactions and Distributions. On April 3, 2020, UTC completed the separation of its business into three independent, publicly traded companies – UTC, Carrier Global Corporation (Carrier) and Otis Worldwide Corporation (Otis) (such separations, the “Separation Transactions”). UTC distributed all of the outstanding shares of Carrier common stock and all of the outstanding shares of Otis common stock to UTC shareowners who held shares of UTC common stock as of the close of business on March 19, 2020, the record date for the distributions (the “Distributions”) effective at 12:01 a.m., Eastern Time, on April 3, 2020. The historical results of Carrier and Otis are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Raytheon Merger. On April 3, 2020, following the completion of the Separation Transactions and the Distributions, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated June 9, 2019, as amended, UTC and Raytheon Company completed their all-stock merger of equals transaction (the “Raytheon Merger”). Upon closing of the Raytheon Merger, Raytheon Company became a wholly owned subsidiary of UTC, which changed its name to “Raytheon Technologies Corporation.” Business Segments Our operations are classified into four principal business segments: Collins Aerospace Systems, Pratt & Whitney, Raytheon Intelligence & Space and Raytheon Missiles & Defense, with each segment comprised of groups of similar operations. Collins Aerospace Systems.

Collins Aerospace’s product lines include integrated avionics systems, communications systems, navigation systems, electric power generation, management and distribution systems, environmental control systems, flight control systems, air data and aircraft sensing systems, engine control systems, engine nacelle systems, including thrust reversers and mounting pylons, interior and exterior aircraft lighting, aircraft seating and cargo systems, landing systems, including landing gear, wheels and braking systems, hoists and winches, fire and ice detection and protection systems, actuation systems, engine components, and propeller systems. Collins Aerospace also designs, produces and supports cabin interior, communications and aviation systems, oxygen systems, food and beverage preparation, storage and galley systems, lavatory and wastewater management systems. Collins Aerospace solutions support human space exploration with environmental control and power systems and extravehicular activity suits and support government and defense customer missions by providing airborne intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems, test and training range systems, crew escape systems, and simulation and training solutions. Collins Aerospace also provides information management services through worldwide voice and data communication networks and solutions. Aftermarket services include spare parts, overhaul and repair, engineering and technical support, training and fleet management solutions, and information management services. Collins Aerospace sells aerospace and defense products and services to aircraft manufacturers, airlines and other aircraft operators, the U.S. and foreign governments, defense contractors, maintenance, repair and overhaul providers, and independent distributors around the world. Collins Aerospace’s largest customers are Boeing and Airbus with combined sales, prior to discounts and incentives, of 21%, 27% and 31% of total Collins Aerospace segment sales in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In 2020, Collins Aerospace was awarded significant contracts for all four of the Future Vertical Lift (FVL) platforms, the Next Generation Ejection Seat (the ACES 5), Ground Based Strategic Deterrent, Bell H-1 Tail Drive System, the Next-Gen APU 4 Table of C ontents Fuel Nozzle, and the Mounted Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing System (MAPS GenII). Our products supported the first flight of the Boeing 777X, and enabled entry into service for the Embraer Praetor 500 and 600. Collins also delivered the first production Nacelle Enhancement Program (NEP) nacelle configuration on A350-900/1000. Significant product development activity continues, including major systems for Boeing’s T-7A and VC-25B, the Irkut MC-21, the Dassault Falcon 6X, the Leonardo AW249, the Xian MA700, and the COMAC C919. Other significant development work includes Iridium Next, high-frequency (HF) Next, 6th-gen military aircraft, Tactical Combat Training Systems Increment II, NASA deep space exploration systems, distributed pulse oxygen system, Confident to Fly technologies, and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) CLEEN II demonstrator. Pratt & Whitney. Pratt & Whitney is among the world’s leading suppliers of aircraft engines for commercial, military, business jet and general aviation customers. Pratt & Whitney’s Commercial Engines and Military Engines businesses design, develop, produce and maintain families of large engines for wide- and narrow-body and large regional aircraft for commercial customers and for fighter, bomber, tanker and transport aircraft for military customers. Pratt & Whitney’s small engine business, Pratt & Whitney Canada (P&WC), is among the world’s leading suppliers of engines powering regional airlines, general and business aviation, as well as helicopters. Pratt & Whitney also produces, sells and services military and commercial auxiliary power units. Pratt & Whitney provides fleet management services and aftermarket maintenance, repair and overhaul services in all of these segments. Pratt & Whitney sells products and services principally to aircraft manufacturers, airlines and other aircraft operators, aircraft leasing companies and the U.S. and foreign governments. Pratt & Whitney’s largest customer by sales is Airbus, with sales, prior to discounts and incentives, of 30%, 31% and 36% of total Pratt & Whitney segment sales in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Pratt & Whitney produces the PW1000G Geared Turbofan engine family, the first of which, the PW1100G-JM, entered into service in January 2016. The PW1000G Geared Turbofan engine has demonstrated a significant reduction in fuel burn and noise levels and lower environmental emissions when compared to legacy engines. The PW1100G-JM engine is offered on the Airbus A320neo family of aircraft. PW1000G Geared Turbofan engine models also power the Airbus A220 passenger aircraft and Embraer’s E-Jet E2 family of aircraft and have been selected to power the new Irkut MC-21 passenger aircraft. Mitsubishi and Pratt & Whitney have signed a contract in recognition of the formal pause in MRJ70 and MRJ90 engine development for the SpaceJet program. In addition, P&WC’s PW800 engine has been selected to exclusively power Gulfstream’s new G500 and G600 business jets, as well as to power Dassault’s new Falcon 6X business jet, which is scheduled to enter into service in 2022. Pratt & Whitney is under contract to produce and sustain the F135 engine for the U.S. government’s F-35 Joint Program Office to power the single-engine F-35 Lightning II aircraft (commonly known as the Joint Strike Fighter) produced by Lockheed Martin. F135 propulsion system configurations are used for the U.S Air Force’s F-35A, the U.S. Marine Corps’ F-35B and the U.S. Navy’s F-35C jets. F135 engines are also used on F-35 aircraft purchased by Joint Strike Fighter partner countries and foreign military sales countries. Pratt & Whitney is also under contract to build engines for the U.S. Air Force’s B-21 long-range strike bomber and to develop next-generation adaptive engines for the U.S. Air Force. The development of new engines and improvements to current production engines present important growth opportunities for Pratt & Whitney. In view of the risks and costs associated with developing new engines, Pratt & Whitney has entered into some collaboration arrangements in which revenues, costs and risks are shared with third parties. At December 31, 2020, the interests of third-party collaboration participants in Pratt & Whitney-directed commercial jet engine programs ranged, in the aggregate per program, from approximately 13% to 49%. See “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a description of our accounting for collaboration arrangements. Pratt & Whitney also continues to enhance its programs through performance improvement measures and product base expansion. In 2020, Pratt & Whitney reached significant milestones on the Geared Turbofan (GTF) engine program, including achieving an industry-leading engine dispatch reliability rate of 99.98% for the GTF engines for the Airbus A320neo. The GTF engine family now powers more than 900 aircraft across 50 airlines and three aircraft platforms: Airbus A320neo family, Airbus A220 and Embraer E-Jets E2 family. Pratt & Whitney also delivered the 50,000th PT6 turboprop engine in the General Aviation segment. Also in 2020, Pratt & Whitney received a significant number of contract awards for the F135 program, which powers all three variants of the F-35 Lightning II fighter aircraft. F135 production milestones achieved included the delivery of the 600th and 700th production engines. From a sustainment perspective, the F135 team supported the activation of half a dozen bases and ships around the world, including the first U.S. Navy aircraft carrier ready to deploy with F-35C aircraft on board. Significant activity continues on Adaptive Engine Transition Program, 6th-gen propulsion, and other development programs. Raytheon Intelligence & Space.

Other Matters Relating to Our Business As worldwide businesses, our operations can be affected by a variety of economic, industry and other factors, including those described in this section, in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” in Item 1, “Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results,” and in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K. COVID-19 Pandemic. In March 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and a national emergency by the U.S. government. Our business and operations and the industries in which we operate have been significantly impacted by public and private sector policies and initiatives in the U.S. and worldwide to address the transmission of COVID-19, such as the imposition of travel restrictions and the adoption of remote working, as well as public sentiments regarding air travel. In particular, the unprecedented decrease in air travel resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting our airline and airframer customers, and their demand for the products and services of our Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney segments. Our airline customers have reported significant reductions in fleet utilization, aircraft grounding and unplanned retirements, and have deferred and, in some cases, cancelled, new aircraft deliveries. They have shifted to cash conservation behaviors such as deferring engine maintenance due to lower flight hours and aircraft utilization, requesting extended payment terms, deferring delivery of new aircraft and spare engines and requesting discounts on engine maintenance. Some airline customers have filed for bankruptcy due to their inability to meet their financial obligations. 6 Table of C ontents Additionally, we are seeing purchase order declines in line with publicly communicated aircraft production volumes as original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers delay and cancel orders. In response to the COVID-19 impacts on our businesses, we have been and continue to actively mitigate costs and adjust production schedules to accommodate these declines in demand. We have also been taking actions to preserve capital and protect the long-term needs of our businesses, including cutting discretionary spending, significantly reducing capital expenditures and research and development spend, suspending our share buyback program in 2020, deferring merit increases and implementing temporary pay reductions, freezing non-essential hiring, repositioning employees to defense work, furloughing employees when needed, and reducing personnel. Our former Raytheon Company businesses, Raytheon Intelligence & Space and Raytheon Missiles & Defense, although experiencing minor impacts, have not experienced significant business disruptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. For additional information related to the COVID-19 pandemic, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K. Raytheon Merger Integration. We continue to make progress on our integration activities to realize the benefits of the Raytheon Merger, including synergies, cost savings, innovation and enterprise-wide technology sharing opportunities (including technology-driven revenue synergies) and operational efficiencies. We continue to integrate our business processes and systems, identify and mature technology and revenue synergy opportunities, achieve significant cost savings, harmonize our organizational model and policies, as well as promote a strong single-company culture. Numerous aspects of these activities will continue into 2021. Sales and Customers We have substantial U.S. government sales, which we conduct through all four of our business segments. Raytheon Intelligence & Space and Raytheon Missiles & Defense together represent a significant portion of those sales. In addition, as a global company, all four of our business segments have substantial international sales. U.S. Government Sales. Our U.S. government sales were as follows: (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Sales to the U.S. government (1) $ 25,962 $ 9,094 $ 6,560 Sales to the U.S. government as a percentage of total net sales (1) 46 % 20 % 19 % (1) Excludes foreign military sales through the U.S. government. See “Note 22: Segment Financial Data” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. International Sales. Our international sales were as follows: (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Total international sales (1) $ 22,027 $ 23,952 $ 19,035 Total international sales as a percentage of total net sales (1) 39 % 53 % 55 % (1) Includes foreign military sales through the U.S. government. See “Note 22: Segment Financial Data” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. Backlog. Backlog, which is equivalent to our remaining performance obligations (RPO), represents the aggregate amount of total contract transaction price related to firm orders that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied. Segment backlog does not include intercompany backlog. Our backlog by segment was as follows: (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 Collins Aerospace Systems $ 23,005 $ 26,260 Pratt & Whitney 78,135 85,183 Raytheon Intelligence & Space 18,676 — Raytheon Missiles & Defense 29,593 — Our consolidated RPO also includes the RPO of certain smaller non-reportable segments, which are not reflected in the table above. Approximately 70% of our consolidated backlog as of December 31, 2020 is not expected to be realized as sales in the next twelve months . Defense backlog primarily relates to backlog with government customers and is included within our total backlog. At December 31, 2020, our defense backlog was approximately 45% of total backlog. 7 Table of C ontents Competition All of our businesses are subject to significant competition. Our businesses compete on a variety of factors such as price, delivery schedule, past performance, reliability, customer service, product development, innovation and technology. Many of our competitors have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities. Further, some non-U.S. competitors receive government research and development assistance, marketing subsidies and other assistance for their products beyond the assistance that may be available to us as a U.S. company. In addition, the competitive landscapes in the industry segments we serve continue to evolve with trends such as increased vertical integration by competitors and customers and the emergence of more commercial competitors on defense development programs. Our aerospace businesses compete with numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers, customers and companies that obtain regulatory agency approval to manufacture spare parts. Customer selections of aircraft engines, components and systems can also have a significant impact on future sales of parts and services. In addition, the U.S. government’s and other governments’ policies of purchasing parts from suppliers other than the original equipment manufacturer affect military spare parts sales. Some competitors may offer substantial discounts and other financial incentives, performance and operating cost guarantees, and participation in financing arrangements in an effort to compete for the aftermarket associated with these products. Our defense businesses compete with numerous U.S. and foreign companies in most defense and government electronics, space, information technology and technical services and support segments. We frequently partner on defense programs with our major suppliers, some of whom are, from time to time, competitors on other programs. People As a technology and innovation-driven global company, RTC depends on a highly educated and skilled workforce. We seek to advance a diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment for all employees. Our ability to attract, develop and retain the best talent, particularly those with technical, engineering and science backgrounds or experience, is critical for us to execute our strategy and grow our businesses. In addition to providing market competitive compensation and benefits, we invest in our workforce through education, training and development programs. Additionally, we regularly conduct succession planning to ensure that we continue to cultivate the leadership pipeline of talent needed to execute our strategy. We continuously monitor the hiring, retention and management of our employees by business and function. We regularly conduct confidential surveys to seek feedback from our employees and use those results to improve our workplace. In addition, we have industry-leading health and safety as well as ethics and compliance programs to help mitigate associated employee risks. As of December 31, 2020, our global employee population consisted of a total of approximately 181,000 employees, including approximately 61,000 engineers and approximately 41,000 employees represented by labor unions and other employee representative bodies. Our employees are located in 71 countries, with approximately 71% of our employees located in the U.S., approximately 4% of our employees located in Canada, approximately 14% of our employees located in Europe, approximately 9% of our employees located in the Asia Pacific region, approximately 1% of our employees located in the Middle East and North Africa region and approximately 1% of our employees located in other regions. In 2020, our workforce was significantly impacted by the Separation Transactions, the Raytheon Merger and the COVID-19 pandemic. Upon completion of the Separation Transactions, a total of approximately 122,000 former UTC employees became employees of Carrier and Otis. Further, as a result of the Raytheon Merger, 71,000 Raytheon Company employees joined the 124,000 employees of UTC’s aerospace businesses as RTC employees. Following the Raytheon Merger, we have undertaken a number of actions to reduce our workforce and achieve cost synergies while retaining key talent necessary for RTC’s success. We are working towards a harmonized set of human resources systems and applications, programs and processes that will enable employees to more easily move across our businesses and functions and advance their careers within RTC. We also have engaged in additional succession planning as a result of the changes in our senior management team in connection with the Separation Transactions and the Raytheon Merger. In addition, we have taken extraordinary measures to protect our workforce in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We implemented extensive safety protocols to support our essential employees required to work onsite. We also enabled approximately 100,000 of our employees to work remotely, and we have sought to ensure that they have the technology, flexible work schedules, dependent care and other services needed during this time to enable them to work effectively from home. 8 Table of C ontents Due to the impact of the pandemic on our businesses in 2020, we have taken a number of actions, including deferring merit increases and implementing temporary pay reductions, freezing non-essential hiring, repositioning employees to defense work and making personnel reductions. In particular, Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney have taken steps to adjust their workforces to align with current and expected demand for their products and services. At Collins Aerospace, 11% of the workforce was impacted by reductions (excluding divestitures), and at Pratt & Whitney, 13% of the workforce was impacted by reductions. Our RIS and RMD businesses units have not been as severely impacted by the pandemic as Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney, and continued to hire in 2020 to support the growth of their businesses. Research and Development and Operations Our innovative products and services incorporate advanced technologies. As a result, we invest substantial amounts in research and development (R&D) activities using our own funds and under contractual arrangements with our customers, to enhance existing products and services and develop future technologies to meet our customers’ changing needs and requirements, as well as to address new business opportunities. We manufacture and service our products in over 240 manufacturing, production or overhaul facilities in approximately 30 countries, including the U.S. In addition, RTC has offices in another 10 countries. Intellectual Property We maintain a portfolio of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, licenses and franchises related to our businesses. We rely on a combination of these rights, along with nondisclosure agreements, IT security systems, internal controls and compliance systems and other measures to protect our intellectual property. The U.S. government and foreign governments have licenses to certain of our intellectual property, including certain patents, which are developed or used in the performance of government contracts. Commercial customers also have licenses to certain of our intellectual property largely in connection with the sale of our products. While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of each of our businesses, we do not believe that our business would be materially affected by the expiration of any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement. Suppliers and Raw Materials We are dependent upon the availability of materials and major components and the performance of our suppliers and subcontractors. Some of our products require relatively scarce raw materials. We generally have not experienced significant difficulties in procuring the necessary raw materials, components and other supplies for our products, but we may experience supply impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic if its impact on commercial aerospace continues. We are monitoring supplier liquidity and working continuously with our supply base to ensure an adequate source of supply and to reduce costs. We pursue cost reductions through a number of mechanisms, including consolidating our purchases, reducing the number of suppliers, strategic global sourcing and competitions among potential suppliers. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers. Like other users in the U.S., we are largely dependent upon foreign sources for certain raw materials, such as cobalt, tantalum, chromium, rhenium and nickel. We have a number of ongoing programs to manage this dependence and the accompanying risk, including long-term agreements and the conservation of materials through scrap reclamation and new manufacturing processes. In addition, in some cases, we must comply with specific procurement requirements, which may limit the suppliers and subcontractors we may utilize. Regulatory Matters Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation in the industries we serve. We deal with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, including but not limited to all of the branches of the DoD, the FAA, and the Department of Homeland Security. Similar government authorities exist in all of the countries in which we do business. U.S. Government Contracts. As previously discussed, the U.S. government is our largest customer, representing a substantial majority of our total defense sales. U.S. government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for convenience or for default in the event of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. In the case of a termination for convenience, we would normally be entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred, termination costs and a reasonable profit. If terminated by the government as a result of our default, we could be liable for payments made to us for undelivered goods or services, additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers. Our U.S. government contracts generally are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which sets forth policies, procedures and requirements for the acquisition of goods and services by the U.S. government; department-specific regulations that implement or supplement the FAR, such as the DoD’s Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS); and other applicable laws and regulations. These regulations impose a broad range of requirements, many of which are unique to government contracting, including various procurement, import and export, 9 Table of C ontents security, contract pricing and cost, contract termination and adjustment, audit and product integrity requirements. A contractor’s failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could result in reductions to the value of contracts, contract modifications or termination, cash withholds on contract payments, forfeiture of profits, and/or the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and fines, and could lead to suspension or debarment, for cause, from U.S. government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time. For further discussion of risks related to government contracting, including on-going litigation associated with U.S. government audits and investigations, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” in this Form 10-K and “Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Commercial Aerospace Product Regulation. Our commercial aerospace products generally are subject to regulations by the FAA, foreign aviation administration authorities and international regulatory bodies, including on production and quality systems, airworthiness and installation approvals, repair procedures and continuing operational safety. In addition, commercial aerospace regulations and regulator approaches differ across jurisdictions and changes in such regulations and implementing legislation can impact our operations. Environmental Regulation. Our operations are subject to and affected by environmental regulation by federal, state and local authorities in the U.S. and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our international operations, including with respect to the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We use hazardous substances and generate hazardous wastes in our operations and have incurred, and will likely continue to incur, costs associated with environmental compliance and management of sites with pollutants. A portion of these costs are eligible for future recovery through the pricing of our products and services under our contracts with the U.S. government. We do not anticipate that compliance with current provisions or requirements relating to the protection of the environment or that any payments we may be required to make for cleanup liabilities will have a material adverse effect upon our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations. Environmental matters are further addressed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” within Item 7 of this Form 10-K and “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” and “Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Most of the U.S. laws governing environmental matters include criminal provisions. If we were convicted of a violation of the federal Clean Air Act or Clean Water Act, the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be deemed ineligible to be used in performing any U.S. government contract we are awarded until the Environmental Protection Agency thereafter certifies that the condition giving rise to the violation has been corrected. We also manage various government-owned facilities on behalf of the U.S. government. At such facilities, environmental compliance and remediation costs have historically been primarily the responsibility of the U.S. government and we have relied (and continue to rely with respect to past practices) upon U.S. government funding to pay such costs. In addition, we could be affected by future laws or regulations imposed in response to concerns over climate change. Changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures, including increased energy and raw materials costs. For further discussion of risks related to environmental matters and other government regulations, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” in this Form 10-K and “Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Other Applicable Regulations. We conduct our businesses through subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide. As a result, our businesses and operations are subject to both U.S. and non-U.S. government laws, regulations and procurement policies and practices, including regulations relating to import-export controls, tariffs, investment, exchange controls, anti-corruption, and cash repatriation. Our international sales are also subject to varying currency, political and economic risks. 10 Table of C ontents Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results This Form 10-K contains statements which, to the extent they are not statements of historical or present fact, constitute “forward-looking statements” under the securities laws.

RISK FACTORS Our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by the factors set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. INDUSTRY RISKS Our Business May be Adversely Affected by Changes in Global Economic, Capital Market and Political Conditions. Our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions and geopolitical risks, including credit market conditions, levels of consumer and business confidence, commodity prices, exchange rates, potential changes in policy positions or priorities that emerge from a new U.S. Administration due to a variety of factors, levels of government spending and deficits, the threat environment, trade policies, political conditions, actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt and other challenges that could affect the global economy. These economic conditions affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways. Tightening of credit in financial markets could adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations, could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services, and could impact the ability of our customers to make payments. Similarly, such tightening of credit may adversely affect our supplier base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy. In addition, geopolitical risks, including changes in the threat environment and political conditions, could affect government priorities, budgets and policies, which could impact sales of defense and other products and services. Our global business is also adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity, such as decreases in business and consumer spending, air travel, the financial strength of airlines and business jet operators, and government procurement. Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Has Affected and Will Continue to Affect Our Business, Supply Chains, Operations and the Industries in which We Operate. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased global economic and demand uncertainty. Public and private sector policies and initiatives in the U.S. and worldwide to address the transmission of COVID-19, such as the imposition of travel restrictions and the adoption of remote working, have impacted the Company’s business, operations and the industries in which we operate. The disruption to air travel and commercial activities generally, and significant restrictions and limitations on businesses, attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global supply, demand and distribution capabilities of the aerospace and commercial airlines industries. In particular, the decrease in air travel resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the loss of business and leisure passenger traffic and is adversely affecting our airline and airframer customers, and their demand for our products and services. Aircraft manufacturers are reducing production rates due to fewer expected aircraft deliveries and cancelling new airframer programs, and, as a result, demand for our original equipment manufacturer (OEM) products has decreased. In addition, significant declines in aircraft flight hours are resulting in reduced demand for our aftermarket parts and services. Moreover, airlines and airline leasing companies have been deferring, and are expected to continue to defer, maintenance services, which negatively impacts our related revenues. Some airlines have accelerated retirement of certain aircraft, thereby eliminating our continuing services and negatively impacting our aftermarket revenues with respect to those aircraft. Further, a significant portion of our long-term support contracts are driven by actual usage, and decreased usage has, and will continue to, negatively affect our revenues associated with these types of contracts. COVID-19 may also limit the ability of our customers generally to perform, including in making timely payment to us. In addition, we provide aircraft financing commitments, in the form of debt or lease financing, to commercial aerospace customers. COVID-19 may increase the need for these customers to utilize these financing commitments due to the pandemic’s adverse impact on their businesses or the inability of these customers to obtain more favorable terms from other financing sources. If financing commitments are exercised, the Company will need to divert cash to satisfy them, and these customers may be unable to make payments. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted, and will continue to impact, the Company’s supply chains, including the ability of suppliers and vendors to provide their products and services to the Company. At this time, some of our suppliers have reduced or ceased operations as a result of COVID-19. This supply chain impact could also contribute to performance delays on our customer obligations and increase our costs. We are continuing to face operational challenges from the need to protect employee health and safety, workplace disruptions, and restrictions on the movement of people and goods, at our own facilities and at customers and suppliers. In addition, continued reduced operations and business disruption – including if significant portions of our workforce or our suppliers’ workforces are unable to work effectively due to facilities closures, illness, quarantines, government actions or other restrictions – could hinder or delay our production capabilities generally, and otherwise impede our ability to perform on our obligations to our customers, and may also result in increased costs to us. The continued spread of COVID-19 may also affect our ability to 13 Table of C ontents hire, develop and retain our talented and diverse workforce, and to maintain our corporate culture. Any costs associated with COVID-19 may not be fully recoverable or adequately covered by insurance. The COVID-19 pandemic also may materially impact U.S. government sales, including changes or shifts in defense spending due to budgetary constraints, the allocation of funds to governmental responses to COVID-19, a failure to complete the government budget process resulting in a Continuing Resolution (CR) or a government shutdown, or otherwise, and uncertain funding of programs. COVID-19 has impacted and may further impact the broader economies of affected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth, and creating volatility and unpredictability in financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. These impacts and the resulting volatility and disruption to the global capital markets may increase the cost of capital and may adversely impact access to capital for the Company and our suppliers and customers including heightened counter party risks associated with foreign exchange hedging transactions, interest rate swaps, solvency of revolving credit facility banks and the ability to raise capital both short-term and long-term. Any of these factors, depending on the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The ultimate financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown at this time. The extent of such impact depends on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted in the short- or long-term, including new information which may emerge concerning the scope, severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as any worsening of the pandemic, the effect of mutating strains and whether additional outbreaks of the pandemic will continue to occur, actions to contain the pandemic’s spread or treat its impact, timing of the availability of vaccines, and their distribution, acceptance and efficacy, and governmental, business and individual personal actions taken in response to the pandemic (including restrictions and limitations on travel and transportation, and changes in leisure and business travel patterns and work environments) among others. Some of these actions and related impacts may be trends that continue in the future even after the pandemic no longer poses a significant public health risk. Changes in U.S. Government Defense Spending Could Negatively Impact Our Financial Position, Results of Operations, Liquidity and Overall Business. U.S. government sales constitute a significant portion of our consolidated sales. Our U.S. government revenues largely result from contracts awarded under various U.S. government programs, primarily defense-related programs with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), and a broad range of programs with the U.S. Intelligence Community and other departments and agencies. Changes in U.S. government defense spending for various reasons, including as a result of potential changes in policy positions or priorities which may result from the recent U.S. presidential and congressional election, could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our programs are subject to U.S. government policies, budget decisions and appropriation processes which are driven by numerous factors including: (1) geopolitical events; (2) macroeconomic conditions; and (3) the ability of the U.S. government to enact relevant legislation, such as appropriations bills. In recent years, U.S. government appropriations have been affected by larger U.S. government budgetary issues and related legislation. In previous years the U.S. government has been unable to complete its budget process before the end of its fiscal year, resulting in both governmental shut-downs and CRs providing only enough funds for U.S. government agencies to continue operating at prior-year levels. Further, if the U.S. government debt ceiling is not raised and the national debt reaches the statutory debt ceiling, the U.S. government could default on its debts. As a result, U.S. government defense spending levels are subject to a wide range of outcomes and are difficult to predict beyond the near-term due to numerous factors, including the external threat environment, future governmental priorities and the state of governmental finances. Significant changes in U.S. government defense spending or changes in U.S. government priorities, policies and requirements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We Face Risks Relating to Our U.S. Government Contracts and the Mix of Our U.S. Government Contracts and Programs that Could Negatively Impact our Financial Condition, Results of Operations, Liquidity and Overall Business. The termination of one or more of our contracts, or the occurrence of performance delays, cost overruns, product failures, materials or components shortages, or contract definitization delays, could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. U.S. government contracts generally permit the government to terminate the contract, in whole or in part, without prior notice, at the U.S. government’s convenience or for default based on performance. If one of our contracts is terminated for convenience, we would generally be entitled to payments for our allowable costs and would receive some allowance for profit on the work performed. If one of our contracts is terminated for default, we would generally be entitled to payments for work accepted by the U.S. government. A termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability and have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future contracts and orders. In addition, we are a subcontractor and not the prime contractor on some contracts. In these arrangements, the U.S. government could terminate the prime contract for convenience or otherwise, 14 Table of C ontents without regard to our performance as a subcontractor. Further, we can give no assurance that we would be awarded new U.S. government contracts to offset the revenues lost as a result of the termination of any of our contracts. In addition, because the funding of U.S. government programs is subject to congressional appropriations made on a fiscal year basis even for multi-year programs, programs are often only partially funded initially and may not continue to be funded in future years. Appropriation bills may be delayed, which may result in delays to funding, the collection of receivables and our contract performance due to lack of authorized funds to procure related products and services. Under certain circumstances, we may use our own funds to meet our customer’s desired delivery dates or other requirements, but we may not be reimbursed. Further, if appropriations for one of our programs become unavailable, reduced or delayed, the U.S. government may terminate for convenience our contract or subcontract under that program. Our U.S. government contracts typically involve the development, application and manufacture of advanced defense and technology systems and products aimed at achieving challenging goals. New technologies may be untested or unproven and in some instances, product requirements or specifications may be modified. As a result, we may experience technological and other performance difficulties, which may result in delays, setbacks, cost overruns or product failures, and could divert our attention or resources from other projects. Our failure to execute effectively on our development programs could impact our future sales opportunities. Additionally, in order to win certain U.S. government contracts, we may be required to invest in development prior to award as our customers demand more mature and proven solutions. These additional investment amounts may not be worthwhile if we are not chosen for new contract awards. Our U.S. government contracts are typically either fixed-priced contracts or cost reimbursement contracts. Fixed-price contracts are predominantly either firm fixed-price (FFP) contracts or fixed-price incentive (FPI) contracts. Under FFP contracts, we receive a fixed price irrespective of the actual costs we incur and we therefore carry the burden of any cost overruns. Under FPI contracts, we generally share with the U.S. government savings for cost underruns less than target costs and expenses for cost overruns exceeding target costs up to a negotiated ceiling price. We carry the entire burden of cost overruns exceeding the ceiling price amount under FPI contracts. Under cost reimbursable contracts, we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fixed or performance-based fee, but we are generally not reimbursed for unauthorized costs exceeding a cost ceiling amount or costs not allowable under the contract or applicable regulations. If we are unable to control costs or if our initial cost estimates are incorrect, our profitability could be negatively affected, particularly under fixed-price development contracts. We may also experience cost underruns which would reduce contract value and related expected revenues, and we may be unable to expand the contract scope or secure additional work to offset the resulting lost revenues. While contracts for development programs with complex design and technical challenges are typically cost reimbursable, they can be FFP or FPI, which can significantly increase our risk of a potential negative profit adjustment, as development contracts by nature involve elements that have not been undertaken before and, thus, are highly subject to future unexpected cost growth. In addition, other contracts in backlog are for the transition from development to production, which includes starting and stabilizing a manufacturing and test line while the final design is still being validated. Over the past several years, the DoD has increased its use of Other Transaction Authority (OTA) contracts, under which it awards research and development work without all of the procurement requirements that typically apply to DoD contracts, including justification of sole source awards. For example, Raytheon Company was awarded an OTA contract for the Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS) in late 2019. OTAs may use fixed-price contracts during all phases of the contract, or mandated contract cost sharing (e.g., one-third of program costs). They may also require non-traditional subcontractor participation and impose other requirements that differ from our other DoD contracts. If we are unable to perform on our OTA contracts, including any applicable non-traditional requirements, it could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. From time to time, we may begin performance under an undefinitized contract action with a not-to-exceed price prior to completing contract negotiations in order to support U.S. government priorities. Uncertainties in final contract price, specifications and terms, or loss of negotiating leverage associated with particularly long delays in contract definitization, may negatively affect our profitability. In addition, as discussed more fully below, our U.S. government contracts also require us to comply with extensive and evolving procurement rules and regulations and subject us to potential U.S. government audits, investigations, and disputes. We are also involved in programs that are classified by the U.S. government, which have security requirements that place limits on our ability to discuss our performance on these programs, including any risks, disputes and claims. 15 Table of C ontents Our International Operations Subject Us to Economic Risk As Our Results of Operations and Liquidity May Be Adversely Affected by Changes in Foreign Currency Fluctuations, Economic Conditions, Political Factors, Trade Policies, Sales Methods, and Changes in Local Government Regulation. We conduct our business on a global basis, with a significant portion of sales derived from international operations, including U.S. export sales. Changes in local and regional economic conditions, including fluctuations in exchange rates, may affect product demand and reported profits in our non-U.S. operations where transactions may be denominated in local currencies. In addition, currency fluctuations may affect the prices we pay suppliers for materials used in our products. As a result, our operating margins also may be negatively impacted by worldwide currency fluctuations that result in higher costs for certain cross-border transactions. Our financial statements are denominated in U.S. Dollars. Accordingly, fluctuations in exchange rates may also give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements of non-U.S. operating units are translated into U.S. Dollars. A strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against other major foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations. In our commercial aerospace businesses, the majority of our sales are, consistent with established industry practice, transacted in U.S. Dollars, while the majority of costs at locations outside the U.S. are incurred in the applicable local currency (principally the Euro, the Canadian Dollar, the British Pound, and the Polish Zloty). For operating units with U.S. Dollar sales and local currency costs, there is foreign currency exposure that could impact our results of operations depending on market changes in the exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar against the applicable foreign currencies. In particular, Pratt & Whitney Canada is especially susceptible to fluctuations in exchange rates for this reason. To manage certain exposures, we employ long-term hedging strategies associated with U.S. Dollar sales. Our international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with local government laws, regulations and policies, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, taxation, exchange controls, capital controls, employment regulations, and cash repatriation. Government policies on international trade and investments such as import quotas, capital controls, taxes or tariffs, whether adopted by individual governments or regional trade blocs, can affect demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to manufacture or sell products in certain countries. The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs, or the renegotiation of existing trade agreements by the U.S. or by countries where we sell large quantities of products and services or procure supplies and other materials incorporated into our products, including in connection with the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union, could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Ongoing geopolitical uncertainty and trends such as populism and economic nationalism could negatively impact us. For example, a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or retaliation by another government against such policies, such as tariffs, could have a negative impact on our results of operations. Our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities, including government budgets, as well as to regional and local political and economic factors, including volatility in energy prices, changes in threat environments and geopolitical uncertainties, and changes in U.S. foreign policy. International transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs and contract laws and regulations, and include contractual terms that differ from those of similar contracts in the U.S. or that may be interpreted differently in foreign countries. As discussed more fully below, our international sales also require us to comply with U.S. laws, regulations and policies, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), and other anti-corruption, sanctions, and export laws and regulations. In addition, in certain foreign countries, our businesses engage non-employee sales representatives. From time to time, we have disputes with such representatives regarding claimed commissions and other matters which can result in litigation or arbitration if not resolved amicably. We conduct business in certain countries primarily for our commercial aerospace businesses including Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Morocco, Poland, Russia, South Africa, Turkey, Ukraine and countries in the Middle East and Central Asia, that carry high levels of currency, political, compliance and economic risk. We expect that sales to these and other emerging market customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our commercial aerospace sales in the long term as our businesses evolve and as these and other developing nations and regions around the world increase their demand for our products, particularly our aerospace products. Operations in emerging market countries can present many risks, including cultural differences (such as employment and business practices), volatility in gross domestic product, economic and government instability (particularly in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other Middle East countries), the imposition of exchange and capital controls, and the risks associated with exporting components manufactured in those countries for incorporation into finished products completed in other countries. While these factors and their impact are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or 16 Table of C ontents financial condition. Of note, in 2019 the U.S. government suspended Turkey’s participation in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program because Turkey accepted delivery of the Russian-built S-400 air and missile defense system. The U.S. has imposed, and may impose additional, sanctions on Turkey as a result of this or other political disputes. Turkish companies supply components, some of which are sole-sourced, to our aerospace businesses for commercial and military engines and aerospace products, as well as to our defense businesses. Depending upon the scope and timing of U.S. sanctions on Turkey and potential reciprocal actions, if any, such sanctions or actions could impact our sources of supply and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. In addition, in October 2020, the People’s Republic of China (China) announced that it may sanction RTC in connection with a possible Foreign Military Sale to Taiwan of six MS-110 Reconnaissance Pods and related equipment manufactured by Collins Aerospace. Foreign Military Sales are government-to-government transactions that are initiated by, and carried out at the direction of, the U.S. government. To date, the Chinese government has not imposed sanctions on RTC or indicated the nature or timing of any future potential sanctions or other actions. If China were to impose sanctions or take other regulatory action against RTC, our suppliers, teammates or partners, it could potentially disrupt our business operations. The impact of potential sanctions or other actions by China cannot be determined at this time. From time to time, our businesses have sold, and are expected to sell in the future additional defense products to Taiwan and we are unable to determine the potential impact, if any, of any future sanctions or other actions by China in response to these sales. Our international business faces substantial competition from both U.S. companies and foreign companies. In some instances, foreign companies may be owned by foreign governments or may receive loans, marketing subsidies and other assistance from their governments that may not be available to U.S. companies or our foreign subsidiaries. In addition, foreign companies may be subject to fewer restrictions on technology transfer than U.S. companies. Our international contracts, particularly for sales of defense products and services, may include industrial cooperation agreements requiring specific local purchases, manufacturing agreements, technology transfer agreements or financial support obligations, sometimes in the form of either offset obligations or in-country industrial participation (ICIP) agreements. Approvals of offset or ICIP thresholds and requirements may be subjective and time-consuming and may delay contract awards. Offset requirements may, in certain countries, include the creation of a joint venture with a local company that may control the venture. In addition, certain customers’ demands are increasing for greater offset or ICIP commitment levels, higher-value content, including the transfer of technologies and capabilities, and local production and economic development. Our use of and association with third-party foreign representatives and consultants for international sales, and teaming with international subcontractors, partners and suppliers in connection with international programs exposes us to various challenges including risks associated with the FCPA and local antibribery laws and regulations. As a result of the above factors, we could experience financial penalties and award and funding delays on international programs, our profitability on these programs could be negatively affected, and we could incur losses on these programs that could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our Financial Performance Is Dependent on the Condition of the Aerospace Industry. Our aerospace businesses constitute a substantial portion of our financial results, and the performance of those businesses is directly tied to the economic conditions in the commercial aerospace industry, which is cyclical in nature. Capital spending and demand for aircraft engines, aerospace products and component aftermarket parts and services by commercial airlines, aircraft operators and aircraft manufacturers are influenced by a wide variety of factors, including current and predicted traffic levels, load factors, aircraft fuel prices, labor issues, airline profits, airline consolidation, bankruptcies, competition, the retirement of older aircraft, regulatory changes, terrorism and related safety concerns, general economic conditions, corporate profitability, cost reduction efforts and remaining performance obligations levels. In particular, tightening of credit in financial markets could adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations, could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services, and could impact the ability of our customers to make payments. Similarly, such tightening of credit may adversely affect our supplier base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy. Any of these factors could reduce the sales and margins of our aerospace businesses. Other factors, including future terrorist actions, aviation safety concerns, pandemic health issues or major natural disasters, could also dramatically reduce the demand for commercial air travel, which could negatively impact the sales and margins of our aerospace businesses. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted, and continues to impact, our business, as described above. Additionally, because a substantial portion of product deliveries to commercial aerospace customers are scheduled for delivery in 2021 and beyond, changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled. At times, our aerospace businesses also enter into firm fixed-price or cost-share development contracts, which may require us to bear cost overruns related to unforeseen technical and design challenges that arise during the development and early production stages of the program. In addition, our aerospace businesses face intense competition from domestic and 17 Table of C ontents foreign manufacturers of new equipment, and approved non-OEM aftermarket spare parts and repairs. Spare parts sales and aftermarket service trends are affected by similar factors, including usage, pricing, technological improvements, regulatory changes and the retirement of older aircraft. Furthermore, because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing products in these business segments to market, we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is ready to enter into service. A reduction in spending in the commercial aviation industry could have a significant effect on the demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. We Design, Manufacture and Service Products that Incorporate Advanced Technologies; The Introduction of New Products and Technologies Involves Risks and We May Not Realize the Degree or Timing of Benefits Initially Anticipated; Competition May Reduce Our Revenues and Segment Share and Limit Our Future Opportunities. We seek to achieve growth through the design, development, production, sale and support of innovative commercial aerospace and defense systems and products that incorporate advanced technologies. The product, program and service needs of our customers change and evolve regularly, and we invest substantial amounts in research and development efforts to pursue advancements in a wide range of technologies, products and services. Of particular note, Pratt & Whitney is currently producing and delivering the PW1000G Geared Turbofan engine to power various aircraft, including the A320neo family of aircraft. The level of orders received for the Geared Turbofan family of engines, coupled with a requirement to achieve mature production levels in a very short time frame, require significant additional manufacturing and supply chain capacity. If any of our production ramp-up efforts are delayed, if suppliers cannot timely deliver or perform to our standards, and/or if we identify or experience issues with in-service engines, we may not meet customers’ delivery schedules, which could result in material additional costs, including liquidated damages or other liabilities that could be assessed under existing contracts. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our technological advancements depends on a variety of factors, including meeting development, production, certification and regulatory approval schedules; receiving regulatory approvals; execution of internal and external performance plans; availability of supplier and internally produced parts and materials; performance of suppliers and subcontractors; availability of supplier and internal facility capacity to perform maintenance, repair and overhaul services on our products; hiring and training of qualified personnel; achieving cost and production efficiencies; identification of emerging technological trends for our target end-customers; validation of innovative technologies; risks associated with the development of complex software; the level of customer interest in new technologies and products; and customer acceptance of products we manufacture or that incorporate technologies we develop. For example, our customers manufacture end products and larger aerospace systems that incorporate certain of our aerospace products. These systems and end products may also incorporate additional technologies manufactured by third parties and involve additional risks and uncertainties. As a result, the performance and industry acceptance of these larger systems and end products could affect the level of customer interest in and acceptance of our products in the marketplace. In addition, many of our products must adhere to strict regulatory and market-driven safety and performance standards in a variety of jurisdictions. The evolving nature of these standards, along with the long duration of development, production and support programs, creates uncertainty regarding program profitability, particularly with our aircraft engine products. Development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses, and these efforts may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings. In addition, the industries for our products or products that incorporate our technologies may not develop or grow as we anticipate. We or our customers, suppliers or subcontractors may encounter difficulties in developing and producing new products and services, and may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated or may otherwise suffer significant adverse financial consequences. Due to the design complexity of our products or those of our customers or third party manufacturers that incorporate our products into theirs or our customers’ products, we may experience delays in completing the development and introduction of new products or we may experience the suspension of production after these products enter into service due to safety concerns. Delays and/or suspension of production could result in increased development costs or deflect resources from other projects. In particular, we cannot predict with certainty whether, when and in what quantities our aerospace businesses will produce and sell aircraft engines, aircraft systems and components, and other products currently in development, pending required certifications or after entry into service. We operate in highly competitive industries and our competitors may have more extensive or more specialized engineering, manufacturing, marketing and servicing capabilities than we do. Our contracts are typically awarded on a competitive basis. Our bids are based upon, among other items, the cost to provide the products and services. To generate an acceptable return on our investment in these contracts, we must be able to accurately estimate our costs to provide the services and deliver the products and to be able to complete the contracts in a timely manner. If we fail to accurately estimate our costs or the time required to complete a contract, the profitability of our contracts may be materially and adversely affected. Some of our 18 Table of C ontents contracts provide for liquidated damages in the event that we are unable to perform and deliver in accordance with the contractual specifications and schedule. In addition, we may face customer-directed cost reduction targets that could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our contracts if these targets are not achieved when required. Moreover, we have seen highly competitive pricing, in which a bidder may anticipate making a substantial investment in a program in order to win the work. In addition, with respect to DoD awards in particular, bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards are frequent. Generally, a bid protest will delay the start of contract activities, delay earnings, and could result in the award decision being overturned and require a re-bid of the contract. Highly competitive activity within the commercial aerospace industry has included substantial discounts and other financial incentives, performance and operating cost guarantees, and participation in financing arrangements, in order to secure both new engine business and the aftermarket revenues associated with these products. Furthermore, our competitors, including our customers, may develop competing technologies which gain industry acceptance in advance of or instead of our products. The possibility also exists that our competitors or customers might develop new technologies or offerings that might cause our existing technologies and offerings to become obsolete and cause disruption to our business. In addition, the possibility exists that competitors or customers will develop aftermarket services and aftermarket parts for our products that attract customers and adversely impact our return on investment on new products. We also anticipate companies continuing to enhance their competitive position against our defense businesses as a result of continued domestic and cross-border defense industry consolidation and the expansion of competitors’ capabilities throughout the supply chain through vertical integration. We are also facing heightened competition domestically and internationally from foreign and multinational firms. Additionally, some customers, including the DoD, are increasingly turning to commercial contractors, rather than traditional defense contractors, for information technology and other support work. If we are unable to continue to compete successfully against our current or future competitors in our core businesses, we may experience declines in revenues and industry segment share. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. OPERATIONAL RISKS We Use a Variety of Raw Materials, Supplier-Provided Parts, Components, Sub-Systems and Contract Manufacturing Services in Our Businesses, and Significant Shortages, Supplier Capacity Constraints, Supplier Production Disruptions or Price Increases Could Increase Our Operating Costs and Adversely Impact the Competitive Positions of Our Products. Our reliance on U.S. and non-U.S. suppliers (including third-party manufacturing suppliers, subcontractors and service providers) and commodity markets to secure raw materials, parts, components and sub-systems used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials and services. In many instances, we depend upon a single source of supply, manufacturing, services support or assembly, or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers. Our defense businesses are subject to specific procurement requirements that limit the types of materials they use, which may further limit the suppliers and subcontractors they may utilize. They also must require suppliers to comply with various DoD cybersecurity requirements. A disruption in deliveries from our suppliers, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions, supplier quality issues (such as issues with defects or fraudulent parts), closing, bankruptcy or financial difficulties of our suppliers, price increases, or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities, including as a result of war, natural disaster, health pandemic or other business continuity events, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. We believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. Nonetheless, price increases, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions or the unavailability of some raw materials may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted, and continues to impact, our supply chain, as described above. Exports and Imports of Certain of Our Products Are Subject to Various Export Control, Sanctions and Import Regulations and May Require Authorization From the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Department of Justice or Regulatory Agencies of Other Countries. We must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the export and import of products, services and technology from and into the U.S. and other countries having jurisdiction over our operations. In the U.S., these laws and regulations include, among others, the EAR administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the ITAR administered by the U.S. Department of State, embargoes and sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and import regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Department of Justice. Certain of our products, services and technologies have military or strategic applications and are on the U.S. Munitions List of the ITAR and the 19 Table of C ontents Commerce Control List of the EAR or are otherwise subject to the EAR, or on the U.S. Munitions Import List and we are required to obtain licenses and authorizations from the cognizant U.S. government agencies before selling these products outside of the U.S. or importing these products into the U.S. U.S. foreign policy or foreign policy of other licensing jurisdictions may affect the licensing process or otherwise prevent us from engaging in business dealings with certain individuals, entities or countries. Any failure by us, our customers or our suppliers to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal penalties, fines, seizure of our products, adverse publicity, restrictions on our ability to export or import our products, or the suspension or debarment from doing business with the U.S. government. Moreover, any changes in export control, sanctions or import regulations may further restrict the export of our products or services, and the possibility of such changes requires constant monitoring to ensure we remain compliant. Our ability to obtain required licenses and authorizations on a timely basis or at all is subject to risks and uncertainties, including changing U.S. government foreign policies or laws, delays in Congressional action, or geopolitical and other factors. If we are not successful in obtaining or maintaining the necessary licenses or authorizations in a timely manner, our sales relating to those approvals may be prevented or delayed, and revenue and profit previously recognized may be reversed. Any restrictions on the export or import of our products or product lines could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Our Products Must Meet or Exceed Stringent Performance and Reliability Standards. Our products and services involve advanced technologies in highly sophisticated products. The impact of a catastrophic product failure or similar event, particularly in our commercial aerospace business, could be significant. Actual or perceived design or production issues can result in significant reputational harm to our business, in addition to direct warranty, maintenance and other costs that may arise. A significant product issue resulting in injuries or death, aircraft grounding or similar systemic consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position and results of operations. We may also incur increased costs, delayed payments or lost equipment or services revenue in connection with a significant issue with a third party’s product with which our products are integrated. There can be no assurance that we or our customers or other third parties will not experience operational process or product failures and other problems, including through manufacturing or design defects, process or other failures of contractors or third-party suppliers, cyber-attacks or other intentional acts, any of which could result in potential product, safety, quality, regulatory or environmental risks. If our products do not perform as intended, including with respect to safety or reliability, the possible consequences include product recalls and product liability claims, significant financial losses, including fines, as well as a diversion of management attention and reputational damage that could reduce demand for our products and services. Further, our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all related costs and we may not otherwise be fully indemnified for them. We Depend On the Recruitment and Retention of Qualified Personnel, and Our Failure to Attract, Train and Retain Such Personnel and to Maintain our Corporate Culture and High Ethical Standards Could Seriously Harm Our Business. Due to the specialized nature of our business, our future performance is highly dependent upon the continued services of our key technical personnel and executive officers, the development of additional management personnel, and the hiring of new qualified technical, manufacturing, marketing, sales and management personnel for our operations. Our defense business in particular requires qualified personnel with security clearances due to our classified programs. Competition for personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting, training or retaining qualified personnel with the requisite skills or security clearances. In addition, certain existing personnel may be required to receive various security clearances and substantial training in order to work on certain programs or perform certain tasks. Necessary security clearances may be delayed, which may impact our ability to perform on our U.S. government contracts. Further, we have experienced and may continue to experience personnel reductions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on our business and a significant percentage of our current workforce is nearing or eligible for retirement. To the extent that we lose experienced personnel, it is critical that we develop other employees, hire new qualified personnel and successfully manage the transfer of critical knowledge. In addition, new qualified personnel may have different expectations from our current workforce, which could result in difficulties attracting and retaining new employees. Loss of key employees, failure to attract new qualified employees or adequately train them, delays in receiving required security clearances, or delays in hiring key personnel could seriously harm our business. We believe that a critical element of our ability to successfully attract, train and retain qualified personnel is our corporate culture, which we believe fosters innovation, collaboration and a focus on execution, all in an environment of high ethical standards. Our global operations may present challenges in maintaining these important aspects of our corporate culture. Any failure to maintain our corporate culture could negatively impact our ability to attract, train and retain essential qualified personnel who are vital to our business. Further, we rely on our key personnel to lead with integrity and to meet our high ethical standards that promote excellent performance and cultivate diversity, equity and inclusion. To the extent any of our key personnel were to behave in a way that is inconsistent with our values, including with respect to product safety or quality, legal or regulatory compliance, financial reporting or people management, we could experience a materially adverse impact to our reputation and our operating results. 20 Table of C ontents Our Business and Financial Performance May Be Adversely Affected By Cyber-attacks on Information Technology Infrastructure and Products Our business may be impacted by disruptions to our own or third-party information technology (IT) infrastructure, which could result from, among other causes, cyber-attacks on or failures of such infrastructure or compromises to its physical security. We also encounter attempts to infiltrate our products and services and sabotage or disable their use by our customers. Cybersecurity threats are evolving and include, but are not limited to, both attacks on our IT infrastructure and attacks on the IT infrastructure of our customers, suppliers, subcontractors and other third parties with whom we do business routinely, both on premises and in the cloud, attempting to gain unauthorized access to our confidential or other proprietary information, classified information, or information relating to our employees, customers and other third parties, or to disrupt our systems or the systems of third parties. Cybersecurity threats also include attacks targeting the security, integrity and/or availability of the hardware, software and information installed, stored or transmitted in our products, including after the purchase of those products and when they are incorporated into third-party products, facilities or infrastructure, and insider threat attacks. Such attacks could disrupt our systems or those of third parties (including mission critical systems), impact business operations, result in unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, and corrupt our data or that of third parties. We have experienced cyber-based attacks, and due to the evolving threat landscape, may continue to experience them going forward, potentially with more frequency. The threats we face vary from attacks common to most industries to more advanced and persistent, highly organized adversaries, including nation states, which target us and other defense contractors. We continue to make investments and adopt measures designed to enhance our protection, detection, response, and recovery capabilities, and to mitigate potential risks to our technology, products, services and operations from potential cybersecurity threats. However, given the unpredictability, nature and scope of cyber-attacks, it is possible that we are unable to prevent cyber attacks, that potential vulnerabilities could go undetected for an extended period, that we may be unsuccessful in defending an attack against those vulnerabilities, or that we may otherwise be unable to mitigate customer losses and other potential consequences of these attacks. In addition, some products and services that we provide to customers, particularly those related to public security, may raise potential liabilities related to privacy and intellectual property. In some cases we must rely on the safeguards put in place by our customers, suppliers, subcontractors and other third parties to protect against and report cyber threats. We could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromise of confidential information, intellectual property or otherwise protected information, misappropriation, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our or third-party systems, networks or products, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business, or potential liability, penalties, fines and/or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Some of these risks may be heightened due to the Company and its suppliers and other third parties operating with a significant number of employees working remotely. Due to the evolving nature of such risks, the impact of any potential incident cannot be predicted. Further, our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all related costs and we may not otherwise be fully indemnified for them. Our Business and Financial Performance May Be Adversely Affected By Threats to Our Physical Security and Other Events Outside Our Control We could encounter threats to our physical security, including our facilities and personnel, and threats from terrorism, workplace violence or similar acts, any of which could disrupt our business. In addition, our business, and the businesses of our suppliers, subcontractors and service providers and customers, could be disrupted by public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, damaging weather or other acts of nature, or other events outside of our control. Our business may also be impacted by cyber-attacks on IT infrastructure and products, as discussed above. In addition, our business has been, and continues to be, impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as discussed above. Any such business disruption could subject us to production downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, financial losses from remedial actions, the diversion of management’s attention and resources, or loss of business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. The impact of any such business disruption is difficult to predict. We Depend On Our Intellectual Property, and Have Access to Certain Intellectual Property and Information of Our Customers and Suppliers; Infringement or Failure to Protect Our Intellectual Property Could Adversely Affect Our Future Growth and Success. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements, IT security systems, internal controls and compliance systems and other measures to protect our intellectual property. We also rely on nondisclosure agreements, confidentiality obligations in contracts, IT security systems and other measures to protect certain customer and supplier information and intellectual property that we have in our possession or to which we have access. The U.S. government and foreign governments have licenses under certain of our intellectual property, including certain patents, which are developed 21 Table of C ontents or used in performance of government contracts. Governments may use or authorize others (including our competitors) to use such patents and intellectual property for government and other purposes. Governments may challenge the sufficiency of intellectual property rights we have granted in government contracts and attempt to obtain greater rights, which could reduce our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and to compete. In some instances, we have augmented our technology base by licensing the proprietary intellectual property of others. Intellectual property obtained from third parties is also subject to challenge, invalidation, misappropriation or circumvention by third parties. In addition, we may not be able to obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms. In other instances, our ability to procure and perform government contracts requires us to obtain certain rights in the intellectual property of others through government grants. Governments may deny us the right to obtain such rights in the intellectual property of others, which may affect our ability to perform government contracts. Our efforts to protect intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient. We cannot be sure that our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents to us, that patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to preclude our competitors from introducing technologies similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the U.S. In addition, we may be the target of competitor or other third-party patent enforcement actions seeking substantial monetary damages or seeking to prevent our sale and marketing of certain of our products or services. Our competitive position also may be adversely impacted by limitations on our ability to obtain possession of, and ownership of necessary licenses concerning, data important to the development or provision of our products or service offerings, or by limitations on our ability to restrict the use by others of data related to our products or services. We may also be subject to disruptions, losses and liability resulting from various cybersecurity attacks or information technology failures, as described above. Any of these events or factors could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, subject us to judgments, penalties and significant litigation costs, or temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. LEGAL, ENVIRONMENTAL AND REGULATORY COMPLIANCE RISKS As a U.S. Government Contractor, We are Subject to Risks Relating to U.S. Government Audits, Investigations, and Disputes. We are subject to U.S. government investigations relating to our U.S. government contracts. Such U.S. government investigations often take years to complete and could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, including repayments, fines, treble and other damages, forfeitures, restitution or penalties, or could lead to suspension or debarment of U.S. government contracting or of export privileges. For instance, if we or one of our business units were charged with wrongdoing in connection with a U.S. government investigation (including fraud, or violation of certain environmental or export laws, as further described below), the U.S. government could suspend us from bidding on or receiving awards of new U.S. government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings. If convicted or found liable, the U.S. government could fine and debar us from new U.S. government contracting for a period generally not to exceed three years and could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud. We also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, even if such allegations are later determined to be unsubstantiated. Further, our U.S. government contracts are subject to audit and we have received audit reports recommending the reduction of certain contract prices because, for example, cost or pricing data disclosures or cost accounting practices used to price and negotiate those contracts may not have conformed to government regulations. Some of these audit reports recommend that certain payments be repaid, delayed, or withheld, and may involve substantial amounts, which could, if the audit reports’ theories were to prevail in litigation, also have future impacts such as increasing the costs absorbed by our commercial businesses. We have made voluntary refunds in those cases we believe appropriate, have settled some allegations and, in some cases, continue to negotiate and/or litigate. We may be, and have been, required to make payments into escrow of disputed liabilities while the related litigation is pending. If the litigation is resolved in our favor, any such payments will be returned to us with interest. The Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) and the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) also review the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies, including our accounting, purchasing, government property, estimating, earned value management and material management accounting systems. Our final allowable incurred costs for each year are subject to audit and have from time to time resulted in disputes between us and the U.S. government, including DCMA claims to recover payments for alleged noncompliance with cost accounting standards. In some cases, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has convened grand juries to investigate possible irregularities in our costs. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed or must be refunded if already reimbursed. An adverse outcome of any audit or investigation could result in civil and criminal penalties and fines, which could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, if allegations of impropriety were made against 22 Table of C ontents us, we could suffer serious reputational harm, which could negatively affect our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. We Are Subject to Litigation, Environmental, Product Safety and Reliability, Anti-Corruption and Other Legal and Compliance Risks. We are subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks. These risks relate to, among other things, product safety and reliability, personal injuries, intellectual property rights, contract-related claims, government contracts, taxes, environmental matters, export control, employment matters, competition laws and laws governing improper business practices. We or one of our businesses could be charged with wrongdoing as a result of such matters. If convicted or found liable, we could be subject to significant fines, penalties, repayments, or other damages (in certain cases, treble damages). As discussed above, product recalls and product liability and warranty claims (including claims related to the safety or reliability of our products) also can result in significant damages and costs, including fines, as well as negative publicity, a diversion of management attention and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services. As a global business, we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the U.S. and in other countries in which we operate. Those laws and regulations may be interpreted in different ways. They may also change from time to time, as may related interpretations and other guidance. Changes in laws or regulations could result in higher expenses. Uncertainty relating to laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights. Changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures, including increased energy and raw materials costs. Climate-related events also could disrupt our businesses and require us to incur additional costs. We use hazardous substances and generate hazardous wastes in our operations. As a result, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to personal injuries or property damage that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures. Personal injury lawsuits may involve individual and purported class actions alleging that contaminants originating from our current or former products or operating facilities caused or contributed to medical conditions, including cancers incurred by employees, former employees, third-parties’ employees or residents in the area, and environmental damage or diminution of real estate values. For example, we are investigating and remediating contamination related to past practices at a number of properties and, in some cases, have in the past been named as a defendant in related “toxic tort” claims. We are also subject to laws and regulations that: (1) impose requirements for the proper management, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes; (2) restrict air and water emissions from our operations (including U.S. government-owned facilities we manage); and (3) require maintenance of a safe workplace. These laws and regulations can lead to substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations, and may require the installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions, decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases, and/or reduce the risks of injury to people. We incur, and expect to continue to incur, capital and other expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations. A criminal violation of certain U.S. environmental statutes such as the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act could result in suspension, debarment or disqualification by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). A facility determined to be in violation of the criminal provisions of these statutes can be prohibited from performing any U.S. government contract work until the violation has been corrected and the EPA approves the reinstatement of the facility. Even in litigation where we believe our liability is remote, there is a risk that a negative finding or decision in a matter involving multiple plaintiffs or a purported class action could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, in particular with respect to environmental claims in regions where we have, or previously had, significant operations. In addition, new laws, regulations, or governmental policies, sudden changes in the interpretation and enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination, or the imposition of new clean-up standards could require us to incur additional costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, the FCPA and other anti-bribery and -corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to U.S. and non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. These laws apply to companies, individual directors, officers, employees and agents. U.S. companies also may be held liable for actions taken by strategic or local partners or representatives. The FCPA also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded U.S. corporations and their foreign affiliates, which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments. Certain of our customer relationships outside of the U.S. are with governmental entities and are therefore subject to the FCPA and other anti-bribery and -corruption laws, including the anti-bribery and -corruption laws of non-U.S. countries. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery and -corruption laws. Despite meaningful measures that we undertake to ensure lawful conduct, which include training and internal control policies, these measures may not always prevent violations of the FCPA or similar laws. We have been subject to regulatory investigations for alleged violations of anti-bribery and -corruption laws, and could be subject to such investigations in the future, which could result in criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement, further changes or enhancements to our procedures, policies and controls, personnel changes or other remedial actions. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our operations, cause 23 Table of C ontents reputational harm, involve significant management attention and result in a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Cybersecurity and data privacy and protection laws and regulations are evolving and present increasing compliance challenges, which may increase our costs, affect our competitiveness, cause reputational harm, and expose us to substantial fines or other penalties. ACCOUNTING, TAX AND INSURANCE RELATED RISKS We Use Estimates in Accounting For Many of Our Programs, and Changes in our Estimates Could Adversely Affect Our Future Financial Results. Accounting for long-term contracts and related assets requires estimates and judgments related to our progress toward completion and the long-term performance on the contract. Significant judgments include potential risks associated with the ability and cost to achieve program schedule, including customer-directed delays or reductions in scheduled deliveries, and technical and other specific contract requirements including customer activity levels and variable consideration based upon that activity. Due to the size and long-term nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Management must make assumptions and estimates regarding contract revenue and cost (such as estimates of variable consideration, including award fees and penalties), including with respect to: (1) labor productivity and availability; (2) the complexity and scope of the work to be performed; (3) the availability and cost of materials; (4) the length of time to complete the performance obligation; (5) execution by our subcontractors; (6) the availability and timing of funding from our customer; (7) overhead cost rates; and (8) current and past service cost and frequency driven by estimated aircraft and engine utilization and estimated useful lives of components, among other variables. Because of the significance of management’s judgments and estimation processes described above, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition. Significant Changes in Key Estimates and Assumptions, Such as Discount Rates and Assumed Long-term Return on Plan Assets (ROA), as well as Our Actual Investment Returns on Our Pension Plan Assets and Other Actuarial Factors, Could Affect Our Earnings, Equity and Pension Contributions in Future Periods. We must determine our pension and other postretirement benefit (PRB) plans’ expense or income, which involves significant judgment particularly with respect to our discount rate, long-term ROA and other actuarial assumptions. The discount rate assumption is set annually and we determine on an annual basis whether it is appropriate to change our long-term ROA assumption. These assumptions and other actuarial assumptions may change significantly due to changes in economic, legislative, and/or demographic experience or circumstances. Changes in our assumptions could result in negative changes to our pension and PRB plans’ expense and funded status, and our cash contributions to such plans, which would negatively impact our results of operations. In addition, differences between our actual investment returns and our long-term ROA assumption would result in a change to our pension and PRB plans’ expense and funded status and our required contributions to the plans. Our plan assets are invested in accordance with our investment management objectives and are subject to market volatility and other conditions. The differences may also be impacted by changes in regulatory, accounting and other requirements applicable to pensions. Additional Tax Expense or Additional Tax Exposures Could Affect Our Future Profitability. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and international jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Changes in tax laws and regulations, as well as changes and conflicts in related interpretations and other tax guidance, and fluctuations in taxable income could materially impact our tax receivables and liabilities and our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business we are subject to examinations by various tax authorities. In addition to ongoing examinations, there could be additional examinations launched in the future by governmental authorities in various jurisdictions, and existing examinations could be expanded. The final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Additionally, changes in the geographic mix of our sales could impact our tax liabilities and affect our income tax expense and profitability. The global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional examinations, proceedings and contingencies will arise from time to time. Our competitive position, cash flows, results of operation or financial condition may be affected by the outcome of examinations, proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty. 24 Table of C ontents Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Represent a Significant Portion of Our Assets, and Any Impairment of These Assets Could Negatively Impact Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition. A significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other intangible assets, including amounts added related to the Raytheon Merger. Our goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are subject to an impairment test annually and are also tested whenever events and circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. In the event of an impairment any excess of the carrying value of these assets over the fair value must be written off in the period of determination. Finite-lived intangible assets are generally amortized over the useful life of such assets. In addition, from time to time, we may acquire or make an investment in a business which will require us to record goodwill and intangible assets based on the purchase price and the value of the acquired assets. We may subsequently experience unforeseen events that could adversely affect the value of our goodwill or intangible assets and trigger an impairment evaluation. Future determinations of significant impairments of goodwill or intangible assets as a result of an impairment test or any accelerated amortization of other intangible assets could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. We Face Certain Significant Risk Exposures and Potential Liabilities That May Not Be Adequately Covered By Indemnity or Insurance. A significant portion of our business relates to designing, developing and manufacturing advanced aerospace, defense and technology systems and products. New technologies may be untested or unproven. In addition, we may incur significant liabilities that are unique to our products and services. In some, but not all, circumstances, we may be entitled to indemnification from our customers through contractual provisions, and we may obtain limitations of liability and additional defenses for various reasons including the qualification of our products and services by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) under the SAFETY Act provisions of the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The insurance coverage we maintain or indemnification to which we may be contractually or otherwise entitled may not be adequate to cover all claims or liabilities. Accordingly, we may be forced to bear substantial costs resulting from risks and uncertainties of our business, which would negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Any accident, failure of, or defect in our products and services, even if fully indemnified or insured, could negatively affect our reputation among our customers and the public, and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively. It could also affect the cost and availability of insurance in the future. STRATEGIC TRANSACTIONS RISKS We May Be Unable to Realize Expected Benefits From Our Cost Reduction and Restructuring Efforts and Our Profitability May Be Hurt or Our Business Otherwise Might Be Adversely Affected. In order to operate more efficiently and control costs, we announce from time to time restructuring plans, which include workforce reductions, global facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives. These plans are intended to generate operating expense savings through reductions in direct and indirect expenses as well as improved efficiencies. We may undertake further workforce reductions or restructuring actions in the future. These types of cost reduction and restructuring activities are complex. If we do not successfully manage our current restructuring activities, or any future restructuring activities, expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized, and our operations and business could be disrupted. Risks associated with these actions and other workforce management issues include unfavorable political responses to such actions, unforeseen delays in the implementation of anticipated workforce reductions, additional unexpected costs, adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees or work stoppages, any of which may impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions, or otherwise harm our business, or have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. We May Be Unable to Successfully Integrate the Legacy Businesses of United Technologies Corporation (UTC) and Raytheon and Realize the Anticipated Benefits of the Raytheon Merger. The success of the Raytheon Merger will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine and integrate UTC and Raytheon Company’s legacy businesses, and realize the anticipated benefits, including synergies, cost savings, innovation and technological opportunities (including technology-driven revenue synergies) and operational efficiencies from the Raytheon Merger in a manner that does not materially disrupt existing customer, supplier and employee relations and does not result in decreased revenues due to losses of, or decreases in orders by, customers. The integration of the two companies may result in material challenges, including, without limitation: • managing a larger, more complex combined aerospace and defense business; • maintaining employee morale, retaining key management and other employees, and managing corporate culture; • retaining existing business and operational relationships, including customers, suppliers and employees and other counterparties, as may be impacted by contracts containing consent and/or other provisions that may be triggered by the Raytheon Merger, and attracting new business and operational relationships; 25 Table of C ontents • the diversion of management’s attention as a result of devoting attention to matters relating to the Raytheon Merger and/or the Separation and the Distributions following their consummation; • consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations, including unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems; and • coordinating geographically separate organizations The impact and extent of these challenges is uncertain and many of them have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Any one of them could result in delays, increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues, reduced expected cash generation, and diversion of management’s time and energy, which could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, as a result of the Separation Transactions and Distributions, we are required to provide transition services to each of Carrier Global Corporation (Carrier) and Otis Worldwide Corporation (Otis). These services may require significant amounts of personnel and management time, attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business, financial results and results of operations during this critical period of our integration. In addition, we must continue to manage the integration of other companies, assets and businesses, including the integration of Rockwell Collins, which UTC acquired on November 26, 2018. These ongoing (and future) integrations by each of UTC and Raytheon may increase the complexity of, and challenges associated with, the integration of UTC and Raytheon Company’s legacy businesses, which may make it more difficult for us to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Raytheon Merger fully, or within the anticipated time frame. The actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized on a timely basis. While we have assumed that a certain level of expenses would be incurred, many of the expenses that may be incurred are, by their nature, difficult to estimate accurately, and changes to the estimates could affect the total amount or timing of integration expenses. These expenses could exceed benefits expected to be realized in connection with the Raytheon Merger. We May Not Be Able to Engage in Desirable Capital-Raising or Strategic Transactions. Under current U.S. federal income tax law, a spin-off that otherwise qualifies for tax-free treatment can be rendered taxable to the parent corporation and its stockholders as a result of certain post-spin-off transactions, including certain acquisitions of shares or assets of the parent corporation. To preserve the tax-free treatment of the Distributions, we may be limited in our ability to pursue certain equity issuances, strategic transactions, repurchases, or other transactions (including the certain dispositions of assets) that we may otherwise believe to be in the best interests of our stockholders or that might increase the value of our business. If Either Distribution, Together with Certain Related Transactions, Were to Fail to Qualify as a Transaction that is Generally Tax-Free, Including as a Result of Subsequent Acquisitions of Our Stock (Including Pursuant to the Raytheon Merger) or the Stock of Carrier or Otis, We Could Be Subject to Significant Tax Liabilities. We received (1) a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regarding certain U.S. federal income tax matters relating to the Separation Transactions and Distributions and (2) an opinion of outside counsel regarding the qualification of certain elements of the Distributions under Section 355 of the Code. Although we intend for the Distributions generally to be tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, there can be no assurance that they will so qualify. Even if the Distributions were to otherwise qualify as tax-free transactions under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code, either Distribution or both Distributions may result in taxable gain to us (but not our stockholders) under Section 355(e) of the Code if such Distribution(s) were deemed to be part of a plan (or series of related transactions) pursuant to which one or more persons acquire, directly or indirectly, shares representing a 50% or greater interest (by vote or value) in shares of Carrier, Otis, or us, as applicable. If the IRS were to determine that any post-Distribution acquisitions of Carrier stock, Otis stock, or our stock, as applicable, pursuant to such a plan (when aggregated with any pre-Distribution acquisitions of Carrier stock, Otis stock, or our stock, as applicable, pursuant to such a plan) would represent a 50% or greater interest in shares of Carrier, Otis, or us, as applicable, such determination could result in significant tax liabilities to us. For purposes of this test, even if the Raytheon Merger were treated as part of such plan, it did not result in an acquisition of a 50% or greater interest in our shares pursuant to a plan. Any such tax liabilities imposed on us may adversely affect an investment in us. In addition, with respect to certain Separation Transactions, we obtained tax rulings in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions and/or opinions of external tax advisors, in each case, regarding the tax treatment of such Separation Transactions. Notwithstanding the receipt of such tax rulings and opinions, there can be no assurance that the relevant taxing authorities will not assert that the tax treatment of the relevant Separation Transactions differs from the conclusions reached therein. In the event the relevant taxing authorities prevail with any challenge in respect of any relevant Separation Transaction, we would be subject to significant tax liabilities, which may adversely affect an investment in us. 26 Table of C ontents Under a tax matters agreement that we entered into with Carrier and Otis in connection with the Separation Transactions and Distributions, each of Carrier and Otis generally is required to indemnify us for any taxes we incur resulting from the Separation Transactions and/or the Distributions to the extent such amounts result from certain disqualifying actions by, or acquisition of equity securities of, Carrier or Otis, as applicable. Further, under the tax matters agreement, each of Carrier and Otis is generally required to indemnify us for a specified portion of any taxes we incur (a) arising as a result of the failure of either of the Distributions and certain related transactions to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free or a failure of any Separation Transaction that is intended to qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free to so qualify, in each case, to the extent such amounts did not result from a disqualifying action by, or acquisition of equity securities of, Carrier, Otis, or us or (b) arising from certain audit or other adjustments to tax liabilities incurred with respect to Separation Transactions that were not intended to qualify as tax-free. In addition, under the tax matters agreement, each of Carrier and Otis is responsible for (i) a specified portion of any installment payment we are required to make pursuant to Section 965(h)(2) of the Code and (ii) specified taxes that exclusively relate to the Carrier business or the Otis business, as applicable. The amount of any such taxes for which we would be responsible may be significant, and if we were unable to obtain indemnification payments from Carrier or Otis to which we are entitled under the tax matters agreement and/or other agreements entered into in connection with the Separation Transactions and the Distributions, we would incur significant losses. If We Fail to Manage Potential Future Acquisitions, Investments, Divestitures, Joint Ventures and Other Transactions Successfully, These Activities Could Adversely Affect Our Future Financial Results. In pursuing our business strategies, we continually review, evaluate and consider potential investments, acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures and other teaming and collaborative arrangements. We undertake to identify opportunities that will complement our existing products and services or customer base, as well as expand our offerings and business opportunities into new areas that naturally extend from our core capabilities. In evaluating such transactions, we are required to make difficult judgments regarding the value of business opportunities, technologies and other assets, and the risks and cost of potential liabilities. Further, these transactions involve certain other risks and uncertainties including: (1) the risks involved with entering new markets; (2) the difficulty in integrating newly-acquired businesses and managing or monitoring other collaborative business arrangements; (3) challenges and failures in achieving strategic objectives and other expected benefits, which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments; (4) unidentified issues not discovered in the Company’s due diligence; (5) the diversion of our attention and resources from our operations and other initiatives; (6) the potential impairment of acquired assets; (7) the performance of underlying products, capabilities or technologies; and (8) the potential loss of key employees and customers of acquired businesses. In addition, future transactions may impact our deployment of capital, including dividends, stock repurchases, pension contributions, and investments. GENERAL RISK Quarterly Cash Dividends and Share Repurchases Are Subject to a Number of Uncertainties, and May Affect the Price of Our Common Stock. Quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases under our share repurchase program generally constitute components of our capital allocation strategy, which we fund through a combination of operating free cash flow, borrowings and proceeds from divestitures. However, we are not required to declare dividends or make any share repurchases under our share repurchase program. Dividends and share repurchases may be discontinued, accelerated, suspended or delayed at any time without prior notice. Even if not discontinued, the amount of such dividends and repurchases may be changed, and the amount, timing and frequency of such dividends and repurchases may vary from historical practice or from the company’s stated expectations. Decisions with respect to dividends and share repurchases are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be based on a variety of factors. Important factors that could cause us to discontinue, limit, suspend, increase or delay our quarterly cash dividends or share repurchases include market conditions, the price of our common stock, the nature and timing of other investment opportunities, changes in our business strategy, the terms of our financing arrangements, our outlook as to the ability to obtain financing at attractive rates, the impact on our credit ratings and the availability of domestic cash. The reduction or elimination of our cash dividend, or longer suspension or elimination of our share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Additionally, there can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance shareowner value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock, and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program’s effectiveness. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. 27 Table of C ontents ITEM 2. PROPERTIES We have properties in approximately 30 countries, with approximately 550 significant properties comprising approximately 80 million square feet of productive space. Approximately 55% of our significant properties are leased, and 45% are owned. Approximately 70% of our significant properties are located in the United States. Our fixed assets as of December 31, 2020 include manufacturing facilities and non-manufacturing facilities such as warehouses, laboratories, office space, and a substantial quantity of machinery and equipment, including general purpose machinery and equipment using special jigs, tools and fixtures and in many instances having automatic control features and special adaptations. The facilities, warehouses, machinery and equipment in use as of December 31, 2020 are in good operating condition, are well-maintained and substantially all are generally in regular use. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries and our properties are subject to regulatory and governmental examinations, information gathering requests, inquiries, investigations and threatened legal actions and proceedings. For example, we are now, and believe that, in light of the current U.S. government contracting environment, we will continue to be the subject of one or more U.S. government investigations. Our contracts with the U.S. government are also subject to audits. Agencies that oversee contract performance include: the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA), the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), the Inspectors General of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and other departments and agencies, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the Department of Justice (DOJ), and Congressional Committees. Other areas of our business operations may also be subject to audit and investigation by these and other agencies. From time to time, agencies investigate or conduct audits to determine whether our operations are being conducted in accordance with applicable requirements. Such investigations and audits may be initiated due to a number of reasons, including as a result of a whistleblower complaint. Such investigations and audits could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, including repayments, fines, treble or other damages, forfeitures, restitution, or penalties being imposed upon us, the suspension of government export licenses or the suspension or debarment from future U.S. government contracting. U.S. government investigations often take years to complete. The U.S. government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent, criminal or other seriously improper conduct. The U.S. government could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud. Like many defense contractors, we have received audit reports recommending the reduction of certain contract prices because, for example, cost or pricing data or cost accounting practices used to price and negotiate those contracts may not have conformed to government regulations. Some of these audit reports recommend that certain payments be repaid, delayed, or withheld, and may involve substantial amounts. We have made voluntary refunds in those cases we believe appropriate, have settled some allegations and, in some cases, continue to negotiate and/or litigate. The Company may be, and has been, required to make payments into escrow of disputed liabilities while the related litigation is pending. If the litigation is resolved in the Company’s favor, any such payments will be returned to the Company with interest. Our final allowable incurred costs for each year are also subject to audit and have, from time to time, resulted in disputes between us and the U.S. government, with litigation resulting at the Court of Federal Claims (COFC) or the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (ASBCA) or their related courts of appeals. In addition, the DOJ has, from time to time, convened grand juries to investigate possible irregularities by us. We also provide products and services to customers outside of the U.S., and those sales are subject to local government laws, regulations and procurement policies and practices. Our compliance with such local government regulations or any applicable U.S. government regulations (e.g., the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)) may also be investigated or audited. Other than as specifically disclosed in this Form 10-K, we do not expect these audits, investigations or disputes to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity, either individually or in the aggregate. 737 MAX Aircraft Litigation Multiple lawsuits have been filed in U.S. courts relating to the October 29, 2018 Lion Air Flight 610 and the March 10, 2019 Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 accidents. Collins Aerospace sold certain aircraft parts and systems to The Boeing Company for the 737 MAX aircraft involved in these accidents. Certain of our Collins Aerospace businesses have been named, along with other third parties, as parties in many of these lawsuits. We are also fully supporting all ongoing governmental investigations and inquiries relating to the accidents. We do not expect that the lawsuits or governmental investigations or inquiries will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, we are subject to a number of other lawsuits, investigations and claims (some of which involve substantial amounts). For a discussion of contingencies related to certain other legal proceedings, see “Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. We do not believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect upon our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. 28 Table of C ontents A further discussion of government contracts and related investigations, as well as a discussion of our environmental liabilities, can be found under the heading “Other Matters Relating to Our Business as a Whole – Compliance with Environmental and Other Government Regulations” within Item 1.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES On April 3, 2020, United Technologies Corporation (UTC) completed the previously announced separation of its business into three independent, publicly traded companies – UTC, Carrier Global Corporation (Carrier) and Otis Worldwide Corporation (Otis) (such separations, the “Separation Transactions”). UTC distributed all of the outstanding shares of Carrier common stock and all of the outstanding shares of Otis common stock to UTC shareowners who held shares of UTC common stock as of the close of business on March 19, 2020, the record date for the distributions (the Distributions) effective at 12:01 a.m., Eastern Time, on April 3, 2020. On April 3, 2020, following the completion of the Separation Transactions and the Distributions, UTC and Raytheon Company completed their previously announced all-stock merger of equals transaction (the “Raytheon Merger”). Upon closing of the Raytheon Merger, UTC changed its name to “Raytheon Technologies Corporation.” Raytheon Technologies’ common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “RTX.” There were approximately 45,151 registered shareowners at January 29, 2021. The information required by Item 5 with respect to securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans is incorporated herein by reference to the section of our Proxy Statement for the 2021 Annual Meeting of Shareowners titled “Approve Amendment to the Raytheon Technologies Corporation 2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan.” Stock Performance Graph The following graph presents the cumulative total shareowner return for the five years ending December 31, 2020 for our common stock as compared to the Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Index, the Dow Jones 30 Industrial Average and the S&P Aerospace & Defense (A&D) Index.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BUSINESS OVERVIEW We are a global premier systems provider of high technology products and services to the aerospace and defense industries. On April 3, 2020, United Technologies Corporation (UTC) completed the Separation Transactions as defined below, and on April 3, 2020, completed the Raytheon Merger as defined below, to form the new company, Raytheon Technologies Corporation. As a result of these transactions, we now operate in four principal business segments: Collins Aerospace Systems (Collins Aerospace), Pratt & Whitney, Raytheon Intelligence & Space (RIS) and Raytheon Missiles & Defense (RMD). Separation Transactions and Distributions . On April 3, 2020, UTC (since renamed Raytheon Technologies Corporation) completed the separation of its business into three independent, publicly traded companies – UTC, Carrier Global Corporation (Carrier) and Otis Worldwide Corporation (Otis) (such separations, the “Separation Transactions”). UTC distributed all of the outstanding shares of Carrier common stock and all of the outstanding shares of Otis common stock to UTC shareowners who held shares of UTC common stock as of the close of business on March 19, 2020, the record date for the distributions (the Distributions). UTC distributed 866,158,910 and 433,079,455 shares of common stock of Carrier and Otis, respectively in the Distributions, each of which was effective at 12:01 a.m., Eastern Time, on April 3, 2020. The historical results of Carrier and Otis are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless otherwise indicated, amounts and activity are presented on a continuing operations basis. Raytheon Merger. On April 3, 2020, following the completion of the Separation Transactions and the Distributions, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated June 9, 2019, as amended, UTC and Raytheon Company (Raytheon) completed their all-stock merger of equals transaction (the Raytheon Merger). Upon closing of the Raytheon Merger, Raytheon Company became a wholly owned subsidiary of UTC, which changed its name to “Raytheon Technologies Corporation.” On November 26, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Rockwell Collins (the Rockwell Acquisition), a leader in aviation and high-integrity solutions for commercial and military customers as well as leading-edge avionics, flight controls, aircraft interior and data connectivity solutions. Refer to “Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional discussion on the Rockwell Acquisition. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “we,” “our,” “us,” “the Company,” “Raytheon Technologies,” and “RTC” mean United Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries when referring to periods prior to the Raytheon Merger and to the combined company, Raytheon Technologies Corporation, when referring to periods after the Raytheon Merger. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “Raytheon Company,” or “Raytheon” mean Raytheon Company and its subsidiaries prior to the Raytheon Merger. UTC was determined to be the accounting acquirer in the merger, and as a result the financial statements of Raytheon Technologies for year ended December 31, 2020 include Raytheon Company’s financial position and results of operations for the period subsequent to the completion of the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020. The historical results of Carrier and Otis are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. See “Note 3: Discontinued Operations” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. Industry Considerations Our worldwide operations can be affected by industrial, economic and political factors on both a regional and global level. Our operations include original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and extensive related aftermarket parts and services related to our aerospace operations. Our defense business serves both domestic and international customers primarily as a prime contractor or subcontractor on a broad portfolio of defense and related programs for government customers. Our business mix also reflects the combination of shorter cycles in our commercial aerospace spares contracts and certain service contracts in our defense business primarily at RIS, and longer cycles in our aerospace OEM and aftermarket maintenance contracts and on our defense contracts to design, develop, manufacture or modify complex equipment. Our customers are in the public and private sectors, and our businesses reflect an extensive geographic diversification that has evolved with continued globalization. Government legislation, policies and regulations, including regulations related to global warming, carbon footprint and fuel efficiency, can have a negative impact on our worldwide operations. Government and industry-driven safety and performance regulations, restrictions on aircraft engine noise and emissions, government imposed travel restrictions, and government procurement practices can impact our businesses. Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney serve both commercial and government aerospace customers. Revenue passenger miles (RPMs), available seat miles and the general economic health of airline carriers are key barometers for our commercial aerospace operations. Performance in the general aviation sector is closely tied to the overall health of the economy and is 33 Table of C ontents positively correlated to corporate profits. Our commercial aftermarket operations continue to evolve as a significant portion of our aerospace operations’ customers are covered under long-term aftermarket service agreements at both Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney. These agreements are comprehensive long-term spare part and service agreements with our customers. RIS, RMD, and the defense operations of Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney are affected by U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) budget and spending levels, changes in demand, changes in policy positions or priorities from a new U.S. Administration and the global political environment. Total sales to the U.S. government, excluding foreign military sales (FMS), were $26.0 billion, $9.1 billion and $6.6 billion in 2020, 2019 and 2018 or 45.9%, 20.1% and 18.9% of total net sales for those years, respectively. Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic In March 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and a national emergency by the U.S. government. The pandemic has negatively affected the U.S. and global economy, disrupted global supply chains and financial markets, and resulted in significant travel restrictions, mandated facility closures and shelter-in-place and social distancing orders in numerous jurisdictions around the world. Raytheon Technologies is taking all prudent measures to protect the health and safety of our employees, such as practicing social distancing, performing deep cleaning in all of our facilities, temperature screening, health questionnaires and enabling our employees to work from home where possible. We have also taken appropriate actions to help support our communities in addressing the challenges posed by the pandemic, including the production and donation of personal protective equipment. Our business and operations and the industries in which we operate have been significantly impacted by public and private sector policies and initiatives in the U.S. and worldwide to address the transmission of COVID-19, such as the imposition of travel restrictions and the adoption of remote working. Additionally, public sentiments regarding air travel have also had a significant impact. We began to experience issues related to COVID-19 in the first quarter of 2020, primarily related to a limited number of facility closures, less than full staffing, and disruptions in supplier deliveries, most significantly in our Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney businesses. The continued disruption to air travel and commercial activities and the significant restrictions and limitations on businesses, particularly within the aerospace and commercial airline industries, have negatively impacted global supply, demand and distribution capabilities. These conditions, which began in the second quarter of 2020, continued through the remainder of 2020. In particular, the unprecedented decrease in air travel resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting our airline and airframer customers, and their demand for the products and services of our Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney businesses. Based on recent public data, revenue passenger miles (RPMs) declined by approximately 65% in the first eleven months of 2020, compared to the prior year, due to the pandemic. As a result, our airline customers have reported significant reductions in fleet utilization, aircraft grounding and unplanned retirements, and have deferred and, in some cases, cancelled new aircraft deliveries. Airlines have shifted to cash conservation behaviors such as deferring engine maintenance due to lower flight hours and aircraft utilization, requesting extended payment terms, deferring delivery of new aircraft and spare engines and requesting discounts on engine maintenance. Some airline customers have filed for bankruptcy due to their inability to meet their financial obligations. Additionally, we are seeing purchase order declines in line with publicly communicated aircraft production volumes as original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers delay and cancel orders. We continue to monitor these trends and are working closely with our customers. We have been and continue to actively mitigate costs and adjust production schedules to accommodate these declines in demand. We have also been taking actions to preserve capital and protect the long-term needs of our businesses, including cutting discretionary spending, significantly reducing capital expenditures and research and development spend, suspending our share buybacks in 2020, deferring merit increases and implementing temporary pay reductions, freezing non-essential hiring, repositioning employees to defense work, furloughing employees when needed, and personnel reductions. In 2020, we recorded total restructuring charges of $777 million primarily related to personnel reductions at our Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney businesses to preserve capital and at our corporate headquarters due to consolidation from the Raytheon Merger. The former Raytheon Company businesses, although experiencing minor impacts, have not experienced significant facility closures or other significant business disruptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the impacts described above that have resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect our future operating results, particularly those of our Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney businesses to continue to be significantly negatively impacted. Our expectations regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and its potential financial impact are based on available information and assumptions that we believe are reasonable at this time; however, the actual financial impact is highly uncertain and subject to a wide range of factors and future developments. While we believe that the long-term outlook for the aerospace industry remains positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel demand, there is significant uncertainty with respect to when commercial air traffic levels will begin to recover, and whether and at what point capacity will return to and/or exceed pre-COVID-19 levels. Our latest estimates are that this recovery may occur in 2023 or 2024. New information may emerge concerning the 34 Table of C ontents scope, severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as any worsening of the pandemic, the effect of mutating strains and whether additional outbreaks of the pandemic will continue to occur, actions to contain the pandemic’s spread or treat its impact, timing of the availability of vaccines, and their distribution, acceptance and efficacy, and governmental, business and individual personal actions taken in response to the pandemic (including restrictions and limitations on travel and transportation, and changes in leisure and business travel patterns and work environments) among others. Some of these actions and related impacts may be trends that continue in the future even after the pandemic no longer poses a significant public health risk. We considered the deterioration in general economic and market conditions primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic to be a triggering event in the first and second quarters of 2020, requiring an impairment evaluation of goodwill, intangible assets and other assets in our commercial aerospace businesses, Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney. Beginning in the second quarter of 2020, we observed several airline customer bankruptcies, delays and cancellations of aircraft purchases by airlines, fleet retirements and repositioning of OEM production schedules and we experienced a significant decline in revenues at our Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney businesses due to a decline in flight hours, aircraft fleet utilization, shop visits and commercial OEM deliveries. These factors contributed to a deterioration of our expectations regarding the timing of a return to pre-COVID-19 commercial flight activity, which further reduced our future sales and cash flows expectations. Based on our updated forecast assumptions in the second quarter of 2020, we concluded that the carrying values of two of our Collins Aerospace reporting units were greater than their respective fair values, and accordingly, recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $3.2 billion. We did not identify any further deterioration to our expectations in the third quarter of 2020 and, therefore, did not have a triggering event. We completed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of October 1, 2020 and determined that no additional adjustments to the carrying value of our goodwill were necessary. Refer to “Note 2: Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. As described further in “Note 8: Commercial Aerospace Industry Assets and Commitments” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K, we have significant exposure related to our airline and airframer customers, including significant accounts receivable and contract assets balances. Given the uncertainty related to the severity and length of the pandemic, as well as any worsening of the pandemic, mutations to the strains of the virus and the timing and impact of vaccines and whether there will be additional outbreaks of the pandemic and its impact across the aerospace industry, we may be required to record additional charges or impairments in future periods. For a discussion on the 2020 impacts see “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Although the impact of COVID-19 on our commercial business is significant, we currently believe we have sufficient liquidity to withstand the current estimated impacts. Other Matters Global economic and political conditions, changes in raw material and commodity prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, energy costs, levels of air travel, the financial condition of commercial airlines, and the impact from natural disasters and weather conditions create uncertainties that could impact our businesses in 2021. With regard to political conditions, in July 2019, the U.S. government suspended Turkey’s participation in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program because Turkey accepted delivery of the Russian-built S-400 air and missile defense system. The U.S. has imposed, and may impose additional, sanctions on Turkey as a result of this or other political disputes. Turkish companies supply us with components, some of which are sole-sourced, primarily in our aerospace operations for commercial and military engines and aerospace products. Depending upon the scope and timing of U.S. sanctions on Turkey and potential reciprocal actions, if any, such sanctions or actions could impact our sources of supply and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. In addition, in October 2020, the People’s Republic of China (China) announced that it may sanction RTC in connection with a possible Foreign Military Sale to Taiwan of six MS-110 Reconnaissance Pods and related equipment manufactured by Collins Aerospace. Foreign Military Sales are government-to-government transactions that are initiated by, and carried out at the direction of, the U.S. government. To date, the Chinese government has not imposed sanctions on RTC or indicated the nature or timing of any future potential sanctions or other actions. If China were to impose sanctions or take other regulatory action against RTC, our suppliers, teammates or partners, it could potentially disrupt our business operations. The impact of potential sanctions or other actions by China cannot be determined at this time. The recent U.S. presidential and congressional election could result in changes to the U.S. government’s foreign policies that may impact regulatory approval for direct commercial sales contracts for certain of our products and services to certain foreign customers. Likewise, it is uncertain whether approvals previously granted for prior sales could also be paused or revoked if the products and services have not yet been delivered to the customer. If we ultimately do not receive all of the regulatory approvals, or those approvals are revoked, it could have a material effect on our financial results. 35 Table of C ontents In particular, we have direct commercial sales contracts for precision guided munitions with a certain Middle East customer, for which we have not yet obtained regulatory approval. Due to the result of the U.S. presidential and congressional election, and the resulting uncertainty surrounding U.S. foreign policy on direct commercial sales for precision guided munitions with this customer, we determined that it is no longer probable that we will be able to obtain required regulatory approvals for these contracts; however, this determination could change as the U.S. government’s foreign policy views are clarified. Therefore, in the fourth quarter of 2020, we reversed $119 million of sales for work performed on these specific contracts subsequent to the date of the Raytheon Merger and through the end of the third quarter of 2020, and the related operating profit. In addition, we recognized an unfavorable profit impact of $516 million, primarily related to inventory reserves, contract asset impairments and recognition of supplier related obligations related to termination liability, which we now do not expect to be utilized or otherwise directed to other customers. In addition, we reversed $755 million of backlog on these contracts. Our contract liabilities include $405 million of advance payments received from the customer on these contracts, which may become refundable to the customer if the contracts are ultimately terminated. See Item 1A. Risk Factors within Part I of this Form 10-K for further discussion of these items. FINANCIAL SUMMARY We use the following key financial performance measures to manage our business on a consolidated basis and by business segment, and to monitor and assess our results of operations: – Net Sales—a growth metric that measures our revenue for the current year; – Operating Profit—a measure of our profit from continuing operations for the year, before non-operating expenses, net and income taxes; and – Operating Margin—a measure of our operating profit as a percentage of total net sales. (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Total net sales $ 56,587 $ 45,349 $ 34,701 Operating profit (loss) (1,889) 4,914 2,877 Operating margin (3.3) % 10.8 % 8.3 % Operating cash flow from continuing operations $ 4,334 $ 5,821 $ 2,670 Total backlog 150,119 111,665 93,844 Backlog, which is equivalent to our remaining performance obligations for our contracts, represents the dollar value of firm orders for which work has not been performed and excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering-type contracts (e.g., indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) type contracts). Backlog generally increases with bookings and/or orders and generally converts into sales as we incur costs under the related contractual commitments for our contracts recognized over time or as products are transferred to our customers for point in time contracts. Backlog is affected by changes in foreign exchange rates. In addition, we maintain a strong focus on program execution and the prudent management of capital and investments in order to maximize operating income and cash. We focus on adjusted earnings per share (EPS) and measures to assess our cash generation and the efficiency and effectiveness of our use of capital, such as free cash flow (FCF) and return on invested capital (ROIC), all of which are not defined measurements under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and may be calculated differently by other companies. Considered together, we believe these metrics are strong indicators of our overall performance and our ability to create shareowner value. We feel these measures are balanced among long-term and short-term performance, efficiency and growth. We also use these and other performance metrics for executive compensation purposes. A discussion of our results of operations and financial condition follows below in Results of Operations, Segment Review, and Liquidity and Financial Condition. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS As described in our “Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results” in this Form 10-K, our period-to-period comparisons of our results, particularly at a segment level, may not be indicative of our future operating results. The following discussions of comparative results among periods, including the discussion of segment results, should be viewed in this context. As discussed further above in “Business Overview,” the results of RIS and RMD reflect the period subsequent to the completion of the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020. In addition, as a result of the Separations Transactions and the 36 Table of C ontents Distributions, the historical results of Carrier and Otis are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Net Sales (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Net sales $ 56,587 $ 45,349 $ 34,701 The factors contributing to the total change year-over-year in total net sales are as follows: (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 Organic (1) $ (10,438) $ 2,351 Foreign currency translation 14 (73) Acquisitions and divestitures, net 21,662 8,370 Other — — Total Change $ 11,238 $ 10,648 (1) We provide the organic change in net sales for our consolidated results of operations. We believe that this measure is useful to investors because it provides transparency to the underlying performance of our business, which allows for better year-over-year comparability. The organic change excludes the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; acquisitions and divestitures, net; and other significant non-recurring and non-operational items. A reconciliation of this measure to reported U.S. GAAP amounts is provided in the table above. Net sales decreased $10,438 million organically in 2020 compared to 2019. This decrease reflects lower organic sales of $6.6 billion at Collins Aerospace, primarily driven by lower commercial aerospace OEM sales and lower commercial aerospace aftermarket sales, partially offset by higher military sales. The declines in commercial aerospace OEM sales and commercial aerospace aftermarket sales were primarily due to the current economic environment principally driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in lower flight hours, aircraft fleet utilization and commercial OEM deliveries. The decrease in net sales also reflects lower organic sales of $4.1 billion at Pratt & Whitney primarily due to lower commercial aftermarket sales due to a significant reduction in shop visits and related spare part sales, and lower commercial OEM sales, primarily due to a significant reduction in commercial engine deliveries, all principally driven by the current economic and operating environment primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The decrease at Pratt & Whitney was partially offset by higher military sales primarily driven by an increase in F135 engine sales and aftermarket growth on multiple platforms. The $21,662 million sales increase in Acquisitions and divestitures, net in 2020 compared to 2019, is primarily driven by the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020. Included in the change in Acquisitions and divestitures, net was the sale of the Collins Aerospace military Global Positioning System (GPS) and space-based precision optics businesses sold in the third quarter of 2020, as further discussed in “Note 2: Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Net sales increased $2,351 million organically in 2019 compared to 2018. This increase reflects higher organic sales of $1.6 billion at Pratt & Whitney, primarily driven by higher military, commercial OEM, and commercial aftermarket sales. The increase in net sales also reflects higher organic sales of $1.1 billion at Collins Aerospace primarily driven by higher commercial aftermarket and military sales, partially offset by lower commercial aerospace OEM sales. The $8,370 million sales increase in Acquisitions and divestitures, net in 2019 compared to 2018, is primarily driven by the Rockwell Acquisition. The composition of external net sales by products and services sales for 2020 was approximately the following: Collins Aerospace Systems Pratt & Whitney Raytheon Intelligence & Space Raytheon Missiles & Defense Products 80 % 60 % 75 % 90 % Services 20 % 40 % 25 % 10 % % of Total Net Sales (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 2020 2019 2018 Net Sales Products $ 43,319 $ 32,998 $ 24,141 77 % 73 % 70 % Services 13,268 12,351 10,560 23 % 27 % 30 % Total net sales $ 56,587 $ 45,349 $ 34,701 100 % 100 % 100 % Net products sales grew $10,321 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to an increase in external product sales of $18.4 billion due to the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020, partially offset by decreases in external product sales of $5.3 billion 37 Table of C ontents at Collins Aerospace and $2.8 billion at Pratt & Whitney. Net services sales grew $917 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to an increase in external services sales of $3.4 billion due to the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020, partially offset by decreases in external services sales of $1.3 billion at Pratt & Whitney and $1.2 billion at Collins Aerospace. Net products sales grew $8,857 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to an increase in external product sales of $7.3 billion at Collins Aerospace principally driven by the Rockwell Acquisition and an increase in external product sales of $1.6 billion at Pratt & Whitney. Net services sales grew $1,791 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to an increase in external services sales of $1.9 billion at Collins Aerospace primarily due to the Rockwell Acquisition. Our sales to major customers were as follows: % of Total Net Sales (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 2020 2019 2018 Sales to the U.S. government (1) $ 25,962 $ 9,094 $ 6,560 46 % 20 % 19 % Foreign military sales through the U.S. government 4,585 1,571 902 8 % 3 % 3 % Foreign government direct commercial sales 3,974 1,498 1,275 7 % 3 % 4 % Commercial aerospace and other commercial sales 22,066 33,186 25,964 39 % 73 % 75 % Total net sales $ 56,587 $ 45,349 $ 34,701 100 % 100 % 100 % (1) Excludes foreign military sales through the U.S. government. Cost of Products and Services Sold (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Total cost of products and services sold $ 48,056 $ 34,598 $ 27,465 Percentage of net sales 85 % 76 % 79 % The factors contributing to the change year-over-year in total cost of products and services sold are as follows: (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 Organic (1) $ (4,432) $ 1,781 Foreign currency translation 8 (125) Acquisitions and divestitures, net 17,696 5,241 Restructuring 220 89 FAS/CAS operating adjustment (965) — Acquisition accounting adjustments 939 424 Other (8) (277) Total Change $ 13,458 $ 7,133 (1) We provide the organic change in cost of sales for our consolidated results of operations. We believe that this measure is useful to investors because it provides transparency to the underlying performance of our business, which allows for better year-over-year comparability. The organic change excludes the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; acquisitions and divestitures, net; restructuring costs; costs related to certain acquisition accounting adjustments and other significant non-recurring and non-operational items. A reconciliation of this measure to reported U.S. GAAP amounts is provided in the table above. The organic decrease in total cost of products and services sold in 2020 compared to 2019 of $4,432 million was primarily driven by the organic sales decreases noted above. The increase in Acquisitions and divestitures, net of $17,696 million in 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily driven by the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020. Included in the change in Acquisitions and divestitures, net is the sale of the Collins Aerospace military GPS and space-based precision optics businesses sold in the third quarter of 2020, as further discussed in “Note 2: Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K and an unfavorable profit impact of $516 million related to inventory reserves, contract asset impairments and recognition of supplier related obligations for certain international contracts at RMD as further described in “Segment Review” below. Included in the decrease in Other of $8 million in 2020 compared to 2019 was prior year amortization of inventory fair value step-up associated with the Rockwell Collins acquisition of $181 million at Collins Aerospace, partially offset by an $89 million impairment of commercial aircraft program assets at Pratt & Whitney in the current year. The organic increase in total cost of products and services sold in 2019 compared to 2018, of $1,781 million was primarily driven by the organic sales increases noted above. The increase in Acquisitions and divestitures, net of $5,241 million for 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily driven by the Rockwell Acquisition. The decrease in Other of $277 million primarily reflects the absence of a 2018 customer contract settlement at Pratt & Whitney. 38 Table of C ontents For further discussion on Restructuring costs see “Restructuring Costs” section below. For further discussion on FAS/CAS operating adjustment see “FAS/CAS operating adjustment” section below.

Net services cost of sales grew $2,231 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to an increase in external services cost of sales due to the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020, partially offset by a decrease in external services cost of sales at Collins Aerospace. Net products cost of sales grew $5,827 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to an increase in external product cost of sales at Collins Aerospace, primarily due to the Rockwell Acquisition, and at Pratt & Whitney. Net services cost of sales grew $1,306 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to an increase in external services cost of sales at Collins Aerospace primarily due to the Rockwell Acquisition. Research and Development (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Company-funded $ 2,582 $ 2,452 $ 1,878 Percentage of net sales 4.6 % 5.4 % 5.4 % Customer-funded (1) $ 4,111 $ 2,283 $ 1,517 Percentage of net sales 7.3 % 5.0 % 4.4 % (1) Customer-funded research and development costs are included in cost of sales in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Research and development spending is subject to the variable nature of program development schedules and, therefore, year-over-year fluctuations in spending levels are expected. The increase in company-funded research and development of $130 million in 2020 compared to 2019, was primarily driven by $0.6 billion related to the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020, partially offset by lower expenses of $0.3 billion across various commercial programs at Pratt & Whitney and $0.2 billion across various commercial programs at Collins Aerospace, both principally driven by cost reduction measures in response to the current economic environment primarily due to COVID-19. The increase in company-funded research and development of $574 million in 2019 compared to 2018, was primarily driven by $0.5 billion related to the Rockwell Acquisition. Excluding this impact, Collins Aerospace company-funded research and development increased $0.1 billion driven by higher expenses across various commercial programs. The increase in customer-funded research and development of $1,828 million in 2020 compared to 2019, was primarily driven by $1.7 billion related to the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020. The increase in customer-funded research and development of $766 million in 2019 compared to 2018, was primarily driven by $0.8 billion related to the Rockwell Acquisition. Selling, General and Administrative (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Selling, general and administrative $ 5,540 $ 3,711 $ 2,864 Percentage of net sales 9.8 % 8.2 % 8.3 % Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $1,829 million in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily driven by $1.6 billion related to the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020, excluding the impact of merger-related restructuring costs. The increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses also includes higher expenses of $0.4 billion related to increased estimates of expected credit losses primarily due to customer bankruptcies and additional allowances for credit losses at Pratt & Whitney and Collins Aerospace, higher general and administrative restructuring costs of $0.3 billion, and lower expenses due to cost reduction initiatives. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $847 million in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily driven by $0.6 billion of incremental selling, general and administrative expenses resulting from the Rockwell Acquisition and $0.1 billion of costs 39 Table of C ontents associated with the Raytheon Merger. The increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses also includes higher expenses of $0.2 billion at Collins Aerospace, primarily driven by increased headcount and employee compensation related expenses partially offset by synergy capture related to the Rockwell Acquisition. We are continuously evaluating our cost structure and have implemented restructuring actions in an effort to keep our cost structure competitive. As appropriate, the amounts reflected above include the beneficial impact of previous restructuring actions on Selling, general and administrative expenses. See “Note 14: Restructuring Costs” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K and Restructuring Costs, below, for further discussion. Other Income, Net (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Other income, net $ 885 $ 326 $ 383 Other income, net includes equity earnings in unconsolidated entities, royalty income, foreign exchange gains and losses, as well as other ongoing and nonrecurring items. The increase in Other income, net of $559 million in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to $595 million of gains on the sales of the Collins Aerospace businesses, as further discussed in “Note 2: Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K, and $225 million related to foreign government wage subsidies due to COVID-19 at Pratt & Whitney and Collins Aerospace, partially offset by a net unfavorable year-over-year impact of foreign exchange gains and losses of $138 million. The decrease in Other income, net of $57 million in 2019 compared to 2018, was primarily due to a net unfavorable impact of foreign exchange gains and losses. Operating Profit (Loss) (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Operating profit (loss) $ (1,889) $ 4,914 $ 2,877 Operating profit (loss) margin (3.3) % 10.8 % 8.3 % The change in Operating profit (loss) of $6,803 million in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily driven by the operating performance at our segments as described below in “Segment Review” and the $3,183 million goodwill impairment in the second quarter of 2020 related to two Collins Aerospace reporting units. Included in the change in Operating profit (loss) was an increase in acquisition accounting adjustments of $1,057 million related to the Raytheon Merger, an increase in restructuring costs of $527 million primarily related to restructuring actions taken at our Collins Aerospace segment and restructuring actions in connection with the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020 and an unfavorable profit impact of $516 million related to inventory reserves, contract asset impairments and recognition of supplier related obligations for certain international contracts at RMD as further described in “Segment Review” below. The increase in Operating profit (loss) of $2,037 million in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily driven by operating performance at our segments as described below in “Segment Review.” Included in the increase in Operating profit (loss) was an increase in acquisition accounting adjustments of $375 million primarily related to the Rockwell acquisition and increase in restructuring costs of $93 million primarily related to actions taken at our Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney segments. Non-service Pension (Income) Expense (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Non-service pension (income) expense $ (902) $ (829) $ (659) The change in Non-service pension (income) expense of $73 million in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily driven by the inclusion of Raytheon Company plans in 2020 as a result of the Raytheon Merger and a decrease in the interest rates at December 31, 2019 and during 2020 compared to December 31, 2018, partially offset by a decrease in the expected return on plan assets (EROA) assumption for the UTC plans in 2020 and a one-time curtailment gain of $98 million in 2019. The one-time curtailment gain was due to the recognition of previously unrecognized prior service credits as a result of an amendment to the UTC domestic defined benefit plans to cease accrual of additional benefits for future service and compensation for non-union participants effective December 31, 2019. The change in Non-service pension (income) expense of $170 million in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily driven the inclusion of Rockwell Collins plans in 2019 as a result of the Rockwell Collins acquisition and a one-time curtailment gain of $98 million in 2019. 40 Table of C ontents Interest Expense, Net (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Interest expense $ 1,408 $ 1,711 $ 1,182 Interest income (42) (120) (150) Interest expense, net $ 1,366 $ 1,591 $ 1,032 Average interest expense rate - average outstanding borrowings during the year: Short-term borrowings 2.0 % 1.7 % 1.3 % Total debt 4.0 % 3.6 % 3.5 % Average interest expense rate - outstanding borrowings as of December 31: Short-term borrowings 0.6 % 2.3 % 1.9 % Total debt 4.2 % 3.6 % 3.5 % Interest expense, net decreased $225 million in 2020 as compared with 2019, primarily due to a decrease in interest expense principally driven by the repayment of long-term debt, partially offset by a decrease in interest income principally driven by interest income of $63 million related to tax settlements in the prior year. The average maturity of our long-term debt at December 31, 2020 was approximately 14 years. Interest expense, net increased $559 million in 2019 as compared with 2018, primarily due to an increase in interest expense driven by debt acquired from the Rockwell Acquisition and the impact of the August 16, 2018 issuance of notes representing $11 billion in aggregate principal amount. The average maturity of our long-term debt at December 31, 2019 was approximately 10 years. Income Taxes 2020 2019 2018 Effective income tax rate (24.4) % 10.1 % 43.8 % The 2020 negative effective tax rate is a result of having tax expense of $575 million on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $2,353 million. The loss from continuing operations before income taxes includes the $3,183 million goodwill impairment as described in “Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets,” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K, most of which is non-deductible for tax purposes. Tax expense includes net deferred tax charges of $367 million resulting from the Separation Transactions and the Raytheon Merger primarily related to the impairment of deferred tax assets, and incremental tax expense of $177 million related to the disposal of businesses, including the sales of the Collins Aerospace and RIS businesses and the entry into a definitive agreement to sell Forcepoint, as described in “Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. As a result of the Separation Transactions and the restructuring charges recognized in 2020, tax expense also includes $49 million related to revaluation of the tax benefit for certain international tax incentives, as the Company no longer expects to meet the incentive requirements. Also included in the 2020 effective tax rate are tax benefits of $142 million associated with U.S. research and development credits and $83 million associated with Foreign Derived Intangible Income (FDII). The 2019 effective tax rate includes tax benefits of $290 million primarily associated with the conclusion of the audit by the Examination Division of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the Company’s 2014, 2015 and 2016 tax years and the filing by a subsidiary of the Company to participate in an amnesty program offered by the Italian Tax Authority. The 2019 effective tax rate also includes tax benefits of $138 million associated with FDII and $101 million related to U.S. research and development credits. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) was enacted. The 2018 effective tax rate reflects a net charge of $744 million for TCJA related adjustments. The amount primarily relates to non-U.S. taxes that will become due when previously reinvested earnings of certain international subsidiaries are remitted. The 2018 effective tax rate also includes tax benefits of $102 million associated with FDII and $73 million related to U.S. research & development credits. For additional discussion of income taxes and the effective income tax rate, see “Income Taxes” within Critical Accounting Estimates, below, and “Note 13: Income Taxes” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 41 Table of C ontents Net Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations Attributable to Common Shareowners (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2020 2019 2018 Net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners $ (3,109) $ 3,510 $ 1,216 Diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations $ (2.29) $ 4.06 $ 1.50 Net loss from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners for 2020 includes the following: • acquisition accounting adjustments primarily related to the Raytheon Merger of $1,435 million, net of tax, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $1.06; • restructuring charges of $598 million, net of tax, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.44; • $3,240 million of primarily non-deductible goodwill and intangibles impairment charges related to our Collins Aerospace segment, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $2.37; • significant unfavorable contract adjustments at Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney of $667 million, net of tax, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.49; • $415 million of tax charges in connection with the Separation Transactions, including the impairment of deferred tax assets not expected to be utilized, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.31; • unfavorable profit impact at RMD of $412 million, net of tax, related to certain direct commercial sales contracts for precision guided munitions with a certain Middle East customer, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.30; • increased estimates of expected credit losses driven by customer bankruptcies and additional allowances for credit losses of $300 million, net of tax, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.22; and • gains on the sales of the Collins Aerospace businesses of $240 million, net of tax, which had a favorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.18. Net income from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners for 2019 includes the following: • acquisition accounting adjustments of $704 million, net of tax, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.81; • restructuring charges of $186 million, net of tax, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.21; • tax settlements and related interest income on tax settlements of $341 million, which had a favorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.39; and • amortization on the inventory fair value step-up associated with the Rockwell Acquisition of $140 million, net of tax, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.16. Net income from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners for 2018 includes the following: • acquisition accounting adjustments of $432 million, net of tax, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.53; • restructuring charges of $114 million, net of tax, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.14; • an income tax charge related to the estimated impact of the TCJA of $744 million, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.92; and • the unfavorable impact of customer contract matters at Pratt & Whitney of $220 million, net of tax, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.27. Net Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations Attributable to Common Shareowners (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2020 2019 2018 Net income (loss) from discontinued operations attributable to common shareowners $ (410) $ 2,027 $ 4,053 Diluted earnings (loss) per share from discontinued operations $ (0.30) $ 2.35 $ 5.00 On April 3, 2020, we completed the separation of our commercial businesses, Carrier and Otis. Effective as of such date, the historical results of the Carrier and Otis segments have been reclassified to discontinued operations for all periods presented. See “Note 3: Discontinued Operations” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. The change in net income (loss) from discontinued operations attributable to common shareowners of $2,437 million and the related change in diluted earnings (loss) per share from discontinued operations of $2.65 in 2020 compared to 2019 was 42 Table of C ontents primarily due to prior year Carrier and Otis operating activity, as the Separation Transactions occurred on April 3, 2020, partially offset by higher prior year costs associated with the separation of our commercial businesses as discussed below. Net income (loss) from discontinued operations for 2020 and 2019 includes $888 million, net of tax, and $1,284 million, net of tax, respectively, of costs associated with the Company’s separation of its commercial businesses. Separation costs in 2020 primarily related to debt extinguishment costs of $611 million in connection with the early repayment of outstanding principal. The change in net income (loss) from discontinued operations attributable to common shareowners of $2,026 million and the related change in diluted earnings (loss) per share from discontinued operations of $2.65 in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to the increased costs associated with the separation of our commercial businesses in 2019 and the absence of a gain on Carrier’s sale of Taylor Company of $591 million, net of tax in 2018. Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Common Shareowners (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2020 2019 2018 Net income (loss) attributable to common shareowners $ (3,519) $ 5,537 $ 5,269 Diluted earnings (loss) per share from operations $ (2.59) $ 6.41 $ 6.50 The change in net income (loss) attributable to common shareowners and diluted EPS from operations for 2020 compared to 2019 was driven by the decrease in continuing operations, as discussed above in Net Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations Attributable to Common Shareowners and the decrease from discontinued operations, as discussed above in Net Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations Attributable to Common Shareowners. The change in net income (loss) attributable to common shareowners and diluted EPS from operations for 2019 compared to 2018 was driven by the increase in continuing operations, as discussed above in Net Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations Attributable to Common Shareowners, partially offset by the decrease from discontinued operations, as discussed above in Net Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations Attributable to Common Shareowners. RESTRUCTURING COSTS (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Restructuring costs $ 777 $ 245 $ 158 Restructuring actions are an essential component of our operating margin improvement efforts and relate to existing and recently acquired operations. Charges generally arise from severance related to workforce reductions and facility exit costs associated with the consolidation of field and manufacturing operations and costs to exit legacy programs. We continue to closely monitor the economic environment and may undertake further restructuring actions to keep our cost structure aligned with the demands of the prevailing market conditions. 2020 Actions. During 2020, we recorded net pre-tax restructuring charges of $770 million for restructuring efforts initiated in 2020, primarily related to severance and restructuring actions at Pratt & Whitney and Collins Aerospace in response to the impact on our operating results related to the current economic environment primarily caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Raytheon Merger, and the ongoing cost reduction efforts. We expect to incur additional restructuring and other charges of $40 million to complete these actions. We are targeting to complete in 2021 the majority of actions initiated in 2020. We expect recurring pre-tax savings in continuing operations related to these actions to reach approximately $1.1 billion annually within one to two years. Approximately 80% of the total pre-tax charge will require cash payments, which we have funded and expect to continue to fund with cash generated from operations. During 2020, we had cash outflows of approximately $400 million related to the 2020 actions. 2019 Actions. During 2020 and 2019, we recorded net pre-tax restructuring charges of $10 million and $162 million, respectively, for actions initiated in 2019. We expect to incur additional restructuring charges of $58 million to complete these actions. We are targeting to complete in 2021 the majority of the remaining workforce and all facility related cost reduction actions initiated in 2019. We expect annual recurring pre-tax savings in continuing operations related to these actions to reach approximately $200 million annually within two years of initiating these actions. Approximately 90% of the total pre-tax charge will require cash payments, which we have funded and expect to continue to fund with cash generated from operations. During 2020, we had cash outflows of approximately $40 million related to the 2019 actions. In addition, during 2020, we reversed $3 million of net pre-tax restructuring costs for restructuring actions initiated in 2018 and prior. In 2019 and 2018, we recorded $83 million and $158 million, respectively, of net pre-tax restructuring costs for restructuring actions initiated in 2018 and prior. For additional discussion of restructuring, see “Note 14: Restructuring Costs” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. 43 Table of C ontents SEGMENT REVIEW A s discussed further above in Business Overview, o n April 3, 2020, United Technologies Corporation (UTC) completed the Separation Transactions, and on April 3, 2020, completed the Raytheon Merger with United Technologies Corporation being renamed Raytheon Technologies Corporation. As a result of these transactions, we now operate in four principal business segments: Collins Aerospace Systems (Collins Aerospace), Pratt & Whitney, Raytheon Intelligence & Space (RIS) and Raytheon Missiles & Defense (RMD). The results of RIS and RMD reflect the period subsequent to the completion of the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020. The historical results of Carrier and Otis are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. For a detailed description of our businesses, see “Business” within Item 1 of this Form 10-K. In conjunction with the Raytheon Merger, we revised our measurement of segment performance to reflect how management now reviews and evaluates operating performance. Under the new segment performance measurement, certain acquisition accounting adjustments are now excluded from segments’ results in order to better represent the ongoing operational performance of those segments. In addition, the majority of Corporate expenses are now allocated to the segments, excluding certain items that remain at Corporate because they are not included in management’s review of the segments’ results. Historical results, discussion and presentation of our business segments reflect the impact of these adjustments for all periods presented. Also as a result of the Raytheon Merger, we now present a FAS/CAS operating adjustment outside of segment results, which represents the difference between the service cost component of our pension and postretirement benefit (PRB) expense under the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) requirements of U.S. GAAP and our pension and PRB expense under U.S. government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) primarily related to our RIS and RMD segments. While the ultimate liability for pension and PRB costs under FAS and CAS is similar, the pattern of cost recognition is different. Over time we generally expect to recover the related RIS and RMD pension and PRB liabilities through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government. Because the Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney segments generally record pension and PRB expense on a FAS basis, historical results were not impacted by this change in segment reporting. Segments are generally based on the management structure of the businesses and the grouping of similar operations, based on capabilities and technologies, where each management organization has general operating autonomy over diversified products and services. Segment total net sales and operating profit include intercompany sales and profit, which are ultimately eliminated within Eliminations and other, which also includes certain smaller non-reportable segments. For our defense contracts, where the primary customer is the U.S. government subject to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) part 12, our intercompany sales and profit is generally recorded at cost-plus a specified fee, which may differ from what the selling entity would be able to obtain on sales to external customers. Segment results exclude certain acquisition accounting adjustments, the FAS/CAS operating adjustment and certain corporate expenses, as further discussed below. We attempt to quantify material factors within our discussion of the results of each segment whenever those factors are determinable. However, in some instances, the factors we cite within our segment discussion are based upon input measures or qualitative information that does not lend itself to quantification when discussed in the context of the financial results measured on an output basis and are not, therefore, quantified in the below discussions. Given the nature of our business, we believe that total net sales and operating profit (and the related operating profit margin percentage), which we disclose and discuss at the segment level, are most relevant to an understanding of management’s view of our segment performance, as described below. Total Net Sales. Total net sales by segment were as follows: (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Collins Aerospace Systems $ 19,288 $ 26,028 $ 16,634 Pratt & Whitney 16,799 20,902 19,402 Raytheon Intelligence & Space 10,841 — — Raytheon Missiles & Defense 11,660 — — Total segment 58,588 46,930 36,036 Eliminations and other (2,001) (1,581) (1,335) Consolidated $ 56,587 $ 45,349 $ 34,701 44 Table of C ontents Operating Profit (Loss). Operating profit (loss) by segment was as follows: (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Collins Aerospace Systems $ 1,466 $ 4,508 $ 2,397 Pratt & Whitney (564) 1,801 1,402 Raytheon Intelligence & Space 1,014 — — Raytheon Missiles & Defense 890 — — Total segment 2,806 6,309 3,799 Eliminations and other (111) (140) (69) Corporate expenses and other unallocated items (590) (367) (340) FAS/CAS operating adjustment 1,106 — — Acquisition accounting adjustments (1) (5,100) (888) (513) Consolidated $ (1,889) $ 4,914 $ 2,877 (1) Acquisition accounting adjustments in 2020 includes the $3.2 billion goodwill impairment loss in the second quarter of 2020 related to two Collins Aerospace reporting units. Refer to “Note 2: Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets” in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. Included in segment operating profit are Estimate at Completion (EAC) adjustments, which relate to changes in operating profit and margin due to revisions to total estimated revenues and costs at completion. These changes reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance or award fee rates. For a full description of our EAC process, refer to “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Given that we have thousands of individual contracts and given the types and complexity of the assumptions and estimates we must make on an on-going basis, we have both favorable and unfavorable EAC adjustments. We had the following aggregate EAC adjustments for the periods presented: (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Gross favorable $ 994 $ 419 $ 579 Gross unfavorable (1,637) (488) (629) Total net EAC adjustments $ (643) $ (69) $ (50) As a result of the Raytheon Merger, RIS’s and RMD’s long-term contracts that are accounted for on a percentage of completion basis, were reset to zero percent complete as of the merger date since only the unperformed portion of the contract at the merger date represents an obligation of the Company. This has had the impact of reducing gross favorable and unfavorable EAC adjustments for these segments in the short-term, with the exception of EAC adjustments related to loss reserves. The change in net EAC adjustments of $574 million in 2020 compared 2019 was primarily due to an increase in net unfavorable EAC adjustments of $544 million at Pratt & Whitney, principally due to the current economic and operating environment primarily driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Net EAC adjustments in 2019 were relatively consistent with 2018. Significant EAC adjustments in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are discussed in each business segment’s discussion below. Refer to the individual segment results for further information. Defense Backlog and Defense Bookings. We believe defense backlog and defense bookings are relevant to an understanding of management’s view of our defense operations’ performance. Our defense operations consist primarily of our RIS and RMD businesses and operations in the defense businesses within our Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney segments. Defense backlog was approximately $67.3 billion and $22.3 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, out of total backlog, including commercial, of $150.1 billion and $111.7 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Defense bookings were approximately $31.2 billion, $16.9 billion and $14.1 billion for 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively. Defense backlog, which is equivalent to our remaining performance obligations for our defense contracts, represents the dollar value of firm orders for which work has not been performed and excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering-type contracts (e.g., IDIQ type contracts). Defense backlog is affected by changes in foreign exchange rates. Defense bookings generally represent the dollar value of new external defense contracts awarded to us during the reporting period and include firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated. We believe defense bookings are an important measure of future performance for our defense operations and are an indicator of potential future changes in these operations’ total net sales, because we cannot record revenues under a new contract without first having a booking in the current or a preceding period. Defense bookings exclude unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering-type contracts (e.g., IDIQ type contracts), and are reduced for contract cancellations and terminations of bookings recognized in the current period. We reflect contract cancellations and terminations from prior year bookings, as well as the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, 45 Table of C ontents directly as an adjustment to backlog in the period in which the cancellation or termination occurs and the impact is determinable. Contract cancellations and terminations also include contract underruns on cost-type programs. Defense bookings are impacted by the timing and amounts of awards in a given period, which are subject to numerous factors, including: (1) the desired capability by the customer and urgency of customer needs, (2) customer budgets and other fiscal constraints, (3) political and economic and other environmental factors, (4) the timing of customer negotiations, (5) the timing of governmental approvals and notifications, and (6) the timing of option exercises or increases in scope. In addition, due to these factors, quarterly bookings tend to fluctuate from period to period, particularly on a segment basis. As a result, we believe comparing bookings on a quarterly basis or for periods less than one year is less meaningful than for longer periods and that shorter term changes in bookings may not necessarily indicate a material trend. Collins Aerospace Systems % Change (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 2020 compared with 2019 2019 compared with 2018 Net Sales $ 19,288 $ 26,028 $ 16,634 (26) % 56 % Operating Profit 1,466 4,508 2,397 (67) % 88 % Operating Profit Margins 7.6 % 17.3 % 14.4 % 2020 Compared with 2019 Factors Contributing to Total Change (dollars in millions) Organic (1) FX Translation Acquisitions / Divestitures, net Restructuring Costs Other Total Change Net Sales $ (6,554) $ 15 $ (201) $ — $ — $ (6,740) Operating Profit (3,598) (1) $ (12) (258) 827 (3,042) 2019 Compared with 2018 Factors Contributing to Total Change (dollars in millions) Organic (1) FX Translation Acquisitions / Divestitures, net Restructuring Costs Other Total Change Net Sales $ 1,068 $ (72) $ 8,398 $ — $ — $ 9,394 Operating Profit 47 32 2,005 58 (31) 2,111 (1) We provide the organic change in net sales and operating profit for our Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney segments. We believe that these measures are useful to investors because they provide transparency to the underlying performance of our business, which allows for better year-over-year comparability. The organic change excludes the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; acquisitions and divestitures, net; restructuring costs and other significant non-recurring and non-operational items. A reconciliation of these measures to reported U.S. GAAP amounts is provided in the table above. 2020 Compared with 2019 The organic sales decrease of $6.6 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily relates to lower commercial aerospace OEM sales of $3.7 billion and lower commercial aerospace aftermarket sales of $3.4 billion, including declines across all aftermarket sales channels. These reductions were primarily due to the current economic environment principally driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in lower flight hours, aircraft fleet utilization and commercial OEM deliveries. This decrease was partially offset by higher military sales of $0.6 billion. Included in the organic sales decrease were lower commercial aerospace OEM and aftermarket sales of approximately $1.0 billion related to the Boeing 737 Max program and fewer upgrades due to certain regulatory mandates that were primarily completed in early 2020. The organic profit decrease of $3.6 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily due to lower commercial aerospace operating profit of $4.0 billion principally driven by the lower commercial aerospace OEM and aftermarket sales volume discussed above. Included in the lower commercial OEM operating profit were $157 million of significant unfavorable adjustments principally driven by the expected acceleration of fleet retirements of a certain aircraft. The decrease was partially offset by lower Research and development expenses of $0.2 billion, which includes the impact of cost reduction initiatives. Included in the operating profit decrease was $125 million of increased estimates of expected credit losses due to customer bankruptcies and additional allowances for credit losses. Included in organic profit in 2020 was other income of $72 million related to foreign government wage subsidies due to COVID-19 and $12 million related to the favorable impact of a contract related matter in the first quarter of 2020. 46 Table of C ontents The decrease in net sales and operating profit due to acquisitions / divestitures, net primarily relates to the sale of our Collins Aerospace military GPS and space-based precision optics businesses in the third quarter of 2020 as further discussed in “Note 2: Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The increase in Other operating profit of $0.8 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily relates to gains of $595 million on the sales of the Collins Aerospace businesses discussed above, the absence of prior year amortization of inventory fair value step-up associated with the Rockwell Acquisition of $181 million and the absence of a prior year loss on the sale of a business of $25 million. 2019 Compared with 2018 The organic sales increase of $1.1 billion in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily reflects higher commercial aerospace aftermarket s ales of $0.8 billion and higher military sales of $0.4 billion, partially offset by lower commercial aerospace OEM sales of $0.1 billion. Organic profit in 2019 was relatively consistent compared to 2018. Included in the change in organic profit was higher commercial aeros pace margin contribution of $0.2 billion driven by the commercial aftermarket sales growth noted above partially offset by lower commercial aerospace OEM margin contribution, and higher military margin contribution of $0.1 billion driven by the sales growth noted above. This increase was partially offset by higher Selling, general and administrative expenses of $0.2 billion and higher Research and development costs of $0.1 billion. The increase in net sales and operating profit due to acquisitions / divestitures, net primarily relates to the acquisition of Rockwell Collins in 2018 as further discussed in “Note 2: Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Pratt & Whitney % Change (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 2020 compared with 2019 2019 compared with 2018 Net Sales $ 16,799 $ 20,902 $ 19,402 (20) % 8 % Operating Profit (564) 1,801 1,402 (131) % 28 % Operating Profit Margins (3.4) % 8.6 % 7.2 % 2020 Compared with 2019 Factors Contributing to Total Change (dollars in millions) Organic (1) FX Translation (2) Acquisitions / Divestitures, net Restructuring Costs Other Total Change Net Sales $ (4,080) $ (23) $ — $ — $ — $ (4,103) Operating Profit (2,126) (5) — (47) (187) (2,365) 2019 Compared with 2018 Factors Contributing to Total Change (dollars in millions) Organic (1) FX Translation (2) Acquisitions / Divestitures, net Restructuring Costs Other Total Change Net Sales $ 1,576 $ (48) $ (28) $ — $ — $ 1,500 Operating Profit 228 (7) (7) (140) 325 399 (1) We provide the organic change in net sales and operating profit for our Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney segments. We believe that these measures are useful to investors because they provide transparency to the underlying performance of our business, which allows for better year-over-year comparability. The organic change excludes the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; acquisitions and divestitures, net; restructuring costs and other significant non-recurring and non-operational items. A reconciliation of these measures to reported U.S. GAAP amounts is provided in the table above. (2) For Pratt & Whitney only, the transactional impact of foreign exchange hedging at Pratt & Whitney Canada (P&WC) has been netted against the translational foreign exchange impact for presentation purposes in the table above. For all other segments these foreign exchange transactional impacts are included within the organic/operational caption in their respective tables. Due to its significance to Pratt & Whitney’s overall operating results, we believe it is useful to segregate the foreign exchange transactional impact in order to clearly identify the underlying financial performance. 2020 Compared with 2019 The organic sales decrease of $4.1 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily reflects lower commercial aftermarket sales of $3.8 billion, due to a significant reduction in shop visits and related spare part sales, and lower commercial OEM sales of $1.1 billion, primarily due to a significant reduction in commercial engine deliveries, all principally driven by the current 47 Table of C ontents economic and operating environment primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These declines were partially offset by higher military sales o f $0.8 billion primarily driven by an increase in F135 engine sales and aftermarket growth on multiple platforms. Included in the lower commercial aftermarket sales is a $0.4 billion impact to sales from the net unfavorable contract adjustments discussed further below. The organic profit decrease of $2.1 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily driven by lower commercial aftermarket operating profit of $2.4 billion driven by the sales volume decrease discussed above, unfavorable mix, a $334 million unfavorable EAC adjustment on a commercial engine aftermarket contract due to lower estimated revenues driven by a change in the estimated maintenance coverage period, an unfavorable EAC adjustment of $129 million related to lower estimated revenues due to the restructuring of a customer contract, and $86 million related to an unfavorable EAC adjustment and increased allowances for warranty for legacy fleet related retrofits. The decrease was also driven by higher Selling, general and administrative expenses of $0.2 billion primarily driven by $257 million of increased estimates of expected credit losses due to customer bankruptcies and additional allowances for credit losses. This decrease in organic profit was partially offset by lower Research and development costs of $0.3 billion, which includes the impact of cost reduction initiatives, and other income of $153 million related to foreign government wage subsidies due to COVID-19. Included in organic profit was an increase in net unfavorable EAC adjustments of $544 million, which included the unfavorable EAC adjustments discussed above and significant net unfavorable EAC adjustments of $62 million based on a portfolio review of our commercial aftermarket programs in the second quarter of 2020 in consideration of the estimated lower flight hours, a change in the estimated number of shop visits and the related amount of estimated costs. Also included was an unfavorable EAC adjustment of $44 million in the second quarter of 2020 on a military program primarily driven by a shift in estimated overhead costs due to the lower commercial engine activity discussed above. The decrease in Other operating profit of $187 million in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to an $89 million impairment of commercial aircraft program assets in the current year and $43 million of reserves related to a commercial financing arrangement in the current year. 2019 Compared with 2018 The organic sales increase of $1.6 billion primarily reflects higher military sales of $0.8 billion, higher commercial OEM sales of $0.5 billion, and higher commercial aftermarket sales of $0.2 billion. The organic profit increase of $0.2 billion was primarily driven by higher military margin contribution of $0.2 billion, driven by the sales increase noted above and higher commercial OEM margin contribution of $0.1 billion primarily driven by continued year-over-year cost reduction and favorable mix on large commercial engine shipments. These increases were partially offset by higher Research and development costs and Selling, general and administrative expenses of $0.1 billion. The $0.3 billion increase in Other operating profit primarily reflects the absence of a 2018 customer contract settlement. Raytheon Intelligence & Space % Change (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 2020 compared with 2019 2019 compared with 2018 Net Sales $ 10,841 — — NM NM Operating Profit 1,014 — — NM NM Operating Profit Margins 9.4 % — — Bookings $ 10,243 — — NM NM NM = Not meaningful The increase in net sales of $10,841 million in 2020 compared to 2019 was due to the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020. The increase in operating profit of $1,014 million and the related increase in operating profit margins in 2020 compared to 2019 was due to the Raytheon Merger. Included in operating profit in 2020 were $124 million of unfavorable EAC adjustments for loss reserves related to a domestic classified fixed price development program in a net loss position, of which $87 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020. Backlog and Bookings – Backlog was $18,676 million at December 31, 2020 compared to zero at December 31, 2019. The increase in backlog of $18,676 million was due to the Raytheon Merger. In 2020, RIS booked $3,294 million on a number of classified contracts, $236 million to produce and deliver Silent Knight radar systems and spares for the U.S. Special Operations Command, $229 million to perform operations and sustainment for the U.S. Air Force’s Launch and Test Range System (LTRS), $201 million on the Development, Operations and Maintenance (DOMino) cyber program for the Department of 48 Table of C ontents Homeland Security (DHS), $193 million on the Global Aircrew Strategic Network Terminal (Global ASNT) program for the U.S. Air Force, and $157 million for the Military GPS User Equipment Increment 2 Miniature Serial Interface Receiver Card (MGUE INC 2 MSI) program for the U.S. Air Force. Raytheon Missiles & Defense % Change (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 2020 compared with 2019 2019 compared with 2018 Net Sales $ 11,660 — — NM NM Operating Profit 890 — — NM NM Operating Profit Margins 7.6 % — — Bookings $ 10,041 — — NM NM NM = Not meaningful The increase in net sales of $11,660 million in 2020 compared to 2019 was due to the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020. The increase in operating profit of $890 million and the related increase in operating profit margins in 2020 compared to 2019 was due to the Raytheon Merger. Included in operating profit in 2020 was an unfavorable net impact of $516 million related to certain international contracts as further described below, and a $25 million net favorable EAC adjustment due to a revised estimate in costs to complete an industrial cooperation agreement obligation on multiple contracts for an international customer based upon an agreement signed in the fourth quarter of 2020. In the fourth quarter of 2020, RMD reversed $119 million of sales for work performed subsequent to the date of the Raytheon Merger through the end of the third quarter of 2020, and the related operating profit, on our direct commercial sales contracts for precision guided munitions with a certain Middle East customer, for which we have not yet obtained regulatory approval. As discussed in the “Other Matters” subsection of the “Business Overview” section above, due to the recent U.S. presidential and congressional election and the resulting uncertainty surrounding U.S. foreign policy on direct commercial sales for precision guided munitions with this customer, we determined that it is no longer probable that we will be able to obtain regulatory approvals for these contracts. RMD also recognized an unfavorable profit impact of $516 million related to these contracts, primarily related to inventory reserves, contract asset impairments and recognition of supplier related obligations related to termination liability, which we now do not expect to be utilized or otherwise directed to other customers. In addition, we reversed $755 million of backlog on these contracts. Backlog and Bookings – Backlog was $29,593 million at December 31, 2020 compared to zero at December 31, 2019. The increase in backlog of $29,593 million was due to the Raytheon Merger. In 2020, RMD booked $2,426 million on the Army Navy/Transportable Radar Surveillance-Model 2 (AN/TPY-2) radar program for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), $351 million for Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) for the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and an international customer, $340 million for StormBreaker for the U.S. Air Force, $268 million for the AN/TPY-2 radar sustainment program for the MDA, and $237 million for Tube-launched, Optically-tracked, Wireless-guided (TOW) missiles for the U.S. Army and international customers. RMD also booked $1,503 million on a number of classified contracts, including $354 million on a major contract. In 2020, RMD recorded a backlog adjustment of $755 million on certain international contracts as discussed above. Eliminations and other Eliminations and other reflects the elimination of sales, other income and operating profit transacted between segments, as well as the operating results of certain smaller non-reportable business segments, including Forcepoint, LLC, which was acquired as part of the Raytheon Merger and subsequently disposed of in January 2021, as further discussed in “Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Net Sales Operating Profit (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 2020 2019 2018 Inter-segment eliminations $ (2,528) $ (1,594) $ (1,347) $ (83) $ (208) $ (181) Other non-reportable segments 527 13 12 (28) 68 112 Eliminations and other $ (2,001) $ (1,581) $ (1,335) $ (111) $ (140) $ (69) The increase in inter-segment eliminations sales in 2020 compared to 2019, was primarily due to the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020. 49 Table of C ontents The increase in other non-reportable segment sales in 2020 compared to 2019, was primarily related to Forcepoint sales. The decrease in other non-reportable segments operating profit in 2020 compared to 2019, was primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by operating profit related to Forcepoint. Other non-reportable segment sales in 2019 were relatively consistent with 2018. The decrease in other non-reportable segments operating profit in 2019 compared to 2018, was primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation. Corporate expenses and other unallocated items Corporate expenses and other unallocated items consists of costs and certain other unallowable corporate costs not considered part of management’s evaluation of reportable segment operating performance including restructuring and merger costs related to the Raytheon Merger, net costs associated with corporate research and development, including the Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS) program which was acquired as part of the Raytheon Merger, and certain reserves. See Restructuring Costs, above, for a more detailed discussion of our restructuring costs. (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Corporate expenses and other unallocated items $ (590) $ (367) $ (340) The change in Corporate expenses and other unallocated items of $223 million for 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily driven by increased restructuring costs of $201 million, $130 million of net expenses related to the LTAMDS project acquired as part of the Raytheon Merger and an increase in merger-related costs for the Raytheon Merger of $82 million, partially offset by $40 million of merger-related costs for the Rockwell Acquisition in 2019 and other unallocated items with no individual or common significant driver. Corporate expenses and other unallocated items in 2019 was relatively consistent with 2018. Included in the change were merger-related costs for the Raytheon Merger of $83 million in 2019 and a decrease in merger-related costs for the Rockwell Acquisition of $78 million. FAS/CAS operating adjustment The segment results of RIS and RMD only include pension and PRB expense as determined under U.S. government CAS, which we generally recover through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government. The difference between our CAS expense and the FAS service cost attributable to these segments under U.S. GAAP is the FAS/CAS operating adjustment. The FAS/CAS operating adjustment results in consolidated pension expense in operating profit equal to the service cost component of FAS expense under U.S. GAAP. The segment results of Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney include FAS service cost. The pension and PRB components of the FAS/CAS operating adjustment were as follows: (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 FAS service cost (expense) $ (354) $ — $ — CAS expense 1,460 — — FAS/CAS operating adjustment $ 1,106 $ — $ — The change in our FAS/CAS operating adjustment of $1,106 million in 2020 compared to 2019 was due to the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020. Acquisition accounting adjustments Acquisition accounting adjustments include the amortization of acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions, the amortization of the property, plant and equipment fair value adjustment acquired through acquisitions and the amortization of customer contractual obligations related to loss making or below market contracts acquired. These adjustments are not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment results. 50 Table of C ontents The components of Acquisition accounting adjustments were as follows: (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Goodwill impairment charge $ (3,183) $ — $ — Amortization of acquired intangibles (2,142) (1,211) (689) Amortization of property, plant and equipment fair value adjustment (69) (23) (76) Amortization of customer contractual obligations related to acquired loss-making and below-market contracts 294 346 252 Acquisition accounting adjustments $ (5,100) $ (888) $ (513) Acquisition accounting adjustments related to acquisitions in each segment were as follows: (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Collins Aerospace Systems $ (3,926) $ (605) $ (235) Pratt & Whitney (117) (283) (278) Raytheon Intelligence & Space (394) — — Raytheon Missiles & Defense (607) — — Total segment (5,044) (888) (513) Eliminations and other (56) — — Acquisition accounting adjustments $ (5,100) $ (888) $ (513) The change in the Acquisition accounting adjustments of $4,212 million in 2020 compared to 2019, is primarily driven by the $3.2 billion goodwill impairment in the second quarter of 2020 related to two Collins Aerospace reporting units and an increase of $1.1 billion related to the Raytheon Merger, primarily related to the amortization of acquired intangibles. Refer to “Note 2: Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information on the goodwill impairment. The change in the Acquisition accounting adjustments of $375 million in 2019 compared to 2018, is primarily driven by a change of $370 million at Collins Aerospace primarily related to the Rockwell Acquisition. LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 Cash and cash equivalents $ 8,802 $ 4,937 Total debt 31,823 43,252 Total equity 73,852 44,231 Total capitalization (total debt plus total equity) 105,675 87,483 Total debt to total capitalization 30 % 49 % We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. Our principal source of liquidity is cash flows from operating activities. In addition to operating cash flows, other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include: capital expenditures, customer financing requirements, investments in businesses, dividends, common stock repurchases, pension funding, access to the commercial paper markets, adequacy of available bank lines of credit, redemptions of debt and the ability to attract long-term capital at satisfactory terms. We had $6.84 billion available under our various credit facilities at December 31, 2020. As discussed above in Business Overview, in response to the COVID-19, we have taken actions to preserve capital and protect the long-term needs of our business. Although our business has been and will continue to be significantly impacted by COVID-19, we currently believe we have sufficient liquidity to withstand the potential impacts. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), along with earlier issued IRS guidance, provides for a net deferral of payroll tax payments. We did not realize any cash flows benefit in 2020, and do not expect an impact to future years’ cash flows, from a net deferral of payroll tax payments. In addition, deferrals of required estimated federal, foreign and state income tax payments due to the CARES Act and other similar state and foreign stimulus incentives only impacted the timing of these payments within the year. The CARES Act, among other things, also contains numerous other provisions which may impact us. We continue to refine our understanding of the impact of the CARES Act on our business, and ongoing government guidance related to COVID-19 that may be issued . We may be entitled to recovery for certain costs through the 51 Table of C ontents pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government; however, we do not believe these costs are probable of recovery at this time, and therefore, have not assumed any recovery within our EACs. At December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $8.8 billion, of which approximately 45% was held by RTC’s foreign subsidiaries. We manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. The Company no longer intends to reinvest certain undistributed earnings of its international subsidiaries that have been previously taxed in the U.S. As such, we recorded the taxes associated with the future remittance of these earnings. For the remainder of the Company’s undistributed international earnings, unless tax effective to repatriate, RTC will continue to permanently reinvest these earnings. We repatriated $2.3 billion and $1.6 billion of cash for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. On occasion, we are required to maintain cash deposits with certain banks with respect to contractual obligations related to acquisitions or divestitures or other legal obligations. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the amount of such restricted cash was $30 million and $24 million respectively. Historically, our strong credit ratings and financial position have enabled us to issue long-term debt at favorable market rates. As of December 31, 2020, our maximum commercial paper borrowing limit was $5.0 billion as the commercial paper is backed by our $5.0 billion revolving credit agreement. We had $160 million of commercial paper borrowings as of December 31, 2020. The maximum amount of short-term commercial paper borrowings outstanding at any point in time during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $1,904 million. We use our commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes, including the funding of potential acquisitions, pension contributions, debt refinancing, dividend payments and repurchases of our common stock. The commercial paper notes outstanding have original maturities of not more than 90 days from the date of issuance. In preparation for and in anticipation of the Separation Transactions, the Distributions and the Raytheon Merger, the Company entered into and terminated a number of credit agreements. Refer to “Note 10: Borrowings and Lines of Credit” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. On March 16, 2020, we entered into a revolving credit agreement with various banks permitting aggregate borrowings of up to $5.0 billion which became available upon completion of the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020. This credit agreement matures on April 3, 2025. On May 6, 2020, we entered into a revolving credit agreement with various banks permitting aggregate borrowings of up to $2.0 billion. This credit agreement matures on May 5, 2021. As of December 31, 2020, we had revolving credit agreements with various banks permitting aggregate borrowings of up to $7.0 billion, and there were no borrowings outstanding under these agreements. We have an existing universal shelf registration statement, which we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on September 27, 2019, for an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities for future issuance, subject to our internal limitations on the amount of debt to be issued under this shelf registration statement. The Company has offered a voluntary supply chain finance (SCF) program with a global financial institution for more than 10 years, which enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables from the Company to the financial institution at a rate that leverages our credit rating, which might be beneficial to them. Our suppliers’ participation in the SCF program does not impact or change our terms and conditions with those suppliers, and therefore, we have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to participate in the program. In addition, we provide no guarantees or otherwise pay for any of the costs of the program incurred by those suppliers that choose to participate, and have no direct financial relationship with the financial institution, as it relates to the program. As such, amounts due to suppliers that have elected to participate in the SCF program are included in Accounts payable on our Consolidated Balance Sheet and all payment activity related to amounts due to suppliers that elected to participate in the SCF program are reflected in cash flows from operating activities in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flow. As of December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019, the amount due to suppliers participating in the SCF program and included in Accounts payable was approximately $394 million and $460 million, respectively. The decrease from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 is due to decreases in our underlying supply chain purchases. The SCF program does not impact our overall liquidity. We believe our future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs. Further, we continue to have access to the commercial paper markets and our existing credit facilities, and our ability to obtain debt or equity financing, as well as the availability under committed credit lines, provides additional potential sources of liquidity should they be required or appropriate. 52 Table of C ontents Cash Flow—Operating Activities (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Net cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations $ 4,334 $ 5,821 $ 2,670 Net cash flows (used in) provided by operating activities from discontinued operations (728) 3,062 3,652 2020 Compared with 2019 - Continuing Operations Cash generated from operating activities in 2020 was $1,487 million lower than 2019. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in net income after adjustments for depreciation and amortization, the 2020 goodwill impairment charge, the deferred income tax provision, stock compensation costs and net periodic pension and other post retirement (income) expense of $1,950 million primarily driven by a decrease at Pratt & Whitney and Collins Aerospace as a result of the current economic environment primarily driven by COVID-19, partially offset by net income from RIS and RMD following the Raytheon Merger. Included in the decrease in operating cash flows was an increase in pension contributions, as further discussed below, and an unfavorable impact from accounts payable primarily at Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney due to a decline in volume principally driven by the current economic environment primarily driven by COVID-19, which was partially offset by a favorable change in inventory at Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney due to the decline in volume and a favorable change in accounts receivable and contract assets due to the timing of billings and collections in 2020 across our segments. The Company enters into various factoring agreements with third-party financial institutions to sell certain of its receivables. Factoring activity resulted in a decrease of approximately $1.6 billion in cash flows from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the prior year. This decrease in factoring activity was driven by a decrease in factoring levels at Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney primarily driven by lower sales volume. 2019 Compared with 2018 - Continuing Operations Cash generated from operating activities in 2019 was $3.2 billion higher than 2018. The increase is largely driven by an increase in Net income after adjustments for depreciation and amortization, the deferred income tax provision, stock compensation costs, and the net periodic pension and other postretirement (income) expense of $2.3 billion and an increase in other long term assets and liabilities cash flows of $1.1 billion, partially offset by a decrease in working capital cash flows of $0.7 billion. Factoring activity resulted in a decrease of approximately $200 million in cash generated from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the prior year. This decrease in factoring activity was primarily driven by a decrease in factoring levels at Pratt & Whitney, partially offset by an increase at Collins Aerospace. We make both required and discretionary contributions to our pension plans. Required contributions are primarily determined by Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) funding rules, which require us to fully fund our U.S qualified pension plans over a rolling seven-year period as determined annually based on the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA) calculated funded status at the beginning of each year. The funding requirements are primarily based on the year’s expected service cost and amortization of other previously unfunded liabilities, which are dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, the level of market interest rates and actuarial assumptions. We can contribute cash or RTC shares to our plans at our discretion, subject to applicable regulations. As of December 31, 2020, the total investment by the U.S. qualified pension plans in RTC shares was less than 1% of total plan assets. We made the following contributions to our U.S. qualified and international defined benefit and PRB plans’ trusts during the years ended December 31: (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 U.S. qualified defined benefit plans $ 885 $ 25 $ — International defined benefit plans 125 30 79 PRB plans 15 — — Total $ 1,025 $ 55 $ 79 The contributions to our U.S. qualified defined benefit plans for the year ended December 31, 2020 include a $750 million discretionary contribution to the Raytheon Company U.S. qualified pension plans’ trust. As a result of this discretionary contribution, we do not expect to make any required contributions to our U.S. qualified plans’ trust until 2022. The contributions to our International defined benefit plans for the year ended December 31, 2020 include a $51 million discretionary contribution. We expect to make total contributions of approximately $50 million to our international defined benefit plans’ trusts in 2021, which are expected to meet or exceed the current funding requirements. 53 Table of C ontents Global pension and PRB cash funding requirements are expected to be $370 million, $850 million and $750 million in 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively, which includes benefit payments to be paid directly by the company. Operating Activities - Discontinued Operations The $3,790 million decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities from discontinued operations in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily relates to a decrease in net income from discontinued operations driven by the absence of operating activity for the majority of the year, as the Separation Transactions occurred on April 3, 2020. Th e $590 million decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities from discontinued operations in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily relates to a decrease in net income from discontinued operations, partially offset by an increase in working capital cash inflows. Cash Flow—Investing Activities (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Net cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities from continuing operations $ 3,343 $ (2,676) $ (17,259) Net cash flows (used in) provided by investing activities from discontinued operations (241) (416) 286 Our investing activities primarily include capital expenditures, cash investments in customer financing assets, investments/dispositions of businesses, payments related to our collaboration intangible assets and contractual rights to provide product on new aircraft platforms, and settlements of derivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments. 2020 Compared with 2019 - Continuing Operations The $6.0 billion increase in cash flows used in investing activities in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily relates to cash acquired in the Raytheon Merger of $3.2 billion, the sale of our Collins Aerospace military GPS and space-based precision optics businesses for a combined $2.3 billion in gross cash proceeds and a net increase in the source of cash from customer financing assets of $747 million, partially offset by an increase in cash outflows resulting from the Blue Canyon Technologies acquisition of $419 million. Additions to property, plant and equipment were as follows: (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Additions to property, plant and equipment $ (1,795) $ (1,868) $ (1,467) Capital expenditures decreased by $73 million in 2020 compared to 2019 as reductions at Collins Aerospace of $321 million and Pratt & Whitney of $257 million were largely offset by increased capital expenditures driven by the Raytheon Merger. Dispositions of businesses in 2020 of $2,556 million primarily related to the sale of our Collins Aerospace military GPS and space-based precision optics businesses for a combined $2.3 billion in gross cash proceeds. Increases to customer financing assets is primarily driven by additional Geared Turbofan engines to support customer fleets and was a use of cash of $280 million and $787 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decline within increases to customer financing assets is due to fewer engines added in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease in customer financing assets which provided a source of cash of $368 million in 2020 compared to $128 million in 2019 is driven by a sale and leaseback transaction for the sale of equipment in 2020. Refer to “Note 12: Leases” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional discussion of the sale lease-back transaction. In 2020, we increased our collaboration intangible assets by approximately $172 million, which primarily relates to payments made under our 2012 agreement to acquire Rolls-Royce’s collaboration interests in International Aero Engines AG (IAE). At December 31, 2020, we had commercial aerospace financing and other contractual commitments, including exclusivity and collaboration payments of approximately $13.4 billion. Refer to “Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further details on our commercial aerospace financing and other contractual commitments. As discussed in “Note 15: Financial Instruments” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K, we enter into derivative instruments primarily for risk management purposes, including derivatives designated as hedging instruments under the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) and those utilized as economic hedges. We operate internationally and in the normal course of business, are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. These fluctuations can increase the costs of financing, investing and operating the business. We have used derivative instruments, including swaps, forward contracts and options to manage certain foreign currency, interest rate and commodity price exposures. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had net cash receipts of approximately $32 million and $342 million, respectively, from the settlement of these derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments. 54 Table of C ontents In October 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Forcepoint business, which we completed in January 2021, for $1.1 billion in cash. In December 2020, we completed the acquisition of Blue Canyon Technologies, a leading provider of small satellites and spacecraft systems components, for $426 million, net of cash received. Blue Canyon Technologies is reported in the Raytheon Intelligence & Space segment. 2019 Compared with 2018 - Continuing Operations The $14.6 billion decrease in cash flows used in investing activities in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily relates to the absence of cash paid to acquire Rockwell Collins of $14.9 billion in November 2018. Capital expenditures of $1.9 billion for 2019 increased $401 million from 2018. This increase primarily relates to several projects at Collins Aerospace and investments in production and aftermarket capacity at Pratt & Whitney. Dispositions of businesses in 2019 of $134 million primarily consisted of the businesses sold in connection with the Rockwell Acquisition. Increases to customer financing assets is primarily driven by additional Geared Turbofan engines to support customer fleets and was a use of cash of $787 million and $988 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in the source of cash related to customer financing assets of $128 million in 2019 compared to $604 million in 2018 is driven by lower repayments on customer financing. In 2019, we increased our collaboration intangible assets by approximately $351 million, which primarily relates to payments made under our 2012 agreement to acquire Rolls-Royce’s collaboration interests in IAE. Investing Activities - Discontinued Operations The $175 million increase in cash flows used in investing activities from discontinued operations in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily relates to a reduction in capital expenditures at Carrier and Otis of approximately $300 million, partially offset by a reduction in investment cash of approximately $135 million. The $702 million decrease in cash flows provided by investing activities from discontinued operations in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily relates to the absence of $1.0 billion in proceeds from the sale of Taylor Company in June 2018 by Carrier, partially offset by a decrease in business acquisition activity. Cash Flow—Financing Activities (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Net cash flows (used in) provided by financing activities from continuing operations $ (3,860) $ (1,913) $ 12,209 Net cash flows used in financing activities from discontinued operations (1,414) (2,651) (4,244) Our financing activities primarily include the issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, payment of dividends and stock repurchases. 2020 Compared with 2019 - Continuing Operations Financing activities were a cash outflow of $3.9 billion in 2020 compared to a cash outflow of $1.9 billion in 2019. This change is driven by increases in long-term debt repayments of $13.4 billion, a $4.4 billion change in net cash transfers to discontinued operations, an increase in short-term borrowing repayments of $2.9 billion, and an increase in dividends paid on common stock of $0.3 billion, partially offset by an increase in long-term debt issuances of $19.2 billion. The 2020 debt issuances reflect debt incurred by Carrier and Otis of approximately $6 billion and $11 billion, respectively. The net proceeds of these issuances and draws were primarily utilized by UTC to extinguish Raytheon Technologies short-term and long-term debt in order to not exceed the maximum applicable net indebtedness required by the Raytheon Merger Agreement. At December 31, 2020, management had remaining authority to repurchase approximately $5.0 billion of our common stock under the December 7, 2020 share repurchase program. Under this program, shares may be purchased on the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, under accelerated share repurchase programs, and under plans complying with Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We may also reacquire shares outside of the program from time to time in connection with the surrender of shares to cover taxes on vesting of restricted stock and as required under our employee savings plan. We expect to engage in share repurchase activity in 2021. Our ability to repurchase shares is subject to applicable law. 2019 Compared with 2018 - Continuing Operations Financing activities was a cash outflow of $1.9 billion in 2019 compared to a cash inflow of $12.2 billion in 2018. This change is driven by the absence of $13.4 billion of long-term debt issuances in the prior year which was primarily utilized to fund the 55 Table of C ontents Rockwell Acquisition, an increase in dividends paid on common stock of $0.3 billion and an increase in debt repayments of $0.2 billion, partially offset by an increase in short term borrowings of $1.3 billion and a reduction in common stock repurchases of $0.2 billion. Our share repurchases were as follows for the years ended December 31: (dollars in millions; shares in thousands) 2020 2019 2018 $ Shares $ Shares $ Shares Shares of Common Stock repurchased $ 47 330 $ 151 1,133 $ 325 2,727 Our Board of Directors authorized the following cash dividends for the years ended December 31: (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2020 2019 2018 Dividends per share of Common Stock $ 2.160 $ 2.940 $ 2.840 Total dividends paid $ 2,732 $ 2,442 $ 2,170 On February 6, 2021, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.475 per share payable March 25, 2021 to shareowners of record at the close of business on February 26, 2021. We had the following issuances of long-term debt during 2020 and 2018, which is inclusive of issuances made by Carrier and Otis which were primarily used by the Company to extinguish certain Raytheon Technologies short-term and long-term debt and, therefore, were treated as a distribution from discontinued operations within financing activities from continuing operation on our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows: Issuance Date Description of Notes Aggregate Principal Balance (in millions) May 18, 2020 2.250% notes due 2030 $ 1,000 3.125% notes due 2050 $ 1,000 March 27, 2020 Term Loan due 2023 (Otis) (1) $ 1,000 Term Loan due 2023 (Carrier) (1) $ 1,750 February 27, 2020 1.923% notes due 2023 (1) $ 500 LIBOR plus 0.450% floating rate notes due 2023 (1) $ 500 2.056% notes due 2025 (1) $ 1,300 2.242% notes due 2025 (1) $ 2,000 2.293% notes due 2027 (1) $ 500 2.493% notes due 2027 (1) $ 1,250 2.565% notes due 2030 (1) $ 1,500 2.722% notes due 2030 (1) $ 2,000 3.112% notes due 2040 (1) $ 750 3.377% notes due 2040 (1) $ 1,500 3.362% notes due 2050 (1) $ 750 3.577% notes due 2050 (1) $ 2,000 August 16, 2018 3.350% notes due 2021 (2) $ 1,000 3.650% notes due 2023 (2) $ 2,250 3.950% notes due 2025 (2) $ 1,500 4.125% notes due 2028 (2) $ 3,000 4.450% notes due 2038 (2) $ 750 4.625% notes due 2048 (3) $ 1,750 LIBOR plus 0.65% floating rate notes due 2021 (2) $ 750 May 18, 2018 1.150% notes due 2024 (4) € 750 2.150% notes due 2030 (4) $ 500 EURIBOR plus 0.20% floating rate notes due 2020 (4) $ 750 (1) The debt issuances and term loan draws reflect debt incurred by Carrier and Otis.

Financing Activities - Discontinued Operations The $1.2 billion decrease in cash flows used in financing activities from discontinued operations in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily relates to $703 million of debt extinguishment costs related to the early repayment of debt in 2020 and cash distributions made to Carrier and Otis of $2.8 billion, which were more than offset by a change in net transfer activity of $4.5 billion. The $1.6 billion decrease in cash flows used in financing activities from discontinued operations in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily relates to the change in net transfers to continuing operations. 57 Table of C ontents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the Consolidated Financial Statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. The most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below. Actual results in these areas could differ from management’s estimates. Long-Term Contract Accounting. We recognize revenue on an over-time basis for substantially all defense contracts and certain long-term aerospace aftermarket contracts. We measure progress toward completion of these contracts on a percentage of completion basis, using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion. Incurred costs represent work performed, which correspond with and best depict transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs are incurred over a period of time, which can be several years, and the estimation of these costs requires management’s judgment. We review our Estimate at Completion (EACs) on significant contracts on a periodic basis and for others, no less than annually or when a change in circumstances warrant a modification to a previous estimate. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of the Company’s performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment by management on a contract by contract basis. As part of this process, management reviews information including, but not limited to, any outstanding key contract matters, progress towards completion and the related program schedule, identified risks and opportunities and the related changes in estimates of revenues and costs. The risks and opportunities relate to management’s judgment about the ability and cost to achieve the schedule, consideration of customer-directed delays or reductions in scheduled deliveries, technical requirements, customer activity levels, such as flight hours or aircraft landings, and related variable consideration. Management’s judgment related to these considerations has become increasingly more significant given the current economic environment primarily caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Management must make assumptions and estimates regarding contract revenue and costs, including estimates of labor productivity and availability, the complexity and scope of the work to be performed, the availability and cost of materials, the length of time to complete the performance obligation, execution by our subcontractors, the availability and timing of funding from our customer, overhead cost rates, and current and past maintenance cost and frequency driven by estimated aircraft and engine utilization and estimated useful lives of components, among others. In particular, fixed-price development programs involve significant management judgment, as development contracts by nature have elements that have not been done before and thus, are highly subject to future unexpected cost growth. Cost estimates may also include the estimated cost of satisfying our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes in the form of either offset obligations or in-country industrial participation (ICIP) agreements, required under certain contracts primarily within our RIS and RMD segments. These obligations may or may not be distinct depending on their nature. If cash is paid to a customer to satisfy our offset obligations it is recorded as a reduction in the transaction price. Changes in estimates of net sales, cost of sales and the related impact to operating profit are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis, which recognizes the cumulative effect of the profit changes on current and prior periods based on a performance obligation’s percentage of completion in the current period. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of our performance obligations. Our EAC adjustments also include the establishment of loss provisions on our contracts accounted for on a percentage of completion basis. Net EAC adjustments had the following impact on our operating results: (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2020 2019 2018 Operating profit (loss) $ (643) $ (69) $ (50) Income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners (1) (508) (55) (40) Diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners (1) $ (0.37) $ (0.06) $ (0.05) (1) Amounts reflect a U.S. statutory tax rate of 21%, which approximates our tax rate on our EAC adjustments. As a result of the Raytheon Merger, Raytheon Company’s contracts accounted for on a percentage of completion basis were reset to zero percent complete as of the merger date, since only the unperformed portion of the contract at the merger date represents the obligation of the Company. For additional information related to the Raytheon Merger, see “Note 2: Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Costs incurred for engineering and development of aerospace products under contracts with customers are capitalized as contract fulfillment costs, to the extent recoverable from the associated contract margin and customer funding, and subsequently amortized as the OEM products are delivered to the customer. The estimation of contract margin requires management’s judgment. We regularly assess capitalized contract fulfillment costs for impairment. 58 Table of C ontents Income Taxes. Management believes that our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits, which may be realized over an extended period of time. For those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax carryforwards or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not likely, a valuation allowance is provided. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we estimate future taxable income, considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards. Valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be affected by changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future, we would reduce such amounts through an increase to tax expense in the period in which that determination is made or when tax law changes are enacted. Conversely, if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts, we would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a decrease to tax expense in the period in which that determination is made. In the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax positions. We assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. In addition, we have entered into certain internal legal entity restructuring transactions necessary to effectuate the Separation Transactions. We have accrued tax on these transactions based on our interpretation of the applicable tax laws and our determination of appropriate entity valuations. See “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” and “Note 13: Income Taxes” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion. Management has determined that the distributions of Carrier and Otis on April 3, 2020, and certain related internal business separation transactions, qualified as tax-free under applicable law. In making these determinations, we applied the tax law in the relevant jurisdictions to our facts and circumstances and obtained tax rulings from the relevant taxing authorities, tax opinions, and/or other external tax advice related to the concluded tax treatment. If the completed distributions of Carrier or Otis, in each case, or certain internal business separation transactions, were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment, the Company could be subject to significant liabilities, and there could be material adverse impacts on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods. Goodwill and Intangible Assets. The assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Intangible assets acquired in business combinations consist of patents, trademarks/tradenames, developed technology, customer relationships, and other intangible assets. The fair value for acquired customer relationship intangibles is determined as of the acquisition date based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the future after-tax cash flows arising from the follow-on revenue from customer relationships that existed on the acquisition date over their estimated lives, including the probability of expected future contract renewals and revenue, less a contributory assets charge, all of which is discounted to present value. The fair value of the trademark and tradename intangible assets are determined utilizing the relief from royalty method which is a form of the income approach. Under this method, a royalty rate based on observed market royalties is applied to projected revenue supporting the tradename and discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. See “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further details. We applied these approaches to the valuation of intangibles for the Raytheon Merger, for which the most significant intangible assets identified were customer relationships and tradenames. Specific to these intangible assets, our estimates of market participant future cash flows included forecasted revenue growth rates, remaining developmental effort, operational performance including company specific synergies, program life cycles, material and labor pricing, and other relevant customer, contractual and market factors. For the customer relationships, where appropriate, the net cash flows were probability-adjusted to reflect the uncertainties associated with the underlying assumptions, including cancellation rates related to backlog, government demand for sole-source and recompete contracts and win rates for recompete contracts, as well as the risk profile of the net cash flows utilized in the valuation. In addition, the net cash flows were discounted using an appropriate discount rate that requires judgment by management. The estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in connection with the Raytheon Merger was approximately $19.1 billion. Also included within intangible assets are exclusivity assets, which are payments made to secure certain contractual rights to provide products on new commercial aerospace platforms. Such payments are capitalized when there are distinct rights obtained and there are sufficient incremental cash flows to support the recoverability of the assets established. Otherwise, the applicable 59 Table of C ontents portion of the payments are expensed. The gross value of these contractual commitments at December 31, 2020 was approximately $11.6 billion, of which approximately $3.3 billion has been paid to date. We regularly assess the recoverability of these intangibles, which is dependent upon our assumptions around the future success and profitability of the underlying aircraft platforms including the associated aftermarket revenue streams, and the related future cash flows. Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to impairment testing annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired. The impairment test compares carrying values of the reporting units to its estimated fair values. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value then the carrying value is reduced to fair value. In developing our estimates for the fair value of our reporting units, significant judgment is required in the determination of the appropriateness of using a qualitative assessment or quantitative assessment. For the quantitative assessments that are performed, fair value is primarily based on income approaches using a discounted cash flow method and relief from royalty method, which have significant assumptions including sales growth rates, projected operating profit, terminal growth rates, discount rates and royalty rates. Such assumptions are subject to variability from year to year and are directly impacted by, among other things, global market conditions. We considered the deterioration in general economic and market conditions primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic to be a triggering event in the first and second quarters of 2020, requiring an impairment evaluation of goodwill, intangible assets and other assets in our commercial aerospace businesses, Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney. Beginning in the second quarter of 2020, we observed several airline customer bankruptcies, delays and cancellations of aircraft purchases by airlines, fleet retirements and repositioning of OEM production schedules and we experienced a significant decline in revenues at our Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney businesses due to a decline in flight hours, aircraft fleet utilization, shop visits and commercial OEM deliveries. These factors contributed to a deterioration of our expectations regarding the timing of a return to pre-COVID-19 commercial flight activity, which further reduced our future sales and cash flows expectations. In the second quarter of 2020, we evaluated the Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney reporting units for goodwill impairment and determined that the carrying values of two of the six Collins Aerospace reporting units exceeded the sum of discounted future cash flows, resulting in goodwill impairments of $3.2 billion. Collins Aerospace discounted future cash flow estimates were developed for three scenarios: a base case, a downside case, and an upside case. These scenarios included assumptions regarding future airline flight activity, out of warranty hours on original equipment, expected repairs, upgrades and replacements, future OEM manufacturing schedules and related environmental assumptions, including individuals’ desire to return to normal travel, business needs to travel, and potential cures or vaccines to prevent or reduce the effects of COVID-19. These estimates require a significant amount of judgment and are subject to change based upon factors outside our control. We weighted the three scenarios as follows: 50% for the base case, 40% for the downside case, and 10% for the upside case, and used these weightings, as we believed they reflected the risks and opportunities relative to our estimates. Goodwill impairment was not indicated for any of the other reporting units evaluated for impairment in any of these scenarios. We did not identify any further deterioration to our expectations in the third quarter of 2020, and therefore, did not have a triggering event. On October 1, 2020, we changed our annual goodwill impairment testing date from July 1 to October 1 to better align with the timing of our annual long-term planning process. This change was not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements as it did not delay, accelerate, or avoid any potential goodwill impairment charges. We completed our annual impairment testing as of October 1, 2020, where we assessed our Pratt & Whitney, RIS, RMD and one of the Collins Aerospace reporting units using qualitative factors to determine whether it was more likely than not that any individual reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value (step 0) and determined that no further testing was required based on there being no significant changes at RIS and RMD since the acquisition of Raytheon Company and the substantial cushion of fair value over book value at the other reporting units. For the remainder of our Collins Aerospace reporting units, we compared the fair value of the reporting units to their respective carrying values (step 1), and determined that no additional adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill were necessary. Based on our annual impairment analysis as of October 1, 2020, the reporting unit that was closest to impairment was a reporting unit at Collins Aerospace with a fair value in excess of book value, including goodwill, of $1.2 billion or 7%. All other factors equal, if the discount rate used for the annual impairment analysis increased by 25 basis points, the fair value in excess of book value for the Collins Aerospace reporting unit would have been approximately $0.3 billion or 2%. Alternatively, all other factors equal, if the cash flows were decreased by 10%, the fair value for the Collins Aerospace reporting unit would have decreased by approximately $1.8 billion. Material changes in these estimates could occur and result in additional impairments in future periods. The Company continuously monitors for events and circumstances that could negatively impact the key assumptions in determining the fair value of goodwill, including long-term revenue growth projections, profitability, discount rates, recent market valuations from transactions by comparable companies, volatility in the Company’s market capitalization, and general 60 Table of C ontents industry, market and macro-economic conditions. It is possible that future changes in such circumstances, including a more prolonged and/or severe COVID-19 pandemic than originally anticipated, or future changes in the variables associated with the judgments, assumptions and estimates used in assessing the fair value of our reporting units, including the expected long term recovery of airline travel to pre-COVID-19 levels, would require the Company to record a non-cash impairment charge. Contingent Liabilities. Our operating units include businesses which sell products and services and conduct operations throughout the world. As described in “Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K, contractual, regulatory and other matters in the normal course of business may arise that subject us to claims or litigation. Of note, the design, development, production and support of new aerospace technologies is inherently complex and subject to risk. Since the PW1000G Geared Turbofan engine entered into service in 2016, technical issues have been identified and experienced with the engine, which is typical for new engines and new aerospace technologies. Pratt & Whitney has addressed these issues through various improvements and modifications. These issues have resulted in financial impacts, including increased warranty provisions, customer contract settlements, and reductions in contract performance estimates. Additional technical issues, either related to this program or other programs, may also arise in the normal course, which may result in financial impacts that could be material to the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, we have significant contracts with the U.S. government, subject to government oversight and audit, which may require significant adjustment of contract prices. We accrue for liabilities associated with these matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of then currently available facts with respect to each matter. When no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, the minimum is accrued. The inherent uncertainty related to the outcome of these matters can result in amounts materially different from any provisions made with respect to their resolution. Employee Benefit Plans . We sponsor domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and PRB plans. Assumptions used to calculate our funded status are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators. They are evaluated annually at December 31 and when significant events require a mid-year remeasurement. A change in any of these assumptions or actual experience that differs from these assumptions are subject to recognition in pension and postretirement net periodic benefit (income) expense reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans require judgement. Major assumptions include the discount rate and EROA. Other assumptions include mortality rates, demographic assumptions (such as retirement age), rate of increase in employee compensation levels, and health care cost increase projections. The weighted-average discount rates used to measure pension and PRB liabilities are based on yield curves developed using high-quality corporate bonds as well as plan specific cash flows. For our significant plans, we utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit expense by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant discounted projected cash flows. The following table shows the sensitivity of our pension and PRB plan liabilities and net periodic benefit income to a 25 basis point change in the discount rates for benefit obligations, interest cost and service cost as of December 31, 2020: (dollars in millions) Increase in Discount Rate of 25 bps Decrease in Discount Rate of 25 bps Projected benefit obligation $ (2,072) $ 2,183 Net periodic benefit income (7) 8 The discount rate sensitivities assume no change in the shape of the yield curve that will be applied to the projected cash outflows for future benefit payments in order to calculate interest and service cost. A flattening of the yield curve, results in a narrowing of the spread between interest and obligation discount rates and would decrease our net periodic benefit income. Conversely, a steepening of the yield curve would result in an increase in the spread between interest and obligation discount rates and would increase our net periodic benefit income. The EROA is the average rate of earnings expected over the long term on assets invested to fund anticipated future benefit payment obligations. In determining the EROA assumption, we consider the target asset allocation of plan assets, as well as economic and other indicators of future performance. We may consult with and consider the opinions of financial and other professionals in determining the appropriate capital market assumptions. Return projections are validated using a simulation model that incorporates yield curves, credit spreads and risk premiums to project long-term prospective returns. Differences between actual asset returns in a given year and the EROA do not necessarily indicate a change in the assumption is required, as the EROA represents the expected average returns over a long-term horizon. Net periodic benefit income is also sensitive to changes in the EROA. An increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the EROA would have increased or decreased our 2020 net periodic benefit income by approximately $116 million. 61 Table of C ontents We must apply both Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) requirements under U.S. GAAP (as described above) and U.S. government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) requirements to calculate pension and PRB expense. Both FAS and CAS expense use long term assumptions requiring judgement, but the CAS expense calculation is different from the FAS requirements and calculation methodology. While the ultimate liability for pension costs under FAS and CAS is similar, the pattern of cost recognition is different. Our CAS pension expense is comprised primarily of CAS service cost as well as amortization amounts resulting from demographic or economic experience different than expected, changes in assumptions, or changes in plan provisions. CAS requires contractors to compare the liability using a discount rate based on the EROA to a liability using a discount rate based on high-quality corporate bonds, and use the greater of the two liability calculations in developing CAS expense. Additionally, unlike FAS, CAS expense is only recognized for plans that are not fully funded. Consequently, if plans become or cease to be fully funded under CAS due to our asset or liability experience, our CAS expense will change accordingly. ACCOUNTING STANDARDS For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see the Accounting Pronouncements section in “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS We extend a variety of financial guarantees to third parties in support of unconsolidated affiliates and for potential financing requirements of commercial aerospace customers. We also have obligations arising from sales of certain businesses and assets, including indemnities for representations and warranties and environmental, health and safety, tax and employment matters. Circumstances that could cause the contingent obligations and liabilities arising from these arrangements to come to fruition include changes in an underlying transaction (e.g., hazardous waste discoveries, etc.), nonperformance under a contract, customer requests for financing, or deterioration in the financial condition of the guaranteed party. A summary of our consolidated contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2020 is as follows: Payments Due by Period (dollars in millions) Total 2021 2022-2023 2024-2025 Thereafter Long-term debt—principal $ 31,470 $ 550 $ 2,805 $ 2,844 $ 25,271 Long-term debt—future interest 19,915 1,328 2,532 2,390 13,665 Operating leases 2,470 632 803 389 646 Purchase obligations 22,111 14,407 6,669 874 161 Other long-term liabilities 3,642 587 2,001 261 793 Total contractual obligations $ 79,608 $ 17,504 $ 14,810 $ 6,758 $ 40,536 Purchase obligations include amounts committed for the purchase of goods and services under legally enforceable contracts or purchase orders. Where it is not practically feasible to determine the legally enforceable portion of our obligation under certain of our long-term purchase agreements, we include additional expected purchase obligations beyond what is legally enforceable. Approximately 60% of our purchase obligations disclosed above represent purchase orders for products to be delivered under firm contracts with the U.S. government for which we have full recourse under customary contract termination clauses. Other long-term liabilities primarily include those amounts on our December 31, 2020 balance sheet representing performance and operating cost guarantees, estimated environmental remediation costs and expected cash funding requirements under employee benefit programs. Amounts beyond 2023 for cash funding requirements under employee benefits plans are not included. The timing of expected cash flows associated with these obligations is based upon management’s estimates over the terms of these agreements and is largely based upon historical experience. The above table also does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $1,225 million, the timing of which is uncertain, except for $36 million that may become payable during 2021. Refer to “Note 13: Income Taxes” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional discussion on unrecognized tax benefits. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Refer to “Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for discussion on contractual commitments and contingencies. 62 Table of C ontents ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Our operations are subject to environmental regulation by federal, state and local authorities in the United States and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our foreign operations. As a result, we have established, and continually update, policies relating to environmental standards of performance for our operations worldwide. We believe that expenditures necessary to comply with the present regulations governing environmental protection will not have a material effect upon our competitive posit ion, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. We have been identified as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), more commonly known as a Superfund, for a number of sites. The nature and extent of environmental concerns vary from site to site and our share of responsibility varies from sole responsibility to very little responsibility. In estimating our liability for remediation, we consider our likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation expense and the ability of other potentially responsible parties to fulfill their obligations. We also lease certain government-owned properties and generally are not liable for remediation of preexisting environmental contamination at these sites. As a result, we generally do not provide for these costs in our Consolidated Financing Statements. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $835 million and $725 million reserved for environmental remediation, respectively. Cash outflows for environmental remediation were $53 million in 2020, $44 million in 2019, and $41 million in 2018. We estimate that ongoing environmental remediation expenditures in each of the next two years will not exceed approximately $100 million. GOVERNMENT MATTERS As described above in “Critical Accounting Estimates—Contingent Liabilities,” our contracts with the U.S. government are subject to audits. Such audits may recommend that certain contract prices should be reduced to comply with various government regulations, or that certain payments be delayed or withheld. We are also the subject of one or more investigations and legal proceedings initiated by the U.S. government with respect to government contract matters. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings, within Part I, and “Note 13: Income Taxes” and “Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of these and other government matters. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our primary market exposures are to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as it relates to our market risk sensitive instruments, which are primarily cash, debt and derivative instruments. To quantify our market risk exposure, we perform a sensitivity analysis based on hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We changed our methodology for quantifying our market risk exposure in the second quarter of 2020 to better align with how we manage our risk exposure. Refer to “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles,” “Note 10: Borrowings and Lines of Credit” and “Note 15: Financial Instruments” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional discussion of foreign currency exchange, interest rates and financial instruments. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk. We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies and to various internal or external financing arrangements. We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business and financing. We actively manage foreign currency exposures that are associated with commi tted foreign currency purchases and sales, and other assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business at the operating unit level. More than insignificant exposures that cannot be naturally offset within an operating unit are hedged with foreign currency derivatives. Foreign exchange exposures arising from intercompany loan and deposit transactions are also hedged regularly. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency hedges was $11.6 billion and $13.0 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively . Foreign currency forward contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. A 10% unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have resulted in an increase in unrealized losses of $0.8 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Such losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. We believe these foreign currency forward exchange contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments, when taken together, do not create material market risk Within our aerospace business, our sales are typically denominated in U.S. Dollars. However, for our non-U.S. based entities, such as Pratt & Whitney Canada (P&WC), a substantial portion of their costs are incurred in local currencies. Consequently, there is a foreign currency exchange impact and risk to operational results as U.S. Dollars must be converted to local currencies such as the Canadian Dollar in order to meet local currency cost obligations. Additionally, we transact business in various foreign currencies which exposes our cash flows and earnings to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to minimize the exposure that exists from changes in the exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar against these other currencies, we hedge 63 Table of C ontents a certain portion of sales to secure the rates at which U.S. Dollars will be converted. The majority of this hedging activity occurs at P&WC and Collins Aerospace, and hedging activity also occurs to a lesser extent at the remainder of Pratt & Whitney. At P&WC and Collins Aerospace, firm and forecasted sales for both original equipment and spare parts are hedged at varying amounts for up to 49 months on the U.S. Dollar sales exposure as represented by the excess of U.S. Dollar sales over U.S. Dollar denominated purchases. Hedging gains and losses resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are partially offset by the foreign currency translation impacts that are generated on the translation of local currency operating results into U.S. Dollars for reporting purposes. While the objective of the hedging program is to minimize the foreign currency exchange impact on operating results, there are typically variances between the hedging gains or losses and the translational impact due to the length of hedging contracts, changes in the sales profile, volatility in the exchange rates and other such operational considerations. Interest Rate Risk. We have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally fixed-rate debt obligations. A 100 basis points unfavorable interest rate movement would have had an approximate $4 billion impact on the fair value of our fixed-rate debt at both December 31, 2020 and 2019. The investors in our fixed-rate debt obligations do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed-rate debt. From time to time, we may hedge to floating rates using interest rate swaps. Currently, we do not hold any derivative contracts that hedge our interest exposures, but may consider such strategies in the future. 64 Table of C ontents ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The management of RTC is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Management has assessed the effectiveness of RTC’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in its Internal Control—Integrated Framework , released in 2013 . Management concluded that based on its assessment, RTC’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020. The effectiveness of RTC’s internal control over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2020, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein. /s/ GREGORY J. HAYES Gregory J. Hayes President and Chief Executive Officer /s/ ANTHONY F. O’BRIEN Anthony F. O’Brien Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer /s/ MICHAEL J. WOOD Michael J. Wood Corporate Vice President and Controller 65 Table of C ontents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareowners and Board of Directors of Raytheon Technologies Corporation Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Raytheon Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income (loss), of changes in equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2019. Basis for Opinions The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the 66 Table of C ontents company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Valuation of Acquired Customer Relationship and Tradename Intangible Assets As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed its merger with Raytheon Company (“Raytheon”) on April 3, 2020 for net consideration of $33.2 billion. The merger was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, and the Company was treated as the accounting acquirer. As a result of this merger, $12.9 billion of customer relationship intangible assets and $5.4 billion of tradename intangible assets were recorded. Fair value of the customer relationship intangible assets were estimated using a discounted cash flow valuation method and fair value of the tradename intangible assets were estimated using a relief from royalty valuation method. Management applied significant judgment in determining the fair value of the intangible assets, which involved the use of significant assumptions for forecasted revenue growth rates and the discount rate. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of acquired customer relationship and tradename intangible assets arising from the merger with Raytheon is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when determining the fair value of the these intangible assets, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to management’s assumptions for the forecasted revenue growth rates and the discount rate. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls over management’s determination of forecasted revenue growth rates and the discount rate assumptions used in the valuation of the customer relationship and tradename intangible assets. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for determining the fair value of the customer relationship and tradename intangible assets. Testing management’s process included evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methods, testing the completeness, accuracy and relevance of the underlying data used in the valuations and evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions related to the forecasted revenue growth rates and the discount rate. Evaluating the reasonableness of the forecasted revenue growth rates involved considering the past performance of Raytheon, as well as economic and industry data. The discount rate was evaluated by considering the cost of capital of comparable businesses and other industry factors. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the Company’s discount rate assumption. Tax-free Determinations of Certain Internal Separation Transactions and the Distributions of Carrier Global Corporation and Otis Worldwide Corporation. As described in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, management has determined that the distributions of Carrier Global Corporation (“Carrier”) and Otis Worldwide Corporation (“Otis”) on April 3, 2020, and certain related internal business separation transactions (the distributions and internal separation transactions referred to together as the “Transactions”), qualified as tax-free under applicable law. In making these determinations, management applied the tax law in the relevant jurisdictions to their facts and circumstances and obtained tax rulings from the relevant taxing authorities, tax opinions, and/or other external tax advice related to the concluded tax treatment. If the completed distributions of Carrier or Otis, in each case, or certain internal business separation transactions, were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment, the Company could be subject to significant liabilities, and there could be material adverse impacts on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods. 67 Table of C ontents The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the tax-free determinations of certain internal separation transactions and the distributions of Carrier and Otis is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in applying relevant tax laws and regulations and assumptions in determining that certain internal separation transactions and the distributions of Carrier and Otis qualify for tax-free status, and (ii) the significant impact to the financial statements if these tax-free determinations were determined to be inappropriate by the relevant taxing authorities. This in turn led to a significant degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating audit evidence relating to the tax-free determination of certain internal separation transactions and the distributions of Carrier and Otis. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the significant judgments, including inputs and assumptions, relating to the determination of the tax-free nature of the transactions. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating the information, including tax rulings from relevant taxing authorities, external opinions and other tax advice, tax law, and other relevant evidence used by management to support management’s position that the Transactions qualified for tax-free status. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the Transactions, related assumptions, and certain representations from management, as well as the application of relevant tax laws. Revenue Recognition - Contract Estimates at Completion As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, a significant portion of the Company’s revenues of $56.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 are from long-term contracts associated with the design, development, manufacture or modification of complex aerospace or defense equipment or related services. The timing of the satisfaction of performance obligations varies across the Company’s businesses due to their diverse product and service mix, customer base, and contractual terms. Substantially all of the Company’s revenues from the Raytheon Intelligence & Space and Raytheon Missiles & Defense segments are recognized over time because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer. The Company’s revenues from certain long-term aftermarket contracts within its Pratt & Whitney segment are recognized over the contract period as a series of daily performance obligations to stand ready to provide spare parts, product maintenance and aftermarket services. For the performance obligations satisfied over time, revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of the Company’s performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment by management on a contract by contract basis. Within the Raytheon Intelligence & Space and Raytheon Missiles & Defense segments, the variables and significant judgments relate to key contract matters, progress towards completion and the related program schedule, identified risks and opportunities and the related changes in estimates of revenues and costs. The risks and opportunities for the contracts relate to management’s ability and cost to achieve the schedule, consideration of customer-directed delays or reductions in scheduled deliveries, technical requirements, customer activity levels and related variable consideration. Management also makes judgments about variables related to estimates of labor productivity and availability, the complexity and scope of the work to be performed, the availability and cost of materials, the length of time to complete the performance obligation, execution by the Company’s subcontractors, the availability and timing of funding from the customer, overhead cost rates, and the estimated cost of satisfying the Company’s industrial cooperation agreements required under certain contracts. Within the Pratt & Whitney segment these variables and significant judgments relate to current and past maintenance cost and frequency experience. Management reviews contract estimates at completion on a periodic basis and no less than annually or when a change in circumstances warrant a modification to a previous estimate. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition - contract estimates at completion is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in developing their estimates of total revenue and total costs at completion, including significant judgments and assumptions on a contract by contract basis. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating audit evidence relating to management’s estimates of total revenue and total cost at completion for contracts. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls over the estimates of total revenue and total costs at completion. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the estimated total revenue and total costs at completion. Testing management’s process included evaluating on a test basis the reasonableness of certain significant 68 Table of C ontents judgments and variables considered by management specific to each contract or performance obligation. Evaluating the significant judgments and assumptions related to the estimates of total revenue and total costs at completion involved evaluating whether the significant judgments and assumptions used were reasonable considering: (i) management’s historical forecasting accuracy, (ii) evidence to support the relevant aforementioned variables, (iii) the consistent application of accounting policies, and (iv) the timely identification of circumstances which may warrant a modification to a previous estimate. Certain Goodwill and Unamortized Intangible Assets Impairment Assessments As described in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated goodwill and intangible asset balances were $54.3 billion and $40.5 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2020. Intangible assets included unamortized intangible assets of $8.7 billion as of December 31, 2020. Goodwill and unamortized intangible assets are subject to impairment testing annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired. In the second quarter of 2020, management observed several airline customer bankruptcies, delays and cancellations of aircraft purchases by airlines, fleet retirements and repositioning of production schedules. These factors contributed to a deterioration of management’s expectations regarding the timing of a return to pre-COVID-19 commercial flight activity, which reduced future sales and cash flows expectations. Management considered these factors to be a triggering event requiring impairment evaluation of goodwill, intangible assets and other assets in its commercial aerospace businesses. The carrying value of two Collins Aerospace reporting units exceeded the sum of discounted cash flows resulting in goodwill impairments of $3.2 billion. In developing the estimates for the fair value of reporting units and unamortized intangible assets, significant judgment is required by management in the determination of the appropriateness of using a qualitative assessment or quantitative assessment. For the quantitative assessments that are performed for goodwill and unamortized intangible assets, fair value is primarily based on income approaches using a discounted cash flow method and relief from royalty method, respectively, which have significant assumptions related to sales growth rates, projected operating profit, terminal growth rates, discount rates and royalty rates. The impairment testing compares carrying values to estimated fair values. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, then the carrying value is reduced to fair value. The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to certain goodwill and unamortized intangible assets quantitative impairment assessments is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value measurements of these assets. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures to evaluate management’s fair value measurements and the applicable significant assumptions for both goodwill and unamortized intangible assets relating to sales growth rates, projected operating profit, terminal growth rates, and discount rates. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s goodwill and unamortized intangible assets quantitative impairment assessments, including controls over the valuation of the Company’s reporting units and unamortized intangible assets. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimates, which included evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow and relief from royalty methods; testing the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data in the estimates; and evaluating the significant assumptions used by management relating to sales growth rates, projected operating profit, terminal growth rates and discount rates. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to sales growth rates, projected operating profit, and terminal growth rates involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the reporting units and unamortized intangible assets, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the Company’s discounted cash flow and relief from royalty methods, and terminal growth rate and discount rate assumptions. /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Boston, Massachusetts February 8, 2021 We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1947. 69 Table of C ontents RAYTHEON TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS (dollars in millions, except per share amounts;

Actual results could differ from those estimates. Separation Transactions and Distributions. On April 3, 2020, United Technologies Corporation (UTC) (since renamed Raytheon Technologies Corporation) completed the previously announced separation of its business into three independent, publicly traded companies – UTC, Carrier Global Corporation (Carrier) and Otis Worldwide Corporation (Otis) (such separations, the Separation Transactions). UTC distributed all of the outstanding shares of Carrier common stock and all of the outstanding shares of Otis common stock to UTC shareowners who held shares of UTC common stock as of the close of business on March 19, 2020, the record date for the distributions (the Distributions). UTC distributed 866,158,910 and 433,079,455 shares of common stock of Carrier and Otis, respectively in the Distributions, each of which was effective at 12:01 a.m., Eastern Time, on April 3, 2020. The historical results of Carrier and Otis are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Unless otherwise indicated, amounts and activity throughout these Consolidated Financial Statements are presented on a continuing operations basis, and includes the reclassification of certain long term assets and liabilities to current using the duration of the related contract or program as our operating cycle. Refer to “Note 3: Discontinued Operations” and “Consolidation and Classification” below for further details. Raytheon Merger. On April 3, 2020, following the completion of the Separation Transactions and the Distributions, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated June 9, 2019, as amended, UTC and Raytheon Company (Raytheon) completed their previously announced all-stock merger of equals transaction (the Raytheon Merger). Upon closing of the Raytheon Merger, Raytheon Company became a wholly owned subsidiary of UTC, which changed its name to “Raytheon Technologies Corporation.” Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “we,” “our,” “us,” “the Company,” “Raytheon Technologies,” and “RTC” mean United Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries when referring to periods prior to the Raytheon Merger and to the combined company, Raytheon Technologies Corporation, when referring to periods after the Raytheon Merger. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “Raytheon Company,” or “Raytheon” mean Raytheon Company and its subsidiaries prior to the Raytheon Merger. UTC was determined to be the accounting acquirer in the merger and, as a result, the financial statements of Raytheon Technologies as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 include Raytheon Company’s financial position and results of operations for the period subsequent to the completion of the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020. COVID-19 Pandemic. In March 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and a national emergency by the U.S. government. The pandemic has negatively affected the U.S. and global economy, disrupted global supply chains and financial markets, and resulted in significant travel restrictions, mandated facility closures and shelter-in-place and social distancing orders in numerous jurisdictions around the world. Raytheon Technologies is taking all prudent measures to protect the health and safety of our employees, such as practicing social distancing, performing deep cleaning in all of our facilities, temperature screening, health questionnaires and enabling our employees to work from home where possible. We have also taken appropriate actions to help support our communities in addressing the challenges posed by the pandemic, including the production and donation of personal protective equipment. Our business and operations and the industries in which we operate have been significantly impacted by public and private sector policies and initiatives in the U.S. and worldwide to address the transmission of COVID-19, such as the imposition of travel restrictions and the adoption of remote working. Additionally, public sentiments regarding air travel have also had a significant impact. We began to experience issues related to COVID-19 in the first quarter of 2020, primarily related to a limited number of facility closures, less than full staffing, and disruptions in supplier deliveries, most significantly in our Collins Aerospace Systems (Collins Aerospace) and Pratt & Whitney businesses. The continued disruption to air travel and commercial activities and the significant restrictions and limitations on businesses, particularly within the aerospace and commercial airline industries, have negatively impacted global supply, demand and distribution capabilities. These conditions, which began in the second quarter of 2020, continued through the remainder of 2020. In particular, the unprecedented decrease in air travel resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting our airline and airframer customers, and their demand for the products and services of our Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney businesses. Based on recent public data, revenue passenger miles (RPMs) declined by approximately 65% in the first eleven months of 2020, compared to the prior year, due to the pandemic. As a result, our airline customers have reported significant reductions in fleet utilization, aircraft grounding and unplanned retirements, and have deferred and, in some cases, cancelled new aircraft deliveries. Airlines have shifted to cash conservation behaviors such as deferring engine maintenance due to lower flight hours and aircraft utilization, requesting extended payment terms, deferring delivery of new aircraft and spare engines and 75 Table of C ontents requesting discounts on engine maintenance. Some airline customers have filed for bankruptcy due to their inability to meet their financial obligations. Additionally, we are seeing purchase order declines in line with publicly communicated aircraft production volumes as original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers delay and cancel orders. We continue to monitor these trends and are working closely with our customers. We have been and continue to actively mitigate costs and adjust production schedules to accommodate these declines in demand. We have also been taking actions to preserve capital and protect the long-term needs of our businesses, including cutting discretionary spending, significantly reducing capital expenditures and research and development spend, suspending our share buybacks in 2020, deferring merit increases and implementing temporary pay reductions, freezing non-essential hiring, repositioning employees to defense work, furloughing employees when needed, and personnel reductions. In 2020, we recorded total restructuring charges of $ 777 million primarily related to personnel reductions at our Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney businesses to preserve capital and at our corporate headquarters due to consolidation from the Raytheon Merger. The former Raytheon Company businesses, although experiencing minor impacts, have not experienced significant facility closures or other significant business disruptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the impacts described above that have resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect our future operating results, particularly those of our Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney businesses to continue to be significantly negatively impacted. Our expectations regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and its potential financial impact are based on available information and assumptions that we believe are reasonable at this time; however, the actual financial impact is highly uncertain and subject to a wide range of factors and future developments. While we believe that the long-term outlook for the aerospace industry remains positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel demand, there is significant uncertainty with respect to when commercial air traffic levels will begin to recover, and whether and at what point capacity will return to and/or exceed pre-COVID-19 levels. Our latest estimates are that this recovery may occur in 2023 or 2024. New information may emerge concerning the scope, severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as any worsening of the pandemic, the effect of mutating strains and whether additional outbreaks of the pandemic will continue to occur, actions to contain the pandemic’s spread or treat its impact, timing of the availability of vaccines, and their distribution, acceptance and efficacy, and governmental, business and individual personal actions taken in response to the pandemic (including restrictions and limitations on travel and transportation, and changes in leisure and business travel patterns and work environments) among others. Some of these actions and related impacts may be trends that continue in the future even after the pandemic no longer poses a significant public health risk. We considered the deterioration in general economic and market conditions primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic to be a triggering event in the first and second quarters of 2020, requiring an impairment evaluation of goodwill, intangible assets and other assets in our commercial aerospace businesses, Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney. Beginning in the second quarter of 2020, we observed several airline customer bankruptcies, delays and cancellations of aircraft purchases by airlines, fleet retirements and repositioning of OEM production schedules and we experienced a significant decline in revenues at our Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney businesses due to a decline in flight hours, aircraft fleet utilization, shop visits and commercial OEM deliveries. These factors contributed to a deterioration of our expectations regarding the timing of a return to pre-COVID-19 commercial flight activity, which further reduced our future sales and cash flows expectations. Based on our updated forecast assumptions in the second quarter of 2020, we concluded that the carrying values of two of our Collins Aerospace reporting units were greater than their respective fair values, and accordingly, recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $ 3.2 billion. We did not identify any further deterioration to our expectations in the third quarter of 2020, and therefore, did not have a triggering event. We completed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of October 1, 2020 and determined that no additional adjustments to the carrying value of our goodwill were necessary. Refer to “Note 2: Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets” for additional information. Additionally, in 2020 we recorded write-downs of non-goodwill assets and significant unfavorable Estimate at Completion (EAC) adjustments in our Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney businesses primarily related to: • increased estimated credit losses on both our receivables and contract assets of $ 387 million, • an unfavorable EAC adjustment on a Pratt & Whitney commercial engine aftermarket contract due to lower estimated revenues driven by a change in the estimated maintenance coverage period of $ 334 million, • contract asset and inventory impairments at Collins Aerospace due to the impact of lower estimated future customer activity resulting from the expected acceleration of fleet retirements of a commercial aircraft of $ 146 million, • an unfavorable EAC adjustment of $ 129 million related to lower estimated revenues due to the restructuring of a customer contract at Pratt & Whitney, • an $ 89 million impairment of commercial aircraft program assets at Pratt & Whitney, • the impairment of a Collins Aerospace trade name of $ 57 million, 76 Table of C ontents • net unfavorable EAC adjustments on commercial aftermarket contracts at Pratt & Whitney based on a change in estimated future customer activity of $ 75 million, • an unfavorable EAC adjustment at Pratt & Whitney related to a shift in overhead costs to military contracts of $ 44 million, and • reserves related to a commercial financing arrangement at Pratt & Whitney of $ 43 million. As described further in “Note 8: Commercial Aerospace Industry Assets and Commitments,” we have significant exposure related to our airline and airframer customers, including significant accounts receivable and contract assets balances. Given the uncertainty related to the severity and length of the pandemic, as well as any worsening of the pandemic, mutations to the strains of the virus and the timing and impact of vaccines and whether there will be additional outbreaks of the pandemic and its impact across the aerospace industry, we may be required to record additional charges or impairments in future periods. Although the impact of COVID-19 on our commercial business is significant, we currently believe we have sufficient liquidity to withstand the current estimated impacts. Summary of Accounting Principles. As a result of the Raytheon Merger and the Separation Transactions, several of our accounting policies have been modified and certain additional polices have been added. The following represents the significant accounting principles of Raytheon Technologies Corporation. Consolidation and Classification. The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Raytheon Technologies Corporation, and all wholly owned, majority-owned and otherwise controlled domestic and foreign subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. For classification of certain current assets and liabilities, the duration of our contracts or programs is utilized to define our operating cycle, which is generally longer than one year. Included within our current assets and liabilities are contract assets and liabilities related to our aftermarket and development arrangements, which can generally span up to fifteen years. As a result of the Separation Transactions, the Distributions and the Raytheon Merger, certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications include the presentation of current assets and liabilities based upon the duration of our operating cycle, the reclassification of certain unbilled accounts receivable from accounts receivable, net to contract assets, reclassifications of lease amortization within our presentation of cash flows, reclassifications within our segment presentation, and the reclassification of the historical Carrier and Otis results to discontinued operations. Use of Estimates. Our Consolidated Financial statements are based on the application of U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial statements and the accompanying notes. As discussed above, the full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows, including sales, expenses, reserves and allowances, asset recoverability and EAC adjustments, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19 and related containment and treatment actions, as well as the economic impact on local, regional, national and international customers and markets. We have made estimates of the impact of COVID-19 within our financial statements and there may be changes to those estimates in future periods. Other future events, including COVID-19, and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and any such differences may be material to our Consolidated Financial statements. Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term cash investments that are highly liquid in nature and have original maturities of three months or less. The estimated fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates the carrying value due to their short maturities. On occasion, we are required to maintain cash deposits with certain banks with respect to contractual obligations related to acquisitions or divestitures or other legal obligations. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the amount of such restricted cash was approximately $ 30 million and $ 24 million, respectively. This restricted cash is excluded from cash and cash equivalents and is included in other assets, current and other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Accounts Receivable. Accounts receivable are stated at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for credit losses is established to provide for the expected lifetime credit losses by evaluating factors such as customer creditworthiness, historical payment and loss experiences, current economic conditions and the age and status of outstanding receivables. See the Accounting Pronouncements section below for additional information as to how we develop our allowance for credit losses under Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. 77 Table of C ontents Unbilled receivables represent revenues that are not currently billable to the customer under the terms of the contract and include unbilled amounts under commercial contracts where payment is solely subject to the passage of time. These items are expected to be billed and collected in the normal course of business. Accounts receivable as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 includes unbilled receivables of $ 228 million and $ 265 million, respectively, which primarily includes unbilled receivables with commercial aerospace customers. Other unbilled receivables not just subject to the passage of time are included in Contract assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and are generally classified as current. Contract Assets and Liabilities. Contract assets and liabilities represent the difference in the timing of revenue recognition from receipt of cash from our customers. Contract assets reflect revenue recognized and performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in advance of customer billing. Contract liabilities relate to payments received in advance of the satisfaction of performance under the contract. We receive payments from customers based on the terms established in our contracts. Contract assets and contract liabilities are generally classified as current as our operating cycle is generally longer than one year. See “Note 6: Contract Assets and Liabilities” for further discussion of contract assets and liabilities. Inventory. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value and is primarily based on first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost methods. Valuation reserves for excess, obsolete, and slow-moving inventory are estimated by comparing the inventory levels of individual parts to both future sales forecasts or production requirements and historical usage rates in order to identify inventory where the resale value or replacement value is less than inventoriable cost. Other factors that management considers in determining the adequacy of these reserves include whether individual inventory parts meet current specifications and can be substituted for a part currently being sold or used as a service part, overall market conditions, and other inventory management initiatives. Manufacturing costs are allocated to current production contracts. In our commercial aerospace businesses, excess costs beyond standard manufacturing costs are expensed when they meet certain thresholds. Equity Method Investments. Investments in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but do not control, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Under this method of accounting, our share of the net earnings or losses of the investee is included in Other income, net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations since the activities of the investee are closely aligned with the operations of the business segment holding the investment. We evaluate our equity method investments whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amounts of such investments may be impaired. If a decline in the value of an equity method investment is determined to be other than temporary, a loss is recorded in earnings in the current period. RTC sells products to and purchases products and services from unconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method, which are considered related parties. This activity is not considered material to the Consolidated Statement of Operations nor Consolidated Balance Sheet of RTC. Customer Financing Assets . Customer financing assets (CFA) relate to our commercial aerospace businesses in which we provide financing to airline customers. Our financing predominately relates to products under lease, and to a lesser extent, notes and lease receivables. In certain limited circumstances, we pay deposits on behalf of our airline customers to secure production slots with the airframers, and such pre-delivery payments are included in our notes receivables. Any unfunded pre-delivery payments are included within our commercial aerospace financing commitments as further discussed in “Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies.” We record revenue from lease assets by applying Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 842: Leases, and from interest income on the notes and lease receivables. Interest income from notes and financing leases and rental income from operating lease assets is generally included in Other income, net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations, while gains or losses on sales of operating lease assets are included in product sales and cost of sales. The current portion of these financing arrangements are aggregated in Other assets, current and the non-current portion of these financing arrangements are aggregated in CFA in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The increases and decreases in CFA from funding, receipts and certain other activity, are generally reflected as Investing Activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Leased assets are valued at cost and reviewed for impairment when circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Notes and lease receivables are valued at the net amount expected to be collected. For notes and lease receivables, we determine a specific reserve for exposure based on the difference between the carrying value of the receivable and the estimated fair value of the related collateral in connection with the evaluation of credit risk and collectability. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019 the reserves related to CFA were not material. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we did not have any significant balances that are considered to be delinquent, on non-accrual status, past due 90 days or more, or considered to be impaired. 78 Table of C ontents Business Combinations. Once a business is acquired, the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is determined with the excess cost recorded to goodwill. As required, a preliminary fair value is determined once a business is acquired, with the final determination of the fair value being completed no later than one year from the date of acquisition. In connection with the acquisitions of Rockwell Collins in 2018 and Goodrich in 2012, and to a lesser extent the acquisition of Raytheon Company in 2020, we recorded assumed liabilities related to customer contractual obligations on certain contracts with economic returns that were lower than what could be realized in market transactions as of the acquisition date. We measured these assumed liabilities based on the estimated cash flows of the programs plus a reasonable contracting profit margin required to transfer the contracts to market participants. These liabilities are being amortized in accordance with the underlying pattern of obligations, as reflected by the expenses incurred on the contracts. The balance of the contractual obligations was $ 1,243 million and $ 1,408 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Total consumption of the contractual obligations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $ 295 million, $ 345 million and $ 252 million, respectively, with future consumption expected to be as follows: $ 223 million in 2021, $ 119 million in 2022, $ 96 million in 2023, $ 115 million in 2024, $ 130 million in 2025 and $ 560 million thereafter. Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to impairment testing annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired. The goodwill impairment test compares carrying values of the reporting units to their estimated fair values. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value then the carrying value is reduced to fair value. In developing our estimates for the fair value of our reporting units and unamortized intangible assets, significant judgment is required in the determination of the appropriateness of using a qualitative assessment or quantitative assessment. For the quantitative assessments that are performed, fair value is primarily based on income approaches using a discounted cash flow method or relief from royalty method, which have significant assumptions including sales growth rates, projected operating profit, terminal growth rates, discount rates and royalty rates. Such assumptions are subject to variability from year to year and are directly impacted by, among other things, global market conditions. Finite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment when events occur that indicate that the net book value will not be recovered over future cash flows. Intangible assets consist of patents, trademarks/tradenames, customer relationships, exclusivity assets, developed technology and other intangible assets including collaboration assets. Acquired intangible assets are recognized at fair value in purchase accounting. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized to cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses over the applicable useful lives. Exclusivity assets are commercial aerospace payments made to secure certain contractual rights to provide product on new aircraft platforms. We classify amortization of such payments as a reduction of sales. Such payments are capitalized when there are distinct rights obtained and there are sufficient incremental cash flows to support the recoverability of the assets established. Otherwise, the applicable portion of the payments are expensed. In addition, in connection with our 2012 agreement to acquire Rolls-Royce’s ownership and collaboration interests in International Aero Engines AG (IAE), additional payments are due to Rolls-Royce contingent upon each hour flown through June 2027 by the V2500-powered aircraft in service as of the acquisition date. These flight hour payments are being capitalized as collaboration assets and amortized to cost of sales. Useful lives of finite-lived intangible assets are estimated based upon the nature of the intangible asset and the industry in which the intangible asset is used. These intangible assets are amortized based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed, as represented by the underlying cash flows, which may result in an amortization method other than straight-line. For both our commercial aerospace collaboration assets and exclusivity arrangements, the pattern of economic benefit generally results in no amortization during the development period with amortization beginning as programs enter full rate production and aftermarket cycles. If a pattern of economic benefit cannot be reliably determined or if straight-line amortization approximates the pattern of economic benefit, a straight-line amortization method may be used. The range of estimated useful lives is as follows: Years Collaboration assets 30 Customer relationships and related programs 3 to 32 Developed technology 15 to 25 Patents and trademarks 4 to 30 Exclusivity assets 5 to 25 Leases. We account for leases in accordance with ASC Topic 842: Leases, which we adopted on January 1, 2019. As a lessee, we record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 79 Table of C ontents months. Leases are classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. We enter into lease agreements for the use of real estate space, vehicles, information technology equipment, and certain other equipment under both operating and finance leases. We determine if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in Operating lease right-of-use assets, Accrued liabilities for the current portion of our operating lease liabilities, and Operating lease liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Finance leases are not considered significant to our Consolidated Balance Sheet or Consolidated Statement of Operations. Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments, and use the implicit rate when readily determinable. We determine our incremental borrowing rate through market sources including relevant industry rates. Our lease right-of-use assets also include any initial direct costs and lease pre-payments made at or before the commencement date and are reduced for any lease incentives received at or before the commencement date. Certain of our leases include variable payments, which may vary based upon changes in facts or circumstances after the start of the lease. We exclude variable payments from lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, to the extent not considered fixed, and instead, expense variable payments as incurred. Variable lease expense and lease expense for short duration contracts are not a material component of lease expense. Some of our leases include the option to extend or terminate the lease. We include these options in the recognition of our right-of-use assets and lease liabilities when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option. Lease expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In limited instances we act as a lessor, primarily for commercial aerospace engines, the majority of which are classified as operating leases. These leases are not significant to our Consolidated Balance Sheet or Consolidated Statement of Operations. Other Long-Lived Assets. We evaluate the potential impairment of other long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of other long-lived assets held and used exceeds the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows, the carrying value is written down to fair value. In order for long-lived assets to be considered held for disposal, we must have committed to a plan to dispose of the assets. Once deemed held for disposal, the assets are stated at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value. Income Taxes. Future income taxes represent the tax effects of transactions which are reported in different periods for tax and financial reporting purposes. These amounts consist of the tax effects of temporary differences between the tax and financial reporting balance sheets and tax carryforwards. Future income tax benefits and payables within the same tax paying component of a particular jurisdiction are offset for presentation in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. I n the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax positions. We assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. Where applicable, associated interest expense has also been recognized. We recognize accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense. Penalties, if incurred, would be recognized as a component of income tax expense. State income tax amounts are generally included in income tax expense; however state income tax payments related to our Raytheon Intelligence & Space (RIS) and Raytheon Missiles & Defense (RMD) segments are generally recoverable through the pricing of products and services to the U.S. government. Accordingly, these state income taxes are generally allocated to contracts and reclassified to Selling, general and administrative expenses when paid (recovered) or otherwise agreed as allocable with the U.S. government. We have elected to account for tax on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income ( GILTI) as a period cost, as incurred. Revenue Recognition. The vast majority of our revenues are from long-term contracts associated with the design, development, manufacture or modification of complex aerospace or defense equipment or related services. Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney primarily serve commercial and government customers in both the OEM and aftermarket parts and services markets of the aerospace industry, while RIS and RMD primarily provide products and services to government customers in the defense industry. We account for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. For certain contracts that meet the foregoing requirements, primarily contracts that are directly with a foreign government, we are required 80 Table of C ontents to obtain certain regulatory approvals. In these cases, we recognize revenue based on the likelihood of obtaining regulatory approvals based upon all known facts and circumstances. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. Some of our contracts with customers contain a single performance obligation, while others contain multiple performance obligations most commonly when a contract contains multiple distinct units (such as engines or certain aerospace components) or spans multiple phases of the product life-cycle such as production, maintenance and support. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as the performance obligation is satisfied. When there are multiple performance obligations within a contract, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on its standalone selling price when available. If standalone selling price is not available, we estimate the standalone selling price of each performance obligation, which is generally based on an expected cost plus a margin approach. We consider the contractual consideration payable by the customer and assess variable consideration that may affect the total transaction price, including contractual discounts, contract incentive payments, estimates of award fees, flight hours, aircraft landings or other customer usage activities on long term maintenance contracts, and other sources of variable consideration, when determining the transaction price of each contract. When reasonably able to estimate, we include variable consideration in the transaction price at the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled. We include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. These estimates are based on historical experience, anticipated performance and our best judgment at the time. We also consider whether our contracts contain a significant financing component, which they generally do not. Timing of the satisfaction of performance obligations varies across our businesses due to our diverse product and service mix, customer base, and contractual terms. Performance obligations are satisfied as of a point in time for certain aerospace components, engines, and spare parts. Revenue is recognized when control of the product transfers to the customer, generally upon product shipment. Since billing also typically occurs upon product shipment, we generally do not have contract assets or contract liabilities balances related to point in time sales. Performance obligations are satisfied over-time if the customer receives the benefits as we perform work, if the customer controls the asset as it is being produced (continuous transfer of control), or if the product being produced for the customer has no alternative use and we have a contractual right to payment for performance to date. We recognize revenue on an over-time basis for substantially all defense contracts and certain long-term aerospace OEM and aftermarket contracts. Substantially all of our defense business revenue, which primarily relates to our RIS and RMD segments, and to a lesser extent Pratt & Whitney and Collins Aerospace, is recognized over time because of the continuous transfer of control to our customers. For performance obligations satisfied over time, revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress. Incurred costs represent work performed, which correspond with and best depict transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs can include labor, materials, subcontractors’ costs, or other direct costs and indirect costs. Our contracts with the U.S. government are typically subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and are priced based on estimated or actual costs of producing goods or providing services. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services provided under U.S. government contracts. The pricing for non-U.S. government contracts is based on the specific negotiations with each customer. Under the typical payment terms of our U.S. government fixed-price contracts, the customer pays us either performance-based payments (PBPs) or progress payments. PBPs are interim payments equal to a negotiated percentage of the contract price based on quantifiable measures of performance or on the achievement of specified events or milestones. Progress payments are interim payments up to 80-90% of costs incurred as the work progresses. Because the customer retains a portion of the contract price until completion of the contract, our U.S. government fixed-price contracts generally result in revenue recognized in excess of billings which we present as Contract assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For our U.S. government cost-type contracts, the customer generally pays us for our costs incurred within a short period of time. For non-U.S. government contracts, we typically receive interim payments as work progresses, although for some contracts, we may be entitled to receive an advance payment. Such advances are not considered a significant financing component because they are used to meet working capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract and to protect us from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract. We recognize a liability for advance payments in excess of revenue recognized and present it as Contract liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For certain of our long-term aftermarket contracts, revenue is recognized over the contract period. We generally account for such contracts as a series of daily performance obligations to stand ready to provide spare parts, product maintenance and aftermarket services. These arrangements include the sale of spare parts with integral services to our customers, and are generally classified as Service sales, with the corresponding costs classified in Cost of services sold, within the Consolidated 81 Table of C ontents Statement of Operations. Revenue is primarily recognized on a percentage of completion basis using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress, as sufficient historical evidence indicates that the cost of performing services under the contract is incurred on an other-than-straight-line basis. For some of our long-term aftermarket contracts, we receive payment prior to delivery of products and services, resulting in a contract liability balance, while for others, we deliver products or services in advance of payment, resulting in a contract asset balance. Contracts are often modified to account for changes in contract specifications or requirements. We consider contract modifications to exist when the modification either creates new or changes existing enforceable rights and obligations. Contract modifications for goods or services that are not distinct are accounted for as part of the existing contract either on a cumulative catch-up basis or prospective basis depending on the nature of the modification. Loss provisions on contracts are recognized to the extent that estimated contract costs exceed the estimated consideration from the products or services contemplated under the contractual arrangement. For new commitments, we generally record loss provisions at contract signing except for certain contracts under which losses are recorded upon receipt of the purchase order that obligates us to perform. For existing commitments, anticipated losses on contractual arrangements are recognized in the period in which losses become evident. In estimating losses, products contemplated under contractual arrangements include firm quantities of product sold under contract and, in the commercial engine and wheels and brakes businesses, future highly probable sales of replacement parts required by regulation that are expected to be sold subsequently for incorporation into the original equipment. In our commercial engine and wheels and brakes businesses, when the OEM product is sold for a loss, but the combined OEM and aftermarket arrangement for each individual sales campaign is profitable, we record OEM product losses at the time of product delivery. We review our Estimate at Completion (EACs) on significant contracts on a periodic basis and for others, no less than annually or when a change in circumstances warrant a modification to a previous estimate. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of the Company’s performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment by management on a contract by contract basis. As part of this process, management reviews information including, but not limited to, any outstanding key contract matters, progress towards completion and the related program schedule, identified risks and opportunities and the related changes in estimates of revenues and costs. The risks and opportunities relate to management’s judgment about the ability and cost to achieve the schedule, consideration of customer-directed delays or reductions in scheduled deliveries, technical requirements, customer activity levels, such as flight hours or aircraft landings, and related variable consideration. Management’s judgment related to these considerations has become increasingly more significant given the current economic environment primarily caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Management must make assumptions and estimates regarding contract revenue and costs, including estimates of labor productivity and availability, the complexity and scope of the work to be performed, the availability and cost of materials, the length of time to complete the performance obligation, execution by our subcontractors, the availability and timing of funding from our customer, overhead cost rates, and current and past maintenance cost and frequency driven by estimated aircraft and engine utilization and estimated useful lives of components, among others. Cost estimates may also include the estimated cost of satisfying our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes in the form of either offset obligations or in-country industrial participation (ICIP) agreements, required under certain contracts primarily within our RIS and RMD segments. These obligations may or may not be distinct depending on their nature. If cash is paid to a customer to satisfy our offset obligations it is recorded as a reduction in the transaction price. Changes in estimates of net sales, cost of sales and the related impact to operating profit on contracts recognized over time are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis, which recognizes the cumulative effect of the profit changes on current and prior periods based on a performance obligation’s percentage of completion in the current period. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of our performance obligations. Our EAC adjustments also include the establishment of loss provisions for our contracts accounted for on a percentage of completion basis. Net EAC adjustments had the following impact on our operating results: (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2020 2019 2018 Operating profit (loss) $ ( 643 ) $ ( 69 ) $ ( 50 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners (1) ( 508 ) ( 55 ) ( 40 ) Diluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners (1) $ ( 0.37 ) $ ( 0.06 ) $ ( 0.05 ) (1) Amounts reflect a U.S. statutory tax rate of 21%, which approximates our tax rate on our EAC adjustments. For additional discussion on significant unfavorable EAC adjustments see the COVID-19 Pandemic discussion above. In 2020, 2019 and 2018, revenue was reduced by a net of $ 407 million, $ 106 million and increased by $ 72 million, respectively, for 82 Table of C ontents performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous periods. This primarily relates to EAC adjustments that impacted revenue. As a result of the Raytheon Merger, Raytheon Company’s contracts accounted for on a percentage of completion basis were reset to zero percent complete as of the date of completion of the Raytheon Merger, since only the unperformed portion of the contract at such date represents an obligation of the Company. This will have the impact of reducing gross favorable and unfavorable EAC adjustments for these segments in the short-term, with the exception of EAC adjustments related to loss contracts. For additional information related to the Raytheon Merger, see “Note 2: Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets.” In our Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney businesses, we incur contract fulfillment costs for engineering and development of aerospace OEM products directly related to existing or anticipated contracts with customers. Such costs generate or enhance our ability to satisfy our performance obligations under these contracts. We capitalize these costs as contract fulfillment costs to the extent the costs are recoverable from the associated contract margin and customer funding, and subsequently amortize the costs as the related performance obligations are satisfied. In instances where intellectual property does not transfer to the customer, we generally defer the customer funding of product engineering and development and recognize revenue when the related performance obligations are satisfied. Capitalized contract fulfillment costs were $ 1,981 million and $ 1,519 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively and are classified in Other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheet and are included in Other operating activities, net in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. We regularly assess capitalized contract fulfillment costs for impairment. We had $ 111 million of impairment for contract fulfillment costs in 2020, and had no impairment in 2019 or 2018. Costs to obtain contracts are not material. In view of the risks and costs associated with developing new engines and the large up-front investments required that often require returns generated over the full estimated life of the engine, Pratt & Whitney has entered into certain collaboration arrangements in which sales, costs and risks are shared. Sales generated from engine programs, spare parts sales, and aftermarket business under these collaboration arrangements are recorded consistent with our revenue recognition policies in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Amounts attributable to our collaborators for their share of sales are recorded as cost of sales in our Consolidated Financial Statements based upon the terms and nature of the arrangement. Costs associated with engine programs under collaborative arrangements are expensed as incurred. Under these arrangements, collaborators contribute their program share of engine parts, incur their own production costs and make certain payments for shared or joint program costs. The reimbursement from collaborators of their share of program costs is recorded as a reduction of the related expense item at that time. As of December 31, 2020, the collaborators’ interests in all commercial engine programs ranged from 13 % to 49 %, inclusive of a portion of Pratt & Whitney’s interests held by other participants. Pratt & Whitney is the principal participant in all existing collaborative arrangements, with the exception of the Engine Alliance (EA), a joint venture with GE Aviation, which markets and manufactures the GP7000 engine for the Airbus A380 aircraft. There are no individually significant collaborative arrangements, and none of the collaborators individually have more than a 31 % share in an individual program. The following table illustrates the Consolidated Statement of Operations classification and amounts attributable to transactions arising from the collaborative arrangements between participants for each period presented. (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Collaborator share of sales: Cost of products sold $ 1,183 $ 2,097 $ 1,688 Cost of services sold 1,374 1,674 1,765 Collaborator share of program costs (reimbursement of expenses incurred): Cost of products sold ( 147 ) ( 190 ) ( 209 ) Research and development ( 177 ) ( 219 ) ( 225 ) Selling, general and administrative ( 99 ) ( 101 ) ( 87 ) In our Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney businesses, we may offer customers incentives to purchase our products, which may result in payments made to those customers, which are treated as a reduction in sales. Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO). RPO represents the aggregate amount of total contract transaction price that is unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied. Total RPO was $ 150.1 billion as of December 31, 2020. Of the total RPO as of December 31, 2020, we expect approximately 30 % will be recognized as sales over the next 12 months. This percentage of RPO to be recognized as sales over the next 12 months depends on our current estimates of future developments, which are highly uncertain, and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the scope, severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, actions to contain its spread or treat its impact, and governmental, business and individuals’ actions taken in response to the pandemic, which may result in customer delays or order cancellations. 83 Table of C ontents Research and Development. Company-sponsored research and development costs, including those costs related to the Company’s portion in connection with cost-sharing arrangements, are charged to expense as incurred and recovery on these cost-sharing arrangements is recorded as a reduction to research and development expense as earned. Customer-sponsored research and development projects performed under contracts with customers are accounted for as contract costs and reported as cost of sales on the related revenue generating contracts. Foreign Exchange. We conduct business in many different currencies and, accordingly, are subject to the inherent risks associated with foreign exchange rate movements. The financial position and results of operations of many of our foreign subsidiaries are often measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at the exchange rates existing at the respective balance sheet dates, and income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates during the respective periods. The aggregate effects of translating the balance sheets of these subsidiaries are deferred as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL) in shareowners’ equity. Derivatives and Hedging Activity. We use derivative instruments, including swaps, forward contracts and options, to help manage certain foreign currency, and from time to time to help manage interest rate and commodity price exposures. Derivative instruments are viewed as risk management tools by us and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. By their nature, all financial instruments involve market and credit risks. We enter into derivative and other financial instruments with major investment grade financial institutions and have policies to monitor the credit risk of those counterparties. We limit counterparty exposure and concentration of risk by diversifying counterparties. While there can be no assurance, we do not anticipate any material non-performance by any of these counterparties. We enter into transactions that are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements with various counterparties. However, we have not elected to offset multiple contracts with a single counterparty and, as a result, the fair value of the derivative instruments in a loss position is not offset against the fair value of derivative instruments in a gain position. Derivatives used for hedging purposes may be designated and effective as a hedge of the identified risk exposure at the inception of the contract. All derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives used to hedge foreign currency denominated balance sheet items are reported directly in earnings along with offsetting transaction gains and losses on the items being hedged. Derivatives used to hedge forecasted cash flows associated with foreign currency commitments or forecasted commodity purchases may be accounted for as cash flow hedges, as deemed appropriate. Gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified to earnings as a component of product sales or expenses, as applicable, when the hedged transaction occurs. Cash payments or receipts on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in Other operating activities, net within the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. To the extent that a previously designated hedging transa ction is no longer an effective hedge, any ineffectiveness measured in the hedging relationship is recorded currently in earnings in the period it occurs. To the extent the hedge accounting criteria are not met, the foreign currency forward contracts are utilized as economic hedges and changes in the fair value of these contracts are recorded currently in earnings in the period in which they occur. Cash receipts or payments related to the settlement of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded as investing cash flows within the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Additional information pertaining to foreign currency forward contracts and net investment hedging is included in “Note 15: Financial Instruments.” Environmental . Environmental investigatory, remediation, operating and maintenance costs are accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site, including existing technology, current laws and regulations and prior remediation experience. Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, the minimum is accrued. For sites with multiple responsible parties, we consider our likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation costs and the ability of the other parties to fulfill their obligations in establishing a provision for those costs. Liabilities with fixed or reliably determinable future cash payments are discounted. A portion of these costs is eligible for future recovery through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government. We regularly assess the probability of recovery of these costs, which requires us to make assumptions about the extent of cost recovery under our contracts and the amount of future contract activity with the U.S. government. We consider such recovery probable based on government contracting regulations and our history of receiving reimbursement for such costs, and accordingly have recorded the future recovery of these costs from the U.S. government within Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Accrued environmental liabilities are not reduced by potential insurance reimbursements or potential recoveries from pursuing other parties. See “Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies” for additional details on the environmental remediation activities. Pension and Postretirement Obligations. U.S. GAAP requires balance sheet recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of pension and postretirement benefit (PRB) plans. Funded status is measured at least annually in the fourth quarter and represents the difference between the plans’ projected benefit obligation (PBO) and the fair market value of the plans’ assets. 84 Table of C ontents Changes to our pension and PRB plans’ funded status can result from company actions, such as contributions or changes in plan provisions, or by gains and losses. Gains and losses are primarily a result of changes in assumptions and actual experience that differs from these assumptions. Major assumptions include the discount rate and expected return on plan assets (EROA). These gains or losses are recorded in other comprehensive income, net of tax effects, until they are amortized as a component of net periodic benefit (income) expense. A calculated “market-related value” of our plan assets is used to develop the amount of deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized. The market-related value of assets is equal to the fair value of assets adjusted to reflect the recognition, and subsequent amortization, of the difference between actual and expected asset returns over a five-year period. The market-related value of assets is used to calculate the expected return on assets included in the net periodic benefit (income) expense. The Company has elected to use the “corridor” approach in the amortization of gains and losses, which limits the expense recognition to the net outstanding gains and losses in excess of the greater of 10% of the PBO or 10% of the market-related value of assets. Gains and losses exceeding the corridor are amortized in net periodic benefit (income) expense over either the projected average remaining employee service period or the projected average remaining lifetime of inactive participants depending on the plan. Net periodic benefit (income) expense is split between operating profit and non-operating income, whereby only the service cost component is included in operating profit and the remaining components are included in Non-service pension (income) expense. Product Performance Obligations. We extend performance and operating cost guarantees beyond our normal service and warranty policies for extended periods on some of our products, particularly commercial aircraft engines. Liability under such guarantees is based upon future product performance and durability. We accrue for such costs that are probable and can be reasonably estimated. In addition, we incur discretionary costs to service our products in connection with product performance issues. The costs associated with these product performance and operating cost guarantees require estimates over the full terms of the agreements, and require management to consider factors such as the extent of future maintenance requirements, interval between flight and repair time and the future cost of material and labor to perform the services. These cost estimates are largely based upon historical experience. See “Note 18: Guarantees” for further discussion. Accounting Pronouncements. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. This ASU and its related amendments (collectively, the Credit Loss Standard) modifies the impairment model to utilize an expected loss methodology in place of the incurred loss methodology for financial instruments, including trade receivables, contract assets and off-balance sheet credit exposures. The Credit Loss Standard requires consideration of a broader range of information to estimate expected credit losses, including historical information, current economic conditions and a reasonable forecast period. This ASU requires that the statement of operations reflect estimates of expected credit losses for newly recognized financial assets as well as changes in the estimate of expected credit losses that have taken place during the period, which may result in earlier recognition of certain losses. We adopted this standard effective January 1, 2020 utilizing a modified retrospective approach. A cumulative-effect non-cash adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2020 was recorded in the amount of $ 59 million. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. We are exposed to credit losses primarily through our sales of products and services to commercial customers which are recorded as trade receivables, contract assets, long-term receivables, and notes and lease receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We do not have any significant exposure for credit losses related to sales of products and services to our government customers. Our method for developing our allowance for credit losses involves making informed judgments regarding whether an adjustment is necessary to our historical loss experiences to reflect our expectations around current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecast periods, where applicable. We utilize current economic market data as well as other internal and external information available to us to inform our decision making. In certain circumstances we may be able to develop reasonable and supportable forecasts over the contractual term of the financial asset or off-balance sheet exposure. For periods beyond which we are able to make or obtain reasonable and supportable forecasts, we revert to historical loss experience and information. We determine credit ratings for each customer in our portfolio based upon public information and information obtained directly from our customers. We conduct a review of customer credit ratings, published historical credit default rates for different rating categories, and multiple third-party aircraft value publications as a basis to validate the reasonableness of the allowance for credit losses on these balances quarterly or when events and circumstances warrant. In addition to credit quality indicators, factors considered in our evaluation of assessing collectability and risk include: underlying value of any collateral or security interests, significant past due balances, historical losses, and existing economic conditions, including geographic and political risk. A credit limit is established for each customer based on the outcome of this review. Customer credit ratings range from 85 Table of C ontents customers with an extremely strong capacity to meet financial obligations, to customers whose uncollateralized receivable is in default. We may require collateral or prepayment to mitigate credit risk. To estimate expected credit losses of financial assets with similar risk characteristics, we determine an asset is impaired when, based on historical experience, current information and a reasonable forecast period, there is risk that we will be unable to collect amounts due according to the contractual terms of the agreement. We monitor our ongoing credit exposure through reviews of customer balances against contract terms and due dates, current economic conditions, and dispute resolution. Estimated credit losses are written off in the period in which the financial asset is no longer collectible. We can also be exposed to credit losses from off-balance sheet exposures, such as certain financial guarantees and financing commitments. We have assessed these potential exposures and concluded that there are no material associated credit losses as of December 31, 2020. In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. The amendments in this update remove certain exceptions of Topic 740 including: exception to the incremental approach for intraperiod tax allocation when there is a loss from continuing operations and income or gain from other items; exception to the requirement to recognize a deferred tax liability for equity method investments when a foreign subsidiary becomes an equity method investment; exception to the ability not to recognize a deferred tax liability for a foreign subsidiary when a foreign equity method investment becomes a subsidiary; exception to the general methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period when a year-to-date loss exceeds the anticipated loss for the year. There are also additional areas of guidance in regards to: franchise and other taxes partially based on income and the interim recognition of enactment of tax laws and rate changes. The provisions of this ASU are effective for years beginning after December 15, 2020. We are currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Other new pronouncements issued but not effective until after December 31, 2020 did not and are not expected to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. NOTE 2: BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS, GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS Business Acquisitions. Our investments in businesses net of cash acquired in 2020, 2019 and 2018 totaled $ 35,077 million (including debt assumed of $ 4,700 million and stock issued of $ 33,166 million), $ 9 million, and $ 30,783 million (including debt assumed of $ 7,784 million and stock issued of $ 7,960 million) respectively. Our investments in businesses in 2020 and 2018 primarily consisted of the acquisition of Raytheon Company and Rockwell Collins, Inc. (Rockwell Collins), respectively. Raytheon Merger. As noted above, on April 3, 2020, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated June 9, 2019, as amended (the Raytheon Merger Agreement) UTC and Raytheon Company completed their previously announced all-stock merger of equals, following the completion by UTC of the Separation Transactions and Distributions. Raytheon Company (previously New York Stock Exchange (NYSE): RTN) shares ceased trading prior to the market open on April 3, 2020, and each share of Raytheon common stock was converted in the merger into the right to receive 2.3348 shares of UTC common stock previously traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “UTX.” Upon closing of the Raytheon Merger, UTC’s name was changed to “Raytheon Technologies Corporation,” and its shares of common stock began trading as of April 3, 2020 on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “RTX.” Total consideration is calculated as follows: (dollars in millions) Amount Fair value of RTC common stock issued for Raytheon Company outstanding common stock and vested equity awards $ 33,067 Fair value attributable to pre-merger service for replacement equity awards 99 Total merger consideration $ 33,166 86 Table of C ontents The fair value of RTC common stock issued for Raytheon Company outstanding common stock and vested equity awards is calculated as follows: (dollars and shares in millions, except per share amounts and exchange ratio) Amount Number of Raytheon Company common shares outstanding as of April 3, 2020 277.3 Number of Raytheon Company stock awards vested as a result of the Raytheon Merger (1) 0.4 Total outstanding shares of Raytheon Company common stock and equity awards entitled to merger consideration 277.7 Exchange ratio (2) 2.3348 Shares of RTC common stock issued for Raytheon Company outstanding common stock and vested equity awards 648.4 Price per share of RTC common stock (3) $ 51.00 Fair value of RTC common stock issued for Raytheon Company outstanding common stock and vested equity awards $ 33,067 (1) Represents Raytheon Company stock awards that vested as a result of the Raytheon Merger, which is considered a “change in control” for purposes of the Raytheon 2010 Stock Plan. Certain Raytheon Company restricted stock awards and Raytheon Company restricted stock unit (RSU) awards, issued under the Raytheon 2010 Stock Plan vested on an accelerated basis as a result of the Raytheon Merger. Such vested awards were converted into the right to receive RTC common stock determined as the product of (1) the number of vested awards, and (2) the exchange ratio. (2) The exchange ratio is equal to 2.3348 shares of UTC common stock for each share of Raytheon Company common stock in accordance with the Raytheon Merger Agreement. (3) The price per share of RTC common stock is based on the RTC opening stock price as of April 3, 2020. Preliminary Allocation of Consideration Transferred to Net Assets Acquired. We are accounting for the Raytheon Merger under the acquisition method and are required to measure identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed of the acquiree (Raytheon Company) at the fair values on the closing date. The following amounts represent the preliminary determination of the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the Raytheon Merger. As of December 31, 2020, the majority of the valuation studies necessary to determine the fair market value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been reviewed and finalized; however, our assessment of certain c ontingencies including environm ental liabilities, pension and postretirement benefit obligations and taxes remain open for completion of the related valuation analyses. We expect to finalize the purchase price allocation process in the first quarter of 2021 when we finalize our valuations and reviews. 87 Table of C ontents Any potential adjustments made could be material in relation to the preliminary values presented below. (dollars in millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,208 Accounts receivable 1,997 Inventory 705 Contract assets 6,023 Other assets, current 940 Fixed assets 4,745 Operating lease right-of-use assets 950 Intangible assets: 19,130 Customer relationships 12,900 Tradenames/trademarks 5,430 Developed technology 800 Other assets 1,193 Total identifiable assets acquired 38,891 Accounts payable 1,455 Accrued employee compensation 1,492 Other accrued liabilities 1,797 Contract liabilities 2,991 Long-term debt, including current portion 4,700 Operating lease liabilities, non-current portion 738 Future pension and postretirement benefit obligation 11,621 Other long-term liabilities 2,425 Total liabilities acquired 27,219 Total identifiable net assets 11,672 Goodwill 21,528 Redeemable noncontrolling interest ( 34 ) Total consideration transferred $ 33,166 Fair value adjustments to Raytheon Company’s identified assets and liabilities included an increase in fixed assets of $ 1.1 billion. Fair value adjustments also included a preliminarily estimated increase to future pension and postretirement benefit obligations of $ 3.6 billion, primarily related to remeasurement of the liability based on market conditions on the Raytheon Merger closing date, which includes an incremental adjustment of $ 980 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, principally due to a refinement of our demographic assumptions. For further information, see “Note 11: Employee Benefit Plans.” In determining the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, a review was conducted for any significant contingent assets or liabilities existing as of such closing date. The preliminary assessment did not note any significant contingencies related to existing legal or government action. The fair values of the customer relationship intangible assets were determined by using a discounted cash flow valuation method, which is a form of the income approach. Under this approach, the estimated future cash flows attributable to the asset are adjusted to exclude the future cash flows that can be attributed to supporting assets, such as trade names or fixed assets. Both the amount and the duration of the cash flows are considered from a market participant perspective. Our estimates of market participant future cash flows, which require significant management judgment, included forecasted revenue growth rates, remaining developmental effort, operational performance including company specific synergies, program life cycles, material and labor pricing, and other relevant customer, contractual and market factors. Where appropriate, the net cash flows are probability-adjusted to reflect the uncertainties associated with the underlying assumptions, including cancellation rates related to backlog, government demand for sole-source and recompete contracts and win rates for recompete contracts, as well as the risk profile of the net cash flows utilized in the valuation. The probability-adjusted future cash flows are then discounted to present value, using an appropriate discount rate that requires significant judgment by management. The customer relationship intangible assets are being amortized based on the pattern of economic benefits we expect to realize over the estimated economic life of the underlying programs. The fair value of the tradename intangible assets were determined utilizing the relief from royalty method which is a form of the income approach. Under this method, a royalty rate based on observed market royalties is applied to projected revenue supporting the tradename and discounted to present value, using forecasted revenue growth rate projections and a discount rate, respectively, that requires significant judgment by management. The 88 Table of C ontents tradename intangible assets have been determined to have an indefinite life. The developed technology intangible assets are being amortized based on the pattern of economic benefits. The intangible assets included above consist of the following: (dollars in millions) Estimated Fair Value Estimated Life Acquired customer relationships $ 12,900 25 years Acquired tradenames 5,430 Indefinite Acquired developed technology 800 5 to 7 years Total identifiable intangible assets $ 19,130 We also identified customer contractual obligations on loss making programs and recorded liabilities of $ 222 million related to these programs based on the difference between the actual expected operating loss and a normalized operating profit. These liabilities will be liquidated based on the expected pattern of expenses incurred on these contracts. We recorded $ 21.5 billion of goodwill as a result of the Raytheon Merger which primarily relates to expected synergies from combining operations and the value of the existing workforce. The goodwill generated as a result of the Raytheon Merger is nondeductible for tax purposes. Merger-Related Costs. Merger-related costs have been expensed as incurred. In 2020, approximately $ 142 million, of transaction and integration costs have been incurred which excludes $ 23 million of transaction costs related to the divestitures required for regulatory approval discussed further in Dispositions below. These costs were recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Supplemental Pro-Forma Data. Raytheon Company’s results of operations have been included in RTC’s financial statements for the period subsequent to the completion of the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020. The following unaudited supplemental pro-forma data presents consolidated information as if the Raytheon Merger had been completed on January 1, 2019. The pro-forma results were calculated by combining the results of Raytheon Technologies with the stand-alone results of Raytheon Company for the pre-acquisition periods, which were adjusted to account for certain costs that would have been incurred during this pre-acquisition period. The results below reflect Raytheon Technologies on a continuing operations basis, in order to more accurately represent the structure of Raytheon Technologies after completion of the Separation Transactions and the Raytheon Merger. (dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 2020 2019 Net sales $ 64,087 $ 74,238 Income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners ( 2,167 ) 6,544 Basic earnings (loss) per share of common stock from continuing operations $ ( 1.43 ) $ 4.34 Diluted earnings (loss) per share of common stock from continuing operations ( 1.43 ) 4.31 The unaudited supplemental pro-forma data above includes the following significant adjustments made to account for certain costs which would have been incurred if the acquisition had been completed on January 1, 2019, as adjusted for the applicable tax impact. As the merger was completed on April 3, 2020, the pro-forma adjustments in the table below only include the required adjustments through April 3, 2020. (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 Amortization of acquired Raytheon Company intangible assets, net (1) $ ( 270 ) $ ( 1,048 ) Amortization of fixed asset fair value adjustment (2) ( 9 ) ( 38 ) Utilization of contractual customer obligation (3) 8 57 Deferred revenue fair value adjustment (4) ( 4 ) ( 33 ) Adjustment to non-service pension (income) expense (5) 239 832 RTC/Raytheon fees for advisory, legal, accounting services (6) 134 ( 134 ) Adjustment to interest expense related to the Raytheon Merger, net (7) 9 36 Elimination of deferred commission amortization (8) 5 20 $ 112 $ ( 308 ) (1) Reflects the additional amortization of the acquired Raytheon Company’s intangible assets recognized at fair value in purchase accounting and eliminates the historical Raytheon Company intangible asset amortization expense. (2) Reflects the amortization of the fixed asset fair value adjustment as of the acquisition date. (3) Reflects the additional amortization of liabilities recognized for certain acquired loss making contracts as of the acquisition date. (4) Reflects the difference between prepayments related to extended arrangements and the preliminary fair value of the assumed performance obligations as they are satisfied. 89 Table of C ontents (5) Represents the elimination of unamortized prior service costs and actuarial losses, as a result of fair value purchase accounting. (6) Reflects the elimination of transaction-related fees incurred by RTC and Raytheon Company in connection with the Raytheon Merger and assumes all of the fees were incurred during the first quarter of 2019. (7) Reflects the amortization of the fair market value adjustment related to Raytheon Company. (8) Reflects the elimination of amortization recognized on deferred commissions that are eliminated in purchase accounting. The unaudited supplemental pro-forma financial information does not reflect the potential realization of cost savings related to the integration of the two companies. Further, the pro-forma data should not be considered indicative of the results that would have occurred if the acquisition had been consummated on January 1, 2019, nor are they indicative of future results. In December 2020, we completed the acquisition of Blue Canyon Technologies, a leading provider of small satellites and spacecraft systems components, for $ 426 million, net of cash received. Blue Canyon Technologies is reported in the Raytheon Intelligence & Space segment. In connection with this acquisition, we preliminarily recorded $ 266 million of goodwill, primarily related to expected synergies from combining operations and the value of the existing workforce, which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes, and $ 141 million of intangible assets, primarily related to customer relationships. The purchase price allocation process is expected to be complete in 2021 after the conclusion of our final reviews. Rockwell Collins Acquisition. On November 26, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Rockwell Collins (the Rockwell Acquisition), a leader in aviation and high-integrity solutions for commercial and military customers as well as leading-edge avionics, flight controls, aircraft interior and data connectivity solutions. Under the terms of the Rockwell acquisition agreement, each share of common stock, par value $ 0.01 per share, of Rockwell Collins issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Rockwell Acquisition (other than shares held by Rockwell Collins, the Company, Riveter Merger Sub Corp or any of their respective wholly owned subsidiaries) was converted into the right to receive (1) $ 93.33 in cash, without interest, and (2) 0.37525 shares of Company common stock (together, the Acquisition Consideration), less any applicable withholding taxes, with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares. The total aggregate consideration payable in the Rockwell Acquisition was $ 15.5 billion in cash ($ 14.9 billion net of cash acquired) and 62.2 million shares of Company common stock. In addition, $ 7.8 billion of Rockwell Collins debt was outstanding at the time of the Rockwell Acquisition. This equated to a total enterprise value of $ 30.6 billion, including the $ 7.8 billion of Rockwell Collins’ outstanding debt. (dollars in millions) Amount Cash consideration paid for Rockwell Collins outstanding common stock & equity awards $ 15,533 Fair value of UTC common stock issued for Rockwell Collins outstanding common stock & equity awards 7,960 Total consideration transferred $ 23,493 The cash consideration utilized for the Rockwell Acquisition was partially financed through the issuance of $ 11.0 billion aggregate principal notes on August 16, 2018 for net proceeds of $ 10.9 billion. For the remainder of the cash consideration, we utilized repatriated cash and cash equivalents and cash flow generated from operating activities. Acquisition-Related Costs. Acquisition-related costs have been expensed as incurred. In 2019 and 2018, $ 40 million and $ 112 million, respectively, of transaction and integration costs have been incurred related to the Rockwell Acquisition. These costs were recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Supplemental Pro-Forma Data. Rockwell Collins’ results of operations have been included in RTC’s financial statements for the period subsequent to the completion of the acquisition on N ovember 26, 2018. Rockwell Collins contributed sales of approximately $ 778 million and operating profit of approximately $ 11 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The following unaudited supplemental pro-forma data presents consolidated information as if the acquisition had been completed on January 1, 2017. The pro-forma results were calculated by combining the results of RTC with the stand-alone results of Rockwell Collins for the pre-acquisition periods, which were adjusted to account for certain costs that would have been incurred during this pre-acquisition period: (dollars in millions, except per share amounts; shares in millions) 2018 Net sales $ 42,336 Net income attributable to common shareowners from continuing operations 2,011 Basic earnings per share of common stock from continuing operations $ 2.26 Diluted earnings per share of common stock from continuing operations 2.24 The unaudited supplemental pro-forma data above includes the following significant adjustments made to account for certain costs which would have been incurred if the acquisition had been completed on January 1, 2017, as adjusted for the applicable 90 Table of C ontents tax impact. As our acquisition of Rockwell Collins was completed on November 26, 2018, the pro-forma adjustments in the table below only include the required adjustments through November 26, 2018: (dollars in millions) 2018 Amortization of inventory and fixed asset fair value adjustment (1) $ 58 Amortization of acquired Rockwell Collins intangible assets, net (2) ( 193 ) Utilization of contractual customer obligation (3) 16 RTC/Rockwell fees for advisory, legal, accounting services (4) 212 Interest expense incurred on acquisition financing, net (5) ( 199 ) Elimination of capitalized pre-production engineering amortization (6) 63 Adjustment to net periodic pension cost (7) 42 Adjustment to reflect the adoption of ASC 606 (8) 106 Elimination of entities held for sale (9) ( 47 ) $ 58 (1) Reflects the elimination of the inventory step-up amortization recorded by RTC in 2018 as this would have been completed within the first two quarters of 2017. Additionally, this adjustment reflects the amortization of the fixed asset fair value adjustment as of the acquisition date. (2) Reflects the additional amortization of the acquired Rockwell Collins’ intangible assets recognized at fair value in purchase accounting and eliminates the historical Rockwell Collins intangible asset amortization expense. (3) Reflects the additional amortization of liabilities recognized for acquired contracts with terms less favorable than could be realized in market transactions as of the acquisition date and eliminates Rockwell Collins historical amortization of these liabilities. (4) Reflects the elimination of transaction-related fees incurred by RTC and Rockwell Collins in connection with the acquisition and assumes all of the fees were incurred during the first quarter of 2017. (5) Reflects the additional interest expense incurred on debt to finance our acquisition of Rockwell Collins and reduces interest expense for the debt fair value adjustment which would have been amortized. (6) Reflects the elimination of Rockwell Collins capitalized pre-production engineering amortization to conform to RTC policy. (7) Reflects adjustments for the elimination of amortization of prior service cost and actuarial loss amortization, which was recorded by Rockwell Collins, as a result of fair value purchase accounting, net of the impact of the revised pension and post-retirement benefit (expense) as determined under RTC’s plan assumptions. (8) Reflects adjustments to Rockwell Collins revenue recognition as if they adopted the New Revenue Standard as of January 1, 2018 and primarily relates to capitalization of contract costs and changes in timing of sales recognition for contracts requiring an over time method of revenue recognition, partially offset by deferral of revenue recognized on OEM product engineering and development. (9) Reflects the elimination of entities required to be sold for regulatory approvals. The unaudited supplemental pro-forma financial information does not reflect the potential realization of cost savings related to the integration of the two companies. Further, the pro-forma data should not be considered indicative of the results that would have occurred if the acquisition and related financing had been consummated on January 1, 2017, nor are they indicative of future results. Dispositions. In 2020, 2019 and 2018 cash inflows related to dispositions during w ere $ 2,556 million, $ 134 million, and $ 74 million, respectively. As discussed further in “Note 3: Discontinued Operations,” on April 2, 2020, Carrier and Otis entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement with UTC (since renamed Raytheon Technologies Corporation), pursuant to which, among other things, UTC agreed to separate into three independent, publicly traded companies – UTC, Carrier and Otis and distribute all of the outstanding common stock of Carrier and Otis to UTC shareowners who held shares of UTC common stock as of the close of business on March 19, 2020. UTC distributed 866,158,910 and 433,079,455 shares of common stock of Carrier and Otis, respectively in the Distributions. As a result of the Distributions, Carrier and Otis are now independent publicly traded companies. In May 2020, in order to meet the requirements for regulatory approval of the Raytheon Merger, we completed the sale of our airborne tactical radios business for $ 231 million in cash, net of transaction-related costs. The business was part of our RIS segment. As the transaction occurred subsequent to the Raytheon Merger, the gain of $ 199 million was not recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Operations, but rather was recorded as part of the fair value of net assets acquired in the preliminary allocation of consideration transferred to net assets acquired in the Raytheon Merger, as discussed further above. Income before taxes related to the disposed business for the period from the closing of the Raytheon Merger to disposal date was not material. In the third quarter of 2020, in accordance with conditions imposed for regulatory approval of the Raytheon Merger, we completed the sale of our Collins Aerospace military Global Positioning System (GPS) and space-based precision optics businesses for $ 2.3 billion in cash, resulting in an aggregate pre-tax gain, net of transaction costs, of $ 564 million ($ 240 million after tax), of which $ 595 million was included in Other income, net partially offset by $ 23 million of aggregate transaction costs included in Selling, general and administrative costs and an $ 8 million expense included in Non-service pension (income) 91 Table of C ontents expense within our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Income before taxes for 2020, through the date of sale, and for full year 2019 for these businesses were $ 94 million and $ 153 million, respectively. In October 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Forcepoint business, which we completed in January 2021, for $ 1.1 billion in cash. At December 31, 2020, the related assets of approximately $ 1.9 billion and liabilities of approximately $ 855 million have been accounted for as held for sale at fair value less cost to sell; however, Forcepoint does not qualify for presentation as discontinued operations. These held for sale assets and liabilities are presented in Other assets, current and Other accrued liabilities, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Assets held for sale included $ 1.4 billion of goodwill and intangible assets. A further breakout of major classes of assets and liabilities has not been provided as the assets and liabilities held for sale are not material. We do not expect to recognize a pre-tax gain or loss within the Consolidated Statement of Operations related to the sale of Forcepoint, as any difference between the fair value, as determined by the purchase price, and the book value of the net assets has been recorded as part of the fair value of the net assets acquired in the preliminary allocation of consideration transferred to net assets acquired in the Raytheon Merger. The results of Forcepoint are included in Eliminations and other in our segment results. Goodwill. Changes in our goodwill balances for the year ended in 2020 were as follows: (dollars in millions) Balance as of January 1, 2020 Acquisitions and Divestitures Impairment Losses Foreign currency translation and other Balance as of December 31, 2020 Collins Aerospace Systems $ 35,025 $ ( 890 ) $ ( 3,183 ) $ 619 $ 31,571 Pratt & Whitney 1,563 — — — 1,563 Raytheon Intelligence & Space — 9,236 — 4 9,240 Raytheon Missiles & Defense — 11,887 — 3 11,890 Total Segment 36,588 20,233 ( 3,183 ) 626 54,264 Eliminations and other 21 — — — 21 Total $ 36,609 $ 20,233 $ ( 3,183 ) $ 626 $ 54,285 The Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired. We considered the deterioration in general economic and market conditions primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic to be a triggering event in the first and second quarters of 2020, requiring an impairment evaluation of goodwill, intangible assets and other assets in our commercial aerospace businesses, Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney. Beginning in the second quarter of 2020, we observed several airline customer bankruptcies, delays and cancellations of aircraft purchases by airlines, fleet retirements and repositioning of OEM production schedules and we experienced a significant decline in revenues at our Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney businesses due to a decline in flight hours, aircraft fleet utilization, shop visits and commercial OEM deliveries. These factors contributed to a deterioration of our expectations regarding the timing of a return to pre-COVID-19 commercial flight activity, which further reduced our future sales and cash flows expectations. In the second quarter of 2020, we evaluated the Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney reporting units for goodwill impairment and determined that the carrying values of two of the six Collins Aerospace reporting units exceeded the sum of discounted future cash flows, resulting in goodwill impairments of $ 3.2 billion. Collins Aerospace discounted future cash flow estimates were developed for three scenarios: a base case, a downside case, and an upside case. These scenarios included assumptions regarding future airline flight activity, out of warranty hours on original equipment, expected repairs, upgrades and replacements, future OEM manufacturing schedules and related environmental assumptions, including individuals’ desire to return to normal travel, business needs to travel, and potential cures or vaccines to prevent or reduce the effects of COVID-19. These estimates require a significant amount of judgment and are subject to change based upon factors outside our control. We weighted the three scenarios as follows: 50% for the base case, 40% for the downside case, and 10% for the upside case, and used these weightings, as we believed they reflected the risks and opportunities relative to our estimates. Goodwill impairment was not indicated for any of the other reporting units evaluated for impairment in any of these scenarios. We did not identify any further deterioration to our expectations in the third quarter of 2020, and therefore, did not have a triggering event. 92 Table of C ontents On October 1, 2020, we changed our annual goodwill impairment testing date from July 1 to October 1 to better align with the timing of our annual long-term planning process. Accordingly, management determined that the change in accounting principle is preferable under the circumstance. This change has been applied prospectively from October 1, 2020 as retrospective application would not change the Company’s accounting for goodwill. This change was not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements as it did not delay, accelerate, or avoid any potential goodwill impairment charges. We completed our annual impairment testing as of October 1, 2020, where we assessed our Pratt & Whitney, RIS, RMD and one of the Collins Aerospace reporting units using qualitative factors to determine whether it was more likely than not that any individual reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value (step 0) and determined that no further testing was required based on there being no significant changes at RIS and RMD since the acquisition of Raytheon Company and the substantial cushion of fair value over book value at the other reporting units. For the remainder of our Collins Aerospace reporting units, we compared the fair value of the reporting units to their respective carrying values (step 1), and determined that no additional adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill were necessary. Based on our annual impairment analysis as of October 1, 2020, the reporting unit that was closest to impairment was a reporting unit at Collins Aerospace with a fair value in excess of book value, including goodwill, of $ 1.2 billion or 7 %. Impairment evaluations at Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney resulted in several other non-goodwill related impairment charges as further discussed in “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles.” These charges were primarily due to declines in expected future commercial air traffic, airline bankruptcies, or other impacts such as accelerated fleet retirements, announced program delays and expected changes to contract terms. The Company continuously monitors for events and circumstances that could negatively impact the key assumptions in determining the fair value of goodwill, including long-term revenue growth projections, profitability, discount rates, recent market valuations from transactions by comparable companies, volatility in the Company’s market capitalization, and general industry, market and macro-economic conditions. It is possible that future changes in such circumstances, including a more prolonged and/or severe COVID-19 pandemic than originally anticipated, or future changes in the variables associated with the judgments, assumptions and estimates used in assessing the fair value of our reporting units, including the expected long term recovery of airline travel to pre-COVID-19 levels, would require the Company to record a non-cash impairment charge. Intangible Assets. Identifiable intangible assets are comprised of the following: 2020 2019 (dollars in millions) Gross Amount Accumulated Amortization Gross Amount Accumulated Amortization Amortized: Patents and trademarks $ 48 $ ( 35 ) $ 47 $ ( 34 ) Collaboration intangible assets 5,021 ( 1,024 ) 4,862 ( 920 ) Exclusivity assets 2,541 ( 295 ) 2,386 ( 275 ) Developed technology and other 906 ( 316 ) 890 ( 217 ) Customer relationships 30,241 ( 5,262 ) 17,750 ( 3,392 ) 38,757 ( 6,932 ) 25,935 ( 4,838 ) Unamortized: Trademarks and other 8,714 — 3,376 — Total $ 47,471 $ ( 6,932 ) $ 29,311 $ ( 4,838 ) Given the deterioration in general economic and market conditions primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we performed an assessment of our unamortized intangible assets and recorded $ 57 million in 2020 related to the impairment of an indefinite-lived tradename intangible assets at Collins Aerospace. At December 31, 2020, the intangible asset that was closest to impairment was a tradename at Collins Aerospace with a fair value in excess of book value of approximately $ 110 million, or 7 %. We also evaluated amortizable intangible assets and identified no impairments. We will continue to evaluate the impact on our customers and our business in future periods which may result in a different conclusion. Amortization of intangible assets was $ 2,125 million, $ 1,244 million and $ 736 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The following is the expected amortization of total intangible assets for 2021 through 2025, which reflects the pattern of expected economic benefit on certain aerospace intangible assets: (dollars in millions) 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 Amortization expense $ 2,409 $ 1,924 $ 2,040 $ 2,106 $ 2,020 93 Table of C ontents NOTE 3: DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS As discussed above, on April 2, 2020, Carrier and Otis entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement with UTC (since renamed Raytheon Technologies Corporation), pursuant to which, among other things, UTC agreed to separate into three independent, publicly traded companies – UTC, Carrier and Otis and distribute all of the outstanding common stock of Carrier and Otis to UTC shareowners who held shares of U TC common stock as of the close of business on March 19, 2020. The Separation Transactions were completed on April 3, 2020. In 2020, a total of $ 1,329 million of costs have been incurred related to the Separation Transactions and recorded in the following financial statement line items: $ 974 million in Income from discontinued operations, $ 86 million of benefit in Income tax expense from discontinued operations, $ 23 million in Income from continuing operations and $ 418 million in Income tax expense. Carrier and Otis are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented.

Net cash used in financing activities primarily consists of net cash transfers from Carrier and Otis to RTC. The Separation of Carrier was treated as a return on capital and recorded as a reduction to retained earnings, as it was in a net asset position, while the Separation of Otis was treated as a return of capital and recorded as an adjustment to Common stock, as it was in a net liability position. The remaining assets and liabilities related to discontinued operations at December 31, 2020 primarily relate to trailing tax assets and liabilities of the Company related to the Separation Transactions, including indemnification obligations. The major components of assets and liabilities related to discontinued operations at December 31, 2019 are provided below: (dollars in millions) Otis Carrier Total Assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,446 $ 995 $ 2,441 Accounts receivable, net 2,899 2,728 5,627 Contract assets, current 530 679 1,209 Inventories and contracts in progress, net 571 1,332 1,903 Other assets, current 213 221 434 Fixed assets, net 747 1,686 2,433 Operating lease right-of-use assets 529 818 1,347 Goodwill 1,647 9,807 11,454 Intangible assets, net 490 1,083 1,573 Other assets 575 2,827 3,402 Total assets related to discontinued operations $ 9,647 $ 22,176 $ 31,823 Liabilities and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest Short-term borrowings $ 33 $ 38 $ 71 Accounts payable 1,321 1,682 3,003 Accrued employee compensation 516 506 1,022 Other accrued liabilities 1,135 2,383 3,518 Contract liabilities, current 2,288 611 2,899 Long-term debt, currently due 1 237 238 Long-term debt 5 82 87 Future pension and postretirement benefit obligations 560 455 1,015 Operating lease liabilities 383 668 1,051 Other long-term liabilities (1) 514 1,025 1,539 Total liabilities related to discontinued operations $ 6,756 $ 7,687 $ 14,443 96 Table of C ontents NOTE 4: EARNINGS PER SHARE (dollars in millions, except per share amounts; shares in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Net income (loss) attributable to common shareowners: Income (loss) from continuing operations $ ( 3,109 ) $ 3,510 $ 1,216 Income (loss) from discontinued operations ( 410 ) 2,027 4,053 Net income (loss) attributable to common shareowners $ ( 3,519 ) $ 5,537 $ 5,269 Basic weighted average number of shares outstanding 1,357.8 854.8 800.4 Stock awards and equity units (share equivalent) — 9.1 9.7 Diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding 1,357.8 863.9 810.1 Earnings (Loss) per share attributable to common shareowners - basic Income (loss) from continuing operations $ ( 2.29 ) $ 4.11 $ 1.52 Income (loss) from discontinued operations ( 0.30 ) 2.37 5.06 Net income (loss) attributable to common shareowners $ ( 2.59 ) $ 6.48 $ 6.58 Earnings (Loss) per share attributable to common shareowners - diluted Income (loss) from continuing operations $ ( 2.29 ) $ 4.06 $ 1.50 Income (loss) from discontinued operations ( 0.30 ) 2.35 5.00 Net income (loss) attributable to common shareowners $ ( 2.59 ) $ 6.41 $ 6.50 It may not be possible to recalculate earnings per share (EPS) attributable to common shareowners by adjusting EPS from continuing operations by EPS from discontinued operations as each amount is calculated independently. The computation of diluted EPS excludes the effect of the potential exercise of stock awards, including stock appreciation rights and stock options, when the average market price of the common stock is lower than the exercise price of the related stock awards during the period because the effect would be anti-dilutive. In addition, the computation of diluted EPS excludes the effect of the potential exercise of stock awards when the awards’ assumed proceeds exceed the average market price of the common shares during the period. For 2020, 2019 and 2018, there were 32.5 million, 8.3 million and 5.1 million anti-dilutive stock awards excluded from the computation, respectively. All outstanding stock awards are excluded in the computation of diluted EPS in 2020 because their effect was antidilutive due to the loss from continuing operations. NOTE 5: ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET Accounts receivable, net consisted of the following: (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 U.S. government contracts (including foreign military sales) $ 1,039 $ 551 Other customers 8,761 8,446 Allowance for expected credit losses ( 546 ) ( 254 ) Total accounts receivable, net $ 9,254 $ 8,743 The Company enters into various factoring agreements with third-party financial institutions to sell certain of its receivables. Under these arrangements, the Company factored receivables of $ 6.4 billion and $ 7.8 billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The cash received from these arrangements is reflected as cash provided by operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. In certain of these factoring arrangements, for ease of administration, the Company will collect customer payments related to the factored receivables, which it then remits to the financial institutions. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had $ 10 million and $ 7 million, respectively, that was collected on behalf of the financial institutions and recorded as restricted cash and accrued liabilities. The net cash flows relating to these collections are reported as financing activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. 97 Table of C ontents The changes in the allowance for expected credit losses related to Accounts receivable were as follows: (dollars in millions) 2020 Balance as of December 31, 2019 $ 254 Current period provision for expected credit losses (1) 277 Write-offs charged against the allowance for expected credit losses ( 5 ) Other, net (2) 20 Balance as of December 31, 2020 $ 546 (1) The current provision for expected credit losses for 2020 includes $ 248 million of reserves driven by customer bankruptcies and additional reserves for credit losses primarily due to the current economic environment primarily caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. (2) Other includes $ 34 million of impact related to the January 1, 2020 adoption of ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was not material in 2019 or 2018. NOTE 6: CONTRACT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES Contract assets reflect revenue recognized and performance obligations satisfied in advance of customer billing. Contract liabilities relate to payments received in advance of the satisfaction of performance under the contract. We receive payments from customers based on the terms established in our contracts. Total contract assets and contract liabilities as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows: (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 Contract assets $ 9,931 $ 4,462 Contract liabilities ( 12,889 ) ( 9,014 ) Net contract liabilities $ ( 2,958 ) $ ( 4,552 ) Contract assets increased $ 5,469 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to the Raytheon Merger, which accounted for an increase of $ 5.5 billion, net of $ 335 million of contract asset write-offs or reclassifications related to certain precision guided munitions contracts with certain Middle Eastern customers as described below. Included in the change in contract assets was a decrease of $ 132 million due to the impairments and incremental credit loss reserves related to our commercial aerospace businesses, as discussed below. Contract liabilities increased $ 3,875 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to the Raytheon Merger, which accounted for an increase of $ 3.8 billion. We have direct commercial sales contracts for precision guided munitions with a certain Middle East customer, for which we have not yet obtained regulatory approval. Due to the result of the U.S. presidential and congressional election, and the resulting uncertainty surrounding U.S. foreign policy on direct commercial sales for precision guided munitions with this customer, we determined that it is no longer probable that we will be able to obtain required regulatory approvals for these contracts; however, this determination could change as the U.S. government’s foreign policy views are clarified. Therefore, in the fourth quarter of 2020, we reversed $ 119 million of sales for work performed on these specific contracts subsequent to the date of the Raytheon Merger and through the end of the third quarter of 2020, and the related operating profit. In addition, we recognized an unfavorable profit impact of $ 516 million, primarily related to inventory reserves, contract asset impairments and recognition of supplier related obligations related to termination liability, which we now do not expect to be utilized or otherwise directed to other customers. In addition, we reversed $ 755 million of backlog on these contracts. As of December 31, 2020, our contract liabilities include $ 405 million of advance payments received from the customer on these contracts, which may become refundable to the customer if the contracts are ultimately terminated. Contract assets consisted of the following at December 31: (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 Unbilled $ 20,336 $ 5,211 Progress payments ( 10,405 ) ( 749 ) Total contract assets $ 9,931 $ 4,462 The U.S. government has title to the assets related to unbilled amounts on U.S. government contracts that provide progress payments. Contract assets include retentions arising from contractual provisions. At December 31, 2020, retentions were $ 98 million. Total contract assets include an allowance for credit losses of $ 177 million as of December 31, 2020. For additional information 98 Table of C ontents on the adoption of the Credit Loss Standard on January 1, 2020, see “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles.” The increase in the allowance for 2020 includes incremental credit loss reserves of $ 132 million related to a number of airline customers that have filed for bankruptcy and additional reserves due to the current economic environment primarily caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, in 2020, we recognized an impairment of $ 111 million of contract assets at Collins Aerospace due to the impact of lower estimated future customer activity principally driven by the expected acceleration of fleet retirements of a commercial aircraft, and we recognized an impairment of $ 129 million of contract assets as a result of an unfavorable EAC adjustment related to lower estimated revenues due to the restructuring of a customer contract at Pratt & Whitney. In 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recognized revenue of $ 2,763 million, $ 2,850 million and $ 2,269 million related to our contract liabilities at January 1, 2020, January 1, 2019 and January 1, 2018, respectively. NOTE 7: INVENTORY, NET (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 Raw materials $ 3,015 $ 2,984 Work-in-process 2,924 2,586 Finished goods 3,472 3,477 $ 9,411 $ 9,047 Raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods are net of valuation reserves of $ 1,788 million and $ 1,122 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. NOTE 8: COMMERCIAL AEROSPACE INDUSTRY ASSETS AND COMMITMENTS The COVID-19 pandemic’s continued disruption to air travel and commercial activities and the significant restrictions and limitations on businesses within the aerospace and commercial airline industries have negatively impacted global supply, demand and distribution capabilities. In particular, the significant decrease in air travel resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting our airline and airframer customers, and their demand for the products and services of our Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney businesses. As described in “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles,” in 2020, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $ 3.2 billion at our Collins Aerospace business, as well as write-downs of assets in both our Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney businesses primarily related to increased estimated credit losses, impairments of contract assets due lower estimated future customer activity or revenues on commercial contracts, impairment of commercial aircraft program assets and the impairment of a Collins Aerospace trade name. We continue to monitor the recoverability of our commercial aerospace industry assets and assess potential exposures. The following summarizes certain significant assets and off-balance sheet exposures specifically related to our commercial aerospace customers: (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 Assets related to commercial aerospace industry customers: Accounts receivable, net (Note 5) $ 7,239 $ 7,560 Contract assets (Note 6) 2,559 2,741 Customer financing assets (1) (Note 1) 3,160 3,476 Contract fulfillment costs (Note 1) 1,773 1,361 Guarantees and Commitments related to commercial aerospace industry customers: Commercial aerospace guarantees (net of reserves and collaboration partners’ share) (Note 18) 174 184 Commercial aerospace commitments (net of collaboration partners’ share) (Note 19) 8,515 9,708 (1) Customer financing assets is inclusive of both the current and long term balances. We also have goodwill and intangible assets, including exclusivity assets and collaboration assets, associated with our commercial aerospace business. Refer to “Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets” for further discussion. NOTE 9: FIXED ASSETS, NET Fixed assets, net, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Major improvements are capitalized while expenditures for maintenance, repairs and minor improvements are expensed. For sales or asset retirements, the assets and related accumulated 99 Table of C ontents depreciation and amortization are eliminated from the accounts. Gains and losses on sales of our fixed assets, net, are generally recorded in operating income; however, for our RIS and RMD segments, gains and losses that are allocable to our contracts are included in overhead, as we are required to allocate gains or losses and generally can recover these costs through the pricing of products and services to the U.S. government. (dollars in millions) Estimated Useful Lives 2020 2019 Land $ 773 $ 292 Buildings and improvements 12 - 45 years 7,067 4,978 Machinery, tools and equipment 3 - 20 years 15,994 12,936 Other, including assets under construction 2,512 1,871 26,346 20,077 Accumulated depreciation ( 11,384 ) ( 9,755 ) $ 14,962 $ 10,322 Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life of the improvement. Depreciation expense related to fixed assets, net is recorded predominantly utilizing the straight-line method and was $ 1,767 million in 2020, $ 1,191 million in 2019 and $ 945 million in 2018. NOTE 10: BORROWINGS AND LINES OF CREDIT (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 Commercial paper $ 160 $ — Other borrowings 87 2,293 Total short-term borrowings $ 247 $ 2,293 As of December 31, 2020, our maximum commercial paper borrowing limit was $ 5.0 billion as the commercial paper is backed by our $ 5.0 billion revolving credit agreement. We use our commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes, including the funding of potential acquisitions, pension contributions, debt refinancing, dividend payments and repurchases of our common stock. The commercial paper notes outstanding have original maturities of not more than 90 days from the date of issuance. In preparation for and in anticipation of the Separation Transactions, the Distributions and the Raytheon Merger, the Company entered into and terminated a number of credit agreements. On February 11, 2020 and March 3, 2020, we terminated a $ 2.0 billion revolving credit agreement and a $ 4.0 billion term loan credit agreement, respectively. Upon termination, we repaid the $ 2.1 billion of borrowings outstanding on the $ 4.0 billion term loan credit agreement. On April 3, 2020, upon the completion of the Raytheon Merger, we terminated a $ 2.20 billion revolving credit agreement and a $ 2.15 billion multicurrency revolving credit agreement. On March 20, 2020 and March 23, 2020, we entered into two $ 500 million term loan credit agreements and borrowed $ 1.0 billion under these agreements in the first quarter of 2020. We terminated these agreements on May 5, 2020 and April 28, 2020, respectively, upon repayment. On March 16, 2020, we entered into a revolving credit agreement with various banks permitting aggregate borrowings of up to $ 5.0 billion which became available upon completion of the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020. This credit agreement matures on April 3, 2025. On May 6, 2020, we entered into a revolving credit agreement with various banks permitting aggregate borrowings of up to $ 2.0 billion. This credit agreement matures on May 5, 2021. As of December 31, 2020, we had revolving credit agreements with various banks permitting aggregate borrowings of up to $ 7.0 billion, and there were no borrowings outstanding under these agreements. In preparation for and in anticipation of the Separation Transactions and Distributions, the Company, Carrier and Otis issued and the Company repaid long-term debt during the year ended December 31, 2020, which are shown in the tables below. On February 10, 2020, Otis entered into a term loan credit agreement providing for a $ 1.0 billion unsecured, unsubordinated 3-year term loan credit facility. Also on February 10, 2020, Carrier entered into a term loan credit agreement providing for a $ 1.75 billion unsecured, unsubordinated 3-year term loan credit facility. On March 27, 2020, Carrier and Otis drew on the full amounts of the term loans and distributed the full proceeds to Raytheon Technologies in connection with the Separation 100 Table of C ontents Transactions. UTC utilized those amounts to extinguish Raytheon Technologies’ short-term and long-term debt in order to not exceed the maximum applicable net indebtedness required by the Raytheon Merger Agreement. At December 31, 2020, approximately $ 1 billion was available under short-term lines of credit with local banks at our various domestic and international subsidiaries. The weighted-average interest expense rates applicable to short-term borrowings and total debt were as follows: 2020 2019 Average interest expense rate - average outstanding borrowings during the year: Short-term borrowings 2.0 % 1.7 % Total debt 4.0 % 3.6 % Average interest expense rate - outstanding borrowings as of December 31: Short-term borrowings 0.6 % 2.3 % Total debt 4.2 % 3.6 % We had the following issuances of long-term debt during 2020, which is inclusive of issuances made by Carrier and Otis which were primarily used by the Company to extinguish certain Raytheon Technologies short-term and long-term debt and, therefore, were treated as a distribution from discontinued operations within financing activities from continuing operation on our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows: Issuance Date Description of Notes Aggregate Principal Balance (in millions) May 18, 2020 2.250 % notes due 2030 $ 1,000 3.125 % notes due 2050 1,000 March 27, 2020 Term Loan due 2023 (Otis) (1) 1,000 Term Loan due 2023 (Carrier) (1) 1,750 February 27, 2020 1.923 % notes due 2023 (1) 500 LIBOR plus 0.450 % floating rate notes due 2023 (1) 500 2.056 % notes due 2025 (1) 1,300 2.242 % notes due 2025 (1) 2,000 2.293 % notes due 2027 (1) 500 2.493 % notes due 2027 (1) 1,250 2.565 % notes due 2030 (1) 1,500 2.722 % notes due 2030 (1) 2,000 3.112 % notes due 2040 (1) 750 3.377 % notes due 2040 (1) 1,500 3.362 % notes due 2050 (1) 750 3.577 % notes due 2050 (1) 2,000 (1) The debt issuances and term loan draws reflect debt incurred by Carrier and Otis. The net proceeds of these issuances were primarily utilized to extinguish Raytheon Technologies short-term and long-term debt in order to not exceed the maximum applicable net indebtedness required by the Raytheon Merger Agreement. We had no issuances of long-term debt during 2019. 101 Table of C ontents We made the following repayments of debt during 2020 and 2019: Repayment Date Description of Notes Aggregate Principal Balance (in millions) October 15, 2020 3.125 % notes due 2020 (1) $ 1,000 May 19, 2020 3.650 % notes due 2023 (2)(3) $ 410 May 15, 2020 EURIBOR plus 0.20 % floating rate notes due 2020 (€ 750 million principal value) (3) $ 817 March 29, 2020 4.500 % notes due 2020 (2)(3) $ 1,250 1.125 % notes due 2021 (€ 950 million principal value) (2)(3) $ 1,082 1.250 % notes due 2023 (€ 750 million principal value) (2)(3) $ 836 1.150 % notes due 2024 (€ 750 million principal value) (2)(3) $ 841 1.875 % notes due 2026 (€ 500 million principal value) (2)(3) $ 567 March 3, 2020 1.900 % notes due 2020 (2)(3) $ 1,000 3.350 % notes due 2021 (2)(3) $ 1,000 LIBOR plus 0.650 % floating rate notes due 2021 (2)(3) $ 750 1.950 % notes due 2021 (2)(3) $ 750 2.300 % notes due 2022 (2)(3) $ 500 3.100 % notes due 2022 (2)(3) $ 2,300 2.800 % notes due 2024 (2)(3) $ 800 March 2, 2020 4.875 % notes due 2020 (2)(3) $ 171 February 28, 2020 3.650 % notes due 2023 (2)(3) $ 1,669 2.650 % notes due 2026 (2)(3) $ 431 November 15, 2019 8.875 % notes due 2019 $ 271 November 13, 2019 EURIBOR plus 0.15 % floating rate notes due 2019 € 750 November 1, 2019 LIBOR plus 0.350 % floating rate notes due 2019 $ 350 1.500 % notes due 2019 $ 650 July 15, 2019 1.950 % notes due 2019 (4) $ 300 5.250 % notes due 2019 (4) $ 300 (1) These notes were assumed in connection with the Raytheon Merger and subsequently repaid. (2) In connection with the early repayment of outstanding principal, Raytheon Technologies recorded debt extinguishment costs of $ 703 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which are classified as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Statement of Operations as we would not have had to redeem the debt, except for the Separation Transactions. No proceeds of the notes issued May 18, 2020 were used to fund the May 19, 2020 redemption. (3) Extinguishment of Raytheon Technologies short-term and long-term debt in order to not exceed the maximum net indebtedness required by the Raytheon Merger Agreement. (4) These notes were assumed in connection with the Rockwell Collins Acquisition and subsequently repaid. On June 10, 2020, we completed an exchange offer with eligible holders of the outstanding notes of Goodrich Corporation maturing through 2046, Raytheon Company maturing through 2044 and Rockwell Collins Inc. maturing through 2047 (collectively, the “Subsidiary Notes”). An aggregate principal amount of approximately $ 8.2 billion of the Subsidiary Notes was exchanged for approximately $ 8.2 billion of Raytheon Technologies notes with identical interest rates, maturity dates, and redemption provisions, if any, as the Subsidiary Notes exchanged. Because the exchange was for substantially identical notes, the change was treated as a debt modification for accounting purposes with no gain or loss recognized.

The percentage of total short-term borrowings and long-term debt at variable interest rates was approximately 1 % and 9 % at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Interest rates on our commercial paper borrowings are considered variable due to their short-term duration and high-frequency of turnover. The average maturity of our long-term debt at December 31, 2020 is approximately 14 years. The schedule of principal payments required on long-term debt for the next five years and thereafter is: (in millions) 2021 $ 550 2022 2,224 2023 581 2024 1,262 2025 1,582 Thereafter 25,271 Total $ 31,470 NOTE 11: EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS We sponsor various domestic and foreign employee benefit plans, which are discussed below. Employee Savings Plans. We sponsor various employee savings plans. Our contributions to employer sponsored defined contribution plans were $ 875 million, $ 485 million and $ 332 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our non-union domestic employee savings plan for legacy UTC employees uses an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) for employer matching contributions. External borrowings were used by the ESOP to fund a portion of its purchase of ESOP stock from us. The external borrowings have been extinguished and only re-amortized loans remain between RTC and the ESOP Trust. As ESOP debt service payments are made, common stock is released from an unreleased shares account. ESOP debt may be prepaid or re-amortized to either increase or decrease the number of shares released so that the value of released shares equals the value of plan benefit. We may also, at our option, contribute additional common stock or cash to the ESOP. Shares of common stock are allocated to employees’ ESOP accounts at fair value on the date earned. Cash dividends on common stock held by the ESOP are used for debt service payments. Participants may choose to have their ESOP dividends reinvested or distributed in cash. Common stock allocated to ESOP participants is included in the average number of common shares outstanding for both basic and diluted EPS. At December 31, 2020, 23.4 million common shares had been allocated to employees, leaving 9.4 million unallocated common shares in the ESOP Trust, with a fair value of $ 672 million. Pension and Postretirement Plans. We sponsor both funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension plans that cover a large number of our employees. Our largest plans are generally closed to new participants. We also sponsor both funded and unfunded PRB plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits to eligible retirees. Our plans use a December 31 measurement date consistent with our fiscal year. The Separation Transactions included the transfer of certain defined benefit plans from UTC to Carrier and Otis. The plans transferred were primarily international plans with the majority of the UTC defined benefit liability remaining with Raytheon Technologies. Upon separation, the employees within Carrier and Otis were effectively terminated from Raytheon Technologies. The terminations of approximately 3,400 domestic pension plan participants triggered a mid-year remeasurement of the UTC domestic plans. The remeasurement, which was calculated using discount rates and asset values as of April 3, 2020 (using March 31, 2020 as a practical expedient), resulted in a $ 2.4 billion increase to our pension liability, primarily due to a decrease in the fair market value of the plans’ assets since December 31, 2019. All service cost previously associated with Carrier and Otis is included in discontinued operations. For non-service pension (income) expense and the pension liability, generally only the portion related to the defined benefit plans transferred to Carrier and Otis as part of the Separation Transactions has been reclassified to discontinued operations. 104 Table of C ontents Raytheon Company has both funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and PRB plans. As of the merger date, the Raytheon Company plans were remeasured at fair value using accounting policies consistent with the UTC plans. Refer to “Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets” for additional information. The deferred pension and PRB plan losses included in Raytheon Company’s accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of the merger date were eliminated and are no longer subject to amortization in net periodic benefit (income) expense. Amounts prior to the merger date of April 3, 2020, do not include the Raytheon Company pension plan results. In September 2019, we amended the UTC domestic defined benefit pension plans to cease accrual of additional benefits for future service and compensation for non-union participants effective December 31, 2019. Beginning January 1, 2020, these participants began receiving additional contributions under the UTC domestic defined contribution plan. The plan change did not impact participants’ historical benefit accruals. We utilized the practical expedient and remeasured plan assets and pension benefit obligations for the affected pension plans as of the nearest month-end, August 31, 2019, resulting in a net actuarial loss of $ 425 million. This reflects remeasurement losses of $ 605 million, partially offset by a benefit obligation gain of $ 180 million resulting from the benefit plan change. The remeasurement losses are driven by a reduction of 124 basis points in the PBO discount rate as of the remeasurement date compared to December 31, 2018, partially offset by actual asset returns of approximately 17 % as of the remeasurement date. We recorded a curtailment gain of $ 98 million in the Consolidated Statement of Operations, due to the recognition of previously unrecognized prior service credits for the affected pension plans. For non-union employees in the UTC domestic pension plans, benefits for service up to December 31, 2014 are generally based on the employee’s years of service and compensation. Benefits for service after December 31, 2014 and through December 31, 2019 are based on the existing cash balance formula that was adopted in 2003 for newly hired non-union employees and for non-union employees who made a one-time voluntary election to have future benefit accruals determined under this formula. Benefits for union employees in the UTC domestic pension plans are generally based on a stated amount for each year of service. In December 2020, we approved a change to the Raytheon domestic benefit pension plans for non-union participants to cease future benefit accruals based on an employee’s years of service and compensation effective December 31, 2022. The plan change does not impact participants’ historical benefit accruals. Benefits for service after December 31, 2022 will be based on a cash balance formula. We utilized a practical expedient and measured the plan assets and pension benefit obligations for the effected pension plans as of the nearest month end, December 31, 2020, resulting in a current year prior service credit of $ 2.1 billion. We made the following contributions to our pension and PRB plans’ trusts during the years ended December 31: (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 U.S. qualified defined benefit plans $ 885 $ 25 $ — International defined benefit plans 125 30 79 PRB plans 15 — — The contributions to our U.S. qualified defined benefit plans for the year ended December 31, 2020 include a $ 750 million discretionary contribution to the Raytheon Company U.S. qualified pension plans’ trust. As a result of this discretionary contribution, we do not expect to make any required contributions to our U.S. qualified plans’ trust until 2022. The contributions to our International defined benefit plans for the year ended December 31, 2020 include a $ 51 million discretionary contribution. We expect to make total contributions of approximately $ 50 million to our international defined benefit plans’ trusts in 2021, which are expected to meet or exceed the current funding requirements. 105 Table of C ontents Pension PRB (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2020 2019 Change in Benefit Obligation: Beginning balance $ 38,027 $ 34,344 $ 765 $ 810 Service cost attributable to continuing operations 483 261 6 2 Service cost attributable to discontinued operations 1 34 — — Interest cost 1,650 1,245 37 31 Actuarial loss (gain) 7,029 4,247 114 ( 11 ) Total benefits paid (1) ( 3,623 ) ( 2,016 ) ( 144 ) ( 69 ) Net settlement, curtailment and special termination benefits ( 4 ) ( 206 ) ( 8 ) — Plan amendments ( 2,088 ) — ( 7 ) — Business combinations and divestitures (2) 29,385 ( 6 ) 724 — Other (3) 397 124 48 2 Ending balance $ 71,257 $ 38,027 $ 1,535 $ 765 Change in Plan Assets: Beginning balance $ 36,225 $ 32,150 $ 20 $ 20 Actual return on plan assets 9,885 5,873 80 — Employer contributions (1) 1,201 137 102 69 Total benefits paid (1) ( 3,623 ) ( 2,016 ) ( 144 ) ( 69 ) Settlements ( 32 ) ( 17 ) ( 8 ) — Business combinations and divestitures (2) 18,310 ( 10 ) 286 — Other (3) 352 108 45 — Ending balance $ 62,318 $ 36,225 $ 381 $ 20 Funded Status: Fair value of plan assets $ 62,318 $ 36,225 $ 381 $ 20 Benefit obligations ( 71,257 ) ( 38,027 ) ( 1,535 ) ( 765 ) Funded status of plan $ ( 8,939 ) $ ( 1,802 ) $ ( 1,154 ) $ ( 745 ) Amounts Recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Consist of: Noncurrent assets $ 424 $ 19 $ — $ — Current liability ( 232 ) ( 51 ) ( 82 ) ( 47 ) Noncurrent liability ( 9,131 ) ( 1,770 ) ( 1,072 ) ( 698 ) Net amount recognized $ ( 8,939 ) $ ( 1,802 ) $ ( 1,154 ) $ ( 745 ) Amounts Recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Consist of: Net actuarial (gain) loss $ 8,023 $ 8,160 $ ( 117 ) $ ( 181 ) Prior service (credit) cost ( 1,947 ) 190 ( 9 ) ( 4 ) Net actuarial loss and prior service cost related to discontinued operations — 763 — — Net amount recognized $ 6,076 $ 9,113 $ ( 126 ) $ ( 185 ) (1) Includes benefit payments paid directly by the company.

The majority of our pension obligations relate to our U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) qualified pension plans, which comprise 85 % and 82 % of our pension PBO as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 3 % and 1 % of our pension PBO as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, is attributable to our nonqualified domestic pension plans, which provide supplementary retirement benefits to certain employees in excess of the IRS qualified plan limits. International plans comprise 12 % and 17 % of the pension PBO as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are considered defined benefit pension plans for accounting purposes. 106 Table of C ontents In addition to the pension and PRB noncurrent liabilities shown above, Future pension and postretirement benefit obligations on the Consolidated Balance Sheet includes $ 139 million and $ 21 million of other pension and PRB related liabilities as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

The Actuarial loss arising during the period in 2020 is primarily due to a decrease in discount rates during 2020, partially offset by asset returns exceeding our expected return on assets. Current year prior service credit in 2020 was primarily due to the RTC plan change for non-union participants as discussed above. The Actuarial loss arising during the period in 2019 was primarily due to a decrease in discount rates during 2019, partially offset by our asset returns exceeding our expected return on assets.

The PBO discount rate is used for the service cost and interest cost measurements for non-significant plans. Major assumptions used in determining the PRB benefit obligation and net periodic PRB (income) expense are presented in the following table as weighted-averages: Benefit Obligation Net Periodic Benefit (Income) Expense 2020 2019 2020 2019 2018 Discount rate 2.4 % 3.0 % 3.1 % 4.0 % 3.4 % Expected return on assets N/A N/A 5.7 % 7.0 % 7.0 % Assumed health care cost trend rates used in determining the PRB benefit obligation and net periodic PRB (income) expense are as follows: 2020 2019 Health care cost trend rate assumed for next year 5.0 % 6.5 % Rate that the cost trend rate gradually declines to 4.3 % 5.0 % Year that the rate reaches the rate it is assumed to remain at 2026 2026 The weighted-average discount rates used to measure pension and PRB liabilities are based on yield curves developed using high-quality corporate bonds as well as plan specific cash flows. For our significant plans, we utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant discounted projected cash flows. In determining the EROA assumption, we consider the target asset allocation of plan assets, as well as economic and other indicators of future performance. We may consult with and consider the opinions of financial and other professionals in determining the appropriate capital market assumptions. Return projections are validated using a simulation model that incorporates yield curves, credit spreads and risk premiums to project long-term prospective returns. As a result of this analysis at year end 2020, our weighted average pension EROA assumption for 2021 is 6.5 %. Plan Assets. The plans’ investment management objectives include providing the liquidity and asset levels needed to meet current and future benefit payments, while maintaining a prudent degree of portfolio diversification considering interest rate risk and market volatility. Globally, investment strategies generally target a mix of 50 % to 55 % of growth seeking assets and 45 % to 50 % of income generating and hedging assets using a wide set of diversified asset types, fund strategies and investment managers. The growth seeking allocation consists of global public equities in developed and emerging countries, private equity, real estate and multi-asset class strategies. Growth assets include an enhanced alpha strategy that invests in publicly traded equity and fixed income securities, derivatives and foreign currency. Investments in private equity are primarily via limited partnership interests in buy-out strategies with smaller allocations to distressed debt funds. The real estate strategy is principally concentrated in directly held U.S. core investments with some smaller investments in international, value-added and opportunistic strategies. Within the income generating assets, the fixed income portfolio consists of mainly government and broadly diversified high quality corporate bonds. The plans have continued their pension risk management techniques designed to reduce their interest rate risk. Specifically, the plans have incorporated liability hedging programs that include the adoption of a risk reduction objective as part of the long-term investment strategy. Under this objective the interest rate hedge is intended to increase as funded status improves. The hedging programs incorporate a range of assets and investment tools, each with varying interest rate sensitivities. The 109 Table of C ontents investment portfolios are currently hedging approximately 30 % to 70 % of the interest rate sensitivity of the pension plan liabilities, depending on the funded status of the plan.

The fair market value of the plans’ derivatives through direct or separate account investments was approximately $ 176 million and $ 75 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We review our assets at least quarterly to ensure we are within the targeted asset allocation ranges and, if necessary, asset balances are adjusted back within target allocations. We employ a broadly diversified investment manager structure that includes diversification by active and passive management, style, capitalization, country, sector, industry and number of investment managers. No individual investment represented more than 5 % of the plan assets as of December 31, 2020. The fair value measurement of plan assets using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) changed due to the following: (dollars in millions) Private Equities Corporate Bonds Real Estate Total Balance, December 31, 2018 $ 133 $ 18 $ 1,387 $ 1,538 Realized losses — — ( 2 ) ( 2 ) Unrealized gains relating to instruments still held in the reporting period 32 — 27 59 Purchases, sales, and settlements, net 37 ( 13 ) 52 76 Balance, December 31, 2019 202 5 1,464 1,671 Realized gains — — 7 7 Unrealized gains relating to instruments still held in the reporting period 16 — ( 129 ) ( 113 ) Purchases, sales, and settlements, net 10 ( 3 ) 77 84 Transfers in/out, net ( 228 ) — 228 — Balance, December 31, 2020 $ — $ 2 $ 1,647 $ 1,649 Quoted market prices are used to value investments when available. Investments in securities traded on exchanges, including listed futures and options, are valued at the last reported sale prices on the last business day of the year or, if not available, the last reported bid prices. Fixed income securities are primarily measured using a market approach pricing methodology, where observable prices are obtained by market transactions involving identical or comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings. Mortgages have been valued on the basis of their future principal and interest payments discounted at prevailing interest rates for similar investments. Investment contracts are valued at fair value by discounting the related cash flows based on current yields of similar instruments with comparable durations. Real estate investments are valued on a quarterly basis using discounted cash flow models which consider long-term lease estimates, future rental receipts and estimated residual values. Valuation estimates are supplemented by third-party appraisals on an annual basis. Private equity limited partnerships are valued quarterly using discounted cash flows, earnings multiples and market multiples. Valuation adjustments reflect changes in operating results, financial condition, or prospects of the applicable portfolio company. Over-the-counter securities and government obligations are valued at the bid prices or the average of the bid and ask prices on the last business day of the year from published sources or, if not available, from other sources considered reliable, generally broker quotes. Temporary cash investments are stated at cost, which approximates fair value. The fair market value of assets related to our PRB benefits was $ 381 million and $ 20 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. These assets include $ 149 million of which are invested in our domestic qualified pension plan trust at December 31, 2020. There were no PRB assets invested in our domestic qualified pension plan trust at December 31, 2019. The remaining PRB investments are held within Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trusts. The VEBA assets are generally invested in mutual funds and are valued primarily using quoted prices in active markets (Level 1). There were no Level 3 investments in the VEBA trusts as of December 31, 2020 or 2019. 111 Table of C ontents We have set aside assets in separate trusts, which we expect to be used to pay for certain nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution plan obligations in excess of qualified plan limits. These assets are included in Other assets, current in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The fair value of marketable securities held in trusts consisted of the following: (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 Marketable securities held in trusts $ 881 $ — NOTE 12: LEASES Operating lease expense was $ 497 million and $ 323 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively. Finance leases and lessor leases are not considered significant to our Consolidated Balance Sheet or Consolidated Statement of Operations. Variable least cost and sublease income were immaterial in 2020 and 2019. In 2020, we entered into a sale and leaseback transaction for the sale of equipment and related maintenance. We subsequently leased back the equipment sold for a limited timeframe, which is accounted for as an operating lease. The proceeds received as a result of the equipment sales have been classified in decrease in Customer Financing Assets within the Investing Activities in our Consolidated statement of cash flows, and the portion related to future maintenance services has been classified within Operating Activities. The net gain as a result of this transaction was not material. Gains and losses on sale and leaseback transactions were immaterial in 2019. Supplemental cash flow information related to operating leases were as follows: (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 Operating cash flows used in the measurement of operating lease liabilities $ 420 $ 411 Operating lease right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for operating lease obligations 299 123 Future lease payments related to our operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2020 are as follows: (dollars in millions) 2021 $ 632 2022 468 2023 335 2024 231 2025 158 Thereafter 646 Total undiscounted lease payments (1) 2,470 Less imputed interest ( 472 ) Total discounted lease payments $ 1,998 (1) Total future lease payments excluded approximately $ 58 million of future lease payments related to leases that were signed but had not yet commenced as of December 31, 2020. Our lease liabilities recognized in our Consolidated Balance Sheet were as follows as of December 31: (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 Operating lease liabilities, current (included in Other accrued liabilities) $ ( 482 ) $ ( 245 ) Operating lease liabilities, noncurrent ( 1,516 ) ( 1,093 ) Total operating lease liabilities $ ( 1,998 ) $ ( 1,338 ) The weighted-average remaining lease term related to our operating leases was 8.0 years and 8.6 years as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The weighted-average discount rate related to our operating leases was 3.1 % and 3.5 % as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. 112 Table of C ontents NOTE 13: INCOME TAXES Income Before Income Taxes. The sources of income from continuing operations before income taxes are: (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 United States $ ( 2,762 ) $ 1,594 $ 635 Foreign 409 2,558 1,869 $ ( 2,353 ) $ 4,152 $ 2,504 The Company no longer intends to reinvest certain undistributed earnings of its international subsidiaries that have been previously taxed in the U.S. As such, we recorded the taxes associated with the future remittance of these earnings. For the remainder of the Company’s undistributed international earnings, unless tax effective to repatriate, the Company will continue to permanently reinvest these earnings. As of December 31, 2020, such undistributed earnings were approximately $ 12 billion, excluding other comprehensive income amounts. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable on the remaining amounts. Provision for Income Taxes. The income tax expense (benefit) for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 consisted of the following components: (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Current: United States: Federal $ 324 $ ( 100 ) $ ( 68 ) State 45 ( 58 ) 1 Foreign 305 541 402 674 383 335 Future: United States: Federal ( 264 ) 121 45 State 258 56 58 Foreign ( 93 ) ( 139 ) 660 ( 99 ) 38 763 Income tax expense $ 575 $ 421 $ 1,098 Attributable to items credited (charged) to equity $ ( 576 ) $ 40 $ 501 Reconciliation of Effective Income Tax Rate. Differences between effective income tax rates and the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate are as follows: 2020 2019 2018 (dollars in millions) Amount Rate Amount Rate Amount Rate Statutory U.S. federal income tax rate $ ( 494 ) 21.0 % $ 872 21.0 % $ 526 21.0 % Tax on international activities 35 ( 1.5 ) 32 0.7 ( 25 ) ( 1.0 ) Tax audit settlements — — ( 290 ) ( 7.0 ) — — U.S. tax reform — — — — 744 29.7 Tax charges related to Separation Transactions and Raytheon Merger 416 ( 17.7 ) — — — — Disposals of businesses 177 ( 7.5 ) — — — — U.S. research and development credit ( 142 ) 6.1 ( 101 ) ( 2.4 ) ( 73 ) ( 2.9 ) Goodwill impairment 668 ( 28.4 ) — — — — State income tax, net ( 56 ) 2.4 16 0.4 ( 6 ) ( 0.2 ) Foreign Derived Intangible Income (FDII) ( 83 ) 3.5 ( 138 ) ( 3.3 ) ( 102 ) ( 4.1 ) Other 54 ( 2.3 ) 30 0.7 34 1.3 Effective income tax rate $ 575 ( 24.4 ) % $ 421 10.1 % $ 1,098 43.8 % 113 Table of C ontents The 2020 negative effective tax rate is a result of having tax expense of $ 575 million on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $ 2,353 million. The loss from continuing operations before income taxes includes the $ 3,183 million goodwill impairment as described in “Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets,” most of which is non-deductible for tax purposes. Tax expense includes net deferred tax charges of $ 367 million resulting from the Separation Transactions and the Raytheon Merger primarily related to the impairment of deferred tax assets, and incremental tax expense of $ 177 million related to the disposal of businesses, including the sales of the Collins Aerospace and RIS businesses and the entry into a definitive agreement to sell Forcepoint, as described in “Note 2: Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets.” As a result of the Separation Transactions and the restructuring charges recognized in 2020, tax expense also includes $ 49 million related to revaluation of the tax benefit for certain international tax incentives, as the Company no longer expects to meet the incentive requirements. Also included in the 2020 effective tax rate are tax benefits of $ 142 million associated with U.S. research and development credits and $ 83 million associated with FDII. The 2019 effective tax rate includes tax benefits of $ 290 million primarily associated with the conclusion of the audit by the Examination Division of the Internal Revenue Service for the Company’s 2014, 2015 and 2016 tax years and the filing by a subsidiary of the Company to participate in an amnesty program offered by the Italian Tax Authority. The 2019 effective tax rate also includes tax benefits of $ 138 million associated with FDII and $ 101 million related to U.S. research and development credits. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) was enacted. The 2018 effective tax rate reflects a net charge of $ 744 million for TCJA related adjustments. The amount primarily relates to non-U.S. taxes that will become due when previously reinvested earnings of certain international subsidiaries are remitted. The 2018 effective tax rate also includes tax benefits of $ 102 million associated with FDII and $ 73 million related to U.S. research & development credits. Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities. The tax effects of temporary differences and tax carryforwards which gave rise to future income tax benefits and payables at December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows: (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 Future income tax benefits: Insurance and employee benefits $ 3,004 $ 959 Inventory and contract balances 822 664 Warranty provisions 220 208 Other basis differences 637 614 Tax loss carryforwards 196 348 Tax credit carryforwards 959 930 Valuation allowances ( 757 ) ( 432 ) $ 5,081 $ 3,291 Future income taxes payable: Goodwill and Intangible assets $ 7,786 $ 4,205 Fixed assets 1,637 1,016 Other basis differences 151 638 $ 9,574 $ 5,859 Valuation allowances have been established primarily for tax credit carryforwards, tax loss carryforwards, and certain temporary differences to reduce the future income tax benefits to expected realizable amounts. 114 Table of C ontents Tax Credit and Loss Carryforwards. At December 31, 2020, tax credit carryforwards, principally state and foreign, and tax loss carryforwards, principally state and foreign, were as follows: (dollars in millions) Tax Credit Carryforwards Tax Loss Carryforwards Expiration period: 2021-2025 $ 50 $ 126 2026-2030 38 58 2031-2040 341 179 Indefinite 530 801 Total $ 959 $ 1,164 Unrecognized Tax Benefits. At December 31, 2020, we had gross tax-effected unrecognized tax benefits of $ 1,225 million, of which $ 1,216 million, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits and interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 is as follows: (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Balance at January 1 $ 1,347 $ 1,619 $ 1,189 Additions for tax positions related to the current year 125 131 192 Additions for tax positions of prior years 323 73 344 Reductions for tax positions of prior years ( 83 ) ( 101 ) ( 91 ) Settlements ( 48 ) ( 375 ) ( 15 ) Separation of Carrier and Otis ( 439 ) Balance at December 31 $ 1,225 $ 1,347 $ 1,619 Gross interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits $ 50 $ 57 $ 37 Total accrued interest balance at December 31 141 249 255 The unrecognized tax benefit table includes discontinued operations in 2018, 2019 and 2020. As a result of the Separation Transactions and the Distributions in April 2020, we transferred unrecognized tax benefits to Carrier and Otis of $ 439 million and associated interest of approximately $ 165 million. Pursuant to the terms of the separation agreements, certain other unrecognized tax benefits retained by the Company will be subject to indemnification. Total unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2019 and 2018 include $ 437 million and $ 551 million of benefits related to discontinued operations, and associated interest of approximately $ 155 million in both periods. In addition, as a result of the Raytheon Merger in April 2020, unrecognized tax benefits increased by $ 273 million, and associated interest of approximately $ 15 million, due to inclusion of items related to pre-merger Raytheon Company tax periods. The 2018 additions above include amounts related to the Rockwell Acquisition. Management has determined that the distributions of Carrier and Otis on April 3, 2020, and certain related internal business separation transactions, qualified as tax-free under applicable law. In making these determinations, we applied the tax law in the relevant jurisdictions to our facts and circumstances and obtained tax rulings from the relevant taxing authorities, tax opinions, and/or other external tax advice related to the concluded tax treatment. If the completed distributions of Carrier or Otis, in each case, or certain internal business separation transactions, were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment, the Company could be subject to significant liabilities, and there could be material adverse impacts on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods. We conduct business globally and, as a result, Raytheon Technologies or one or more of our subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Philippines, Poland, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the United States. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations for years before 2012. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company recognized a non-cash gain of approximately $ 25 million, primarily tax, as a result of the statute of limitations expiration of the 2016 tax year of a subsidiary acquired as part of the RTC’s acquisition of Rockwell Collins. During 2019, the Company recognized a net gain of approximately $ 307 million, including pre-tax interest of approximately $ 56 million as a result of the conclusion of the IRS audit of the Company’s 2014, 2015 and 2016 tax years as well as an 115 Table of C ontents amnesty filing in Italy made to resolve certain tax litigation. The Company also recognized a non-cash gain of approximately $ 40 million, primarily tax, as a result of the closure of an IRS audit of the 2014 tax year of a subsidiary acquired as part of RTC’s acquisition of Rockwell Collins. This gain was partially offset by the unfavorable pre-tax impact of a reversal of a related indemnity asset of approximately $ 23 million. Finally, the Company recognized net non-cash gains of approximately $ 18 million, including pre-tax interest of approximately $ 5 million, as a result of various federal, state and non-U.S. statute of limitations expirations and settlements with tax authorities. The Examination Division of the IRS is currently auditing Raytheon Technologies tax years 2017 and 2018 and pre-merger Raytheon Company tax periods 2017, 2018 and 2019 as well as certain refund claims of Raytheon Company for tax years 2014, 2015 and 2016 filed prior to the Raytheon Merger. The Examination Division of the IRS is also auditing pre-acquisition Rockwell Collins fiscal tax years 2016 and 2017, which is projected to close within the next six months. As a result of the projected closure of the audit of Rockwell Collins fiscal tax years 2016 and 2017, it is reasonably possible that the Company may recognize non-cash gains in the range of $ 50 million to $ 100 million, primarily tax, within the next six months. It is reasonably possible that a net reduction within the range of $ 165 million to $ 475 million of unrecognized tax benefits may occur over the next 12 months as a result of the revaluation of uncertain tax positions arising from the issuance of legislation, regulatory or other guidance or developments in examinations, in appeals, or in the courts, or the closure of tax statutes. NOTE 14: RESTRUCTURING COSTS Restructuring costs are generally expensed as incurred. All U.S. government unallowable restructuring costs related to the Raytheon Merger are recorded within Corporate expenses and other unallocated items, as these costs are not included in management’s evaluation of the segments’ performance, and as a result, there are no unallowable restructuring costs at the RIS and RMD segments. During 2020, we recorded net pre-tax restructuring costs totaling $ 777 million for new and ongoing restructuring actions. We recorded charges in the segments as follows: (dollars in millions) Pratt & Whitney $ 183 Collins Aerospace Systems 360 Corporate expenses and other unallocated items 234 Total $ 777 Restructuring charges incurred in 2020 primarily relate to actions initiated during 2020 and 2019, and were recorded as follows: (dollars in millions) Cost of sales $ 397 Selling, general & administrative 371 Restructuring costs recorded within operating expenses 768 Non-service pension (benefit) 9 Total $ 777 2020 Actions. During 2020, we recorded net pre-tax restructuring costs totaling $ 770 million for restructuring actions initiated in 2020, consisting of $ 401 million in Cost of sales, $ 360 million in Selling, general and administrative expenses and $ 9 million in Non-service pension expenses. The 2020 actions primarily relate to severance and restructuring actions at Pratt & Whitney and Collins Aerospace in response to the impact on our operating results related to the current economic environment primarily caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Raytheon Merger, and ongoing cost reduction efforts, including workforce reductions and consolidation of field operations. We are targeting to complete in 2021 the majority of the remaining workforce and all facility related cost reduction actions initiated in 2020. No specific plans for significant other actions have been finalized at this time. The following table summarizes the accrual balances and utilization by cost type for the 2020 restructuring actions: (dollars in millions) Severance Facility Exit and Other Costs Total Net pre-tax restructuring costs $ 744 $ 26 $ 770 Utilization, foreign exchange and other costs ( 410 ) ( 20 ) ( 430 ) Balance at December 31, 2020 $ 334 $ 6 $ 340 116 Table of C ontents The following table summarizes expected, incurred and remaining costs for the 2020 restructuring actions by segment: (dollars in millions) Expected Costs Cost Incurred During 2020 Remaining Costs at December 31, 2020 Pratt & Whitney $ 205 $ ( 205 ) $ — Collins Aerospace Systems 373 ( 333 ) 40 Corporate expenses and other unallocated items 232 ( 232 ) — Total $ 810 $ ( 770 ) $ 40 2019 Actions. During 2020, we recorded net pre-tax restructuring costs totaling $ 10 million for restructuring actions initiated in 2019, consisting of a reversal of $ 2 million in Cost of sales and $ 12 million in Selling, general and administrative expenses. The 2019 actions relate to ongoing cost reduction efforts, including workforce reductions and the consolidation of field operations. The following table summarizes the accrual balances and utilization by cost type for the 2019 restructuring actions: (dollars in millions) Severance Facility Exit and Other Costs Total Restructuring accruals at January 1, 2020 $ 47 $ 11 $ 58 Net pre-tax restructuring costs 6 4 10 Utilization, foreign exchange and other costs ( 41 ) ( 5 ) ( 46 ) Balance at December 31, 2020 $ 12 $ 10 $ 22 The following table summarizes expected, incurred and remaining costs for the 2019 programs by segment: (dollars in millions) Expected Costs Costs Incurred During 2019 Costs Incurred During 2020 Remaining Costs at December 31, 2020 Pratt & Whitney $ 121 $ ( 133 ) $ 12 $ — Collins Aerospace Systems 107 ( 27 ) ( 22 ) 58 Corporate expenses and other unallocated items 2 ( 2 ) — — Total $ 230 $ ( 162 ) $ ( 10 ) $ 58 2018 and Prior Actions. During 2020, we reversed net pre-tax restructuring costs totaling $ 3 million for restructuring actions initiated in 2018 and prior. As of December 31, 2020, we have $ 45 million of accrual balances remaining related to 2018 and prior actions. NOTE 15: FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS We enter into derivative instruments primarily for risk management purposes, including derivatives designated as hedging instruments under the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the FASB ASC and those utilized as economic hedges. We operate internationally and in the normal course of business, are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. These fluctuations can increase the costs of financing, investing and operating the business. We have used derivative instruments, including swaps, forward contracts and options to manage certain foreign currency, interest rate and commodity price exposures. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency hedges was $ 11.6 billion and $ 13.0 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Additional information pertaining to foreign exchange and hedging activities is included in “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles.” 117 Table of C ontents The following table summarizes the fair value and presentation in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for derivative instruments as of December 31: (dollars in millions) Balance Sheet Location 2020 2019 Derivatives designated as hedging instruments: Foreign exchange contracts Other assets, current $ 197 $ 23 Other accrued liabilities 66 166 Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Foreign exchange contracts Other assets, current 44 23 Other accrued liabilities 32 116 The effect of cash flow hedging relationships on accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are presented in the table below. The amounts of gain or (loss) are attributable to foreign exchange contract activity and are recorded as a component of Product sales when reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Year Ended December 31, (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 Gain (loss) recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss $ 181 $ ( 33 ) Loss reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive loss into Product sales 82 51 The Company utilizes the critical terms match method in assessing derivatives for hedge effectiveness. Accordingly, the hedged items and derivatives designated as hedging instruments are highly effective. We have approximately € 500 million of euro-denominated long-term debt, which qualifies as a net investment hedge against our investments in European businesses . As of December 31, 2020, the net investment hedge is deemed to be effective. Assuming current market conditions continue, a $ 23 million pre-tax gain is expected to be reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive loss into Product sales to reflect the fixed prices obtained from foreign exchange hedging within the next 12 months. At December 31, 2020, all derivative contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges will mature b y January 2028. The effect of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments within Other income, net, on the Consolidated Statement of Operations was as follows: Year Ended December 31, (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 Foreign exchange contracts gain (loss) $ ( 76 ) $ 91 NOTE 16: FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS In accordance with the provisions of ASC 820, the following tables provide the valuation hierarchy classification of assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value and measured on a recurring basis in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2020 and 2019: December 31, 2020 (dollars in millions) Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Recurring fair value measurements: Marketable securities held in trusts $ 881 $ 773 $ 108 $ — Derivative assets 241 — 241 — Derivative liabilities ( 98 ) — ( 98 ) — 118 Table of C ontents December 31, 2019 (dollars in millions) Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Recurring fair value measurements: Available-for-sale securities $ 53 $ 53 $ — $ — Derivative assets 46 — 46 — Derivative liabilities ( 282 ) — ( 282 ) — Valuation Techniques. Our available-for-sale securities include equity investments that are traded in active markets, either domestically or internationally, and are measured at fair value using closing stock prices from active markets. Our derivative assets and liabilities include foreign exchange contracts that are measured at fair value using internal models based on observable market inputs such as forward rates, interest rates, our own credit risk and our counterparties’ credit risks. As of December 31, 2020, there has not been any significant impact to the fair value of our derivative liabilities due to our own credit risk. Similarly, there has not been any significant adverse impact to our derivative assets based on our evaluation of our counterparties’ credit risks.

IAE’s business purpose is to coordinate the design, development, manufacturing and product support of the V2500 engine program through involvement with the collaborators. Additionally, Pratt & Whitney, JAEC and MTU are participants in International Aero Engines, LLC (IAE LLC), whose business purpose is to coordinate the design, development, manufacturing and product support for the PW1100G-JM engine for the Airbus A320neo aircraft and the PW1400G-JM engine for the Irkut MC-21 aircraft. Pratt & Whitney holds a 59 % program share interest and a 59 % ownership interest in IAE LLC. IAE and IAE LLC retain limited equity with the primary economics of the programs passed to the participants. As such, we have determined that IAE and IAE LLC are variable interest entities with Pratt & Whitney the primary beneficiary. IAE and IAE LLC have, 119 Table of C ontents therefore, been consolidated. The carrying amounts and classification of assets and liabilities for variable interest entities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows: (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 Current assets $ 6,652 $ 5,448 Noncurrent assets 868 894 Total assets $ 7,520 $ 6,342 Current liabilities $ 7,365 $ 6,971 Noncurrent liabilities 89 94 Total liabilities $ 7,454 $ 7,065 NOTE 18: GUARANTEES We extend a variety of financial, market value and product performance guarantees to third parties. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the following financial guarantees were outstanding: December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 (dollars in millions) Maximum Potential Payment Carrying Amount of Liability Maximum Potential Payment Carrying Amount of Liability Commercial aerospace financing guarantees $ 322 $ 6 $ 333 $ 7 Performance guarantees 386 3 48 — We have made residual value and other guarantees related to various commercial aerospace customer financing arrangements. The estimated fair market values of the guaranteed assets equal or exceed the value of the related guarantees, net of existing reserves. Collaborative partner share of these financing guarantees is $ 142 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019. We also have obligations arising from sales of certain businesses and assets, including those from representations and warranties and related indemnities for environmental, health and safety, tax and employment matters. The maximum potential payment related to these obligations is not a specified amount as a number of the obligations do not contain financial caps. The carrying amount of liabilities related to these obligations was $ 120 million and $ 166 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For additional information regarding the environmental indemnifications, see “Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies.” We accrue for costs associated with guarantees when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of currently available facts, and where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, the minimum is accrued. We provide service and warranty policies on our products and extend performance and operating cost guarantees beyond our normal service and warranty policies on some of our products, particularly commercial aircraft engines. In addition, we incur discretionary costs to service our products in connection with specific product performance issues. Liabilities for performance and operating cost guarantees are based upon future product performance and durability, and are largely estimated based upon historical experience. Adjustments are made to accruals as claim data and historical experience warrant. The changes in the carrying amount of service and product warranties and product performance guarantees for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows: (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 Balance as of January 1 $ 1,033 $ 929 Warranties and performance guarantees issued 311 444 Settlements ( 292 ) ( 330 ) Other 5 ( 10 ) Balance as of December 31 $ 1,057 $ 1,033 NOTE 19: COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Except as otherwise noted, while we are unable to predict the final outcome, based on information currently available, we do not believe that resolution of any of the following matters will have a material adverse effect upon our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. 120 Table of C ontents Environmental. Our operations are subject to environmental regulation by federal, state and local authorities in the United States and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our foreign operations. As described in “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles,” we have accrued for the costs of environmental remediation activities, including but not limited to investigatory, remediation, operating and maintenance costs and performance guarantees, and periodically reassess these amounts. We believe that the likelihood of incurring losses materially in excess of amounts accrued is remote. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $ 835 million and $ 725 million, respectively, reserved for environmental remediation. Additional information pertaining to environmental matters is included in “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles.” Commercial Aerospace Financing and Other Commitments. We had commercial aerospace financing commitments and other contractual commitments of approximately $ 13.4 billion and $ 15.0 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, on a gross basis before reduction for our collaboration partners’ share. Aircraft financing commitments, in the form of debt or lease financing, are provided to certain commercial aerospace customers. The extent to which the financing commitments will be utilized is not currently known, since customers may be able to obtain more favorable terms from other financing sources. We may also arrange for third-party investors to assume a portion of these commitments. The majority of financing commitments are collateralized arrangements. We may also lease aircraft and subsequently sublease the aircraft to customers under long-term non-cancelable operating leases. Our financing commitments with customers are contingent upon maintenance of certain levels of financial condition by the customers. Associated risks on these commitments are mitigated due to the fact that interest rates are variable during the commitment term and are set at the date of funding based on current market conditions, the fair value of the underlying collateral and the credit worthiness of the customers. As a result, the fair value of these financing commitments is expected to equal the amounts funded. We also have other contractual commitments, including commitments to make payments to secure certain contractual rights to provide product on new aircraft platforms, which are included in “Other commercial aerospace commitments” in the table below. Payments made on these contractual commitments are included within intangible assets as exclusivity assets and are amortized over the term of underlying economic benefit. We have entered into certain collaboration arrangements, which may include participation by our collaboration partners in these commitments. In addition, in connection with our 2012 agreement to acquire Rolls-Royce’s ownership and collaboration interests in IAE, additional payments are due to Rolls-Royce contingent upon each hour flown through June 2027 by the V2500-powered aircraft in service as of the acquisition date. These flight hour payments, which are also considered in “Other commercial aerospace commitments” below, are being capitalized as collaboration intangible assets. The following is the expected maturity of commercial aerospace industry commitments as of December 31, 2020: (dollars in millions) Committed 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 Thereafter Commercial aerospace financing commitments $ 3,883 $ 781 $ 745 $ 1,216 $ 1,024 $ 82 $ 35 Other commercial aerospace commitments 9,534 521 533 602 510 410 6,958 Collaboration partners’ share ( 4,902 ) ( 415 ) ( 437 ) ( 667 ) ( 587 ) ( 150 ) ( 2,646 ) Total commercial aerospace commitments $ 8,515 $ 887 $ 841 $ 1,151 $ 947 $ 342 $ 4,347 Other Financing Arrangements. We have entered into standby letters of credit and surety bonds with financial institutions to meet various bid, performance, warranty, retention and advance payment obligations for us or our affiliates. We enter into these agreements to assist certain affiliates in obtaining financing on more favorable terms, making bids on contracts and performing their contractual obligations. The stated values of these letters of credit agreements and surety bonds totaled $ 4.5 billion as of December 31, 2020. Offset Obligations. We have entered into industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes in the form of either offset agreements or ICIP agreements, as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services from certain customers in foreign countries. At December 31, 2020, the aggregate amount of our offset agreements, both agreed to and anticipated to be agreed to, had an outstanding notional value of approximately $ 11.0 billion. These agreements are designed to return economic value to the foreign country by requiring us to engage in activities supporting local defense or commercial industries, promoting a balance of trade, developing in-country technology capabilities or addressing other local development priorities. Offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require a direct cash payment, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing, training and other consulting support to in-country projects, and the purchase by third parties (e.g., our vendors) of supplies from in-country vendors. These agreements may also be satisfied through our use of cash for activities such as subcontracting with local partners, purchasing supplies from in-country vendors, providing financial support for in-country 121 Table of C ontents projects and making investments in local ventures. Such activities may also vary by country depending upon requirements as dictated by their governments. We typically do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive. The amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customers and typically require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the notional value in the offset agreements. Offset programs usually extend over several or more years and may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirements. Historically, we have not been required to pay any penalties of significance. Government Oversight . In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries and our properties are subject to regulatory and governmental examinations, information gathering requests, inquiries, investigations and threatened legal actions and proceedings. For example, we are now, and believe that, in light of the current U.S. government contracting environment, we will continue to be the subject of one or more U.S. government investigations. Our contracts with the U.S. government are also subject to audits. Agencies that oversee contract performance include: the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA), the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), the Inspectors General of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and other departments and agencies, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the Department of Justice (DOJ), and Congressional Committees. Other areas of our business operations may also be subject to audit and investigation by these and other agencies. From time to time, agencies investigate or conduct audits to determine whether our operations are being conducted in accordance with applicable requirements. Such investigations and audits may be initiated due to a number of reasons, including as a result of a whistleblower complaint. Such investigations and audits could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, including repayments, fines, treble or other damages, forfeitures, restitution, or penalties being imposed upon us, the suspension of government export licenses or the suspension or debarment from future U.S. government contracting. U.S. government investigations often take years to complete. The U.S. government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent, criminal or other seriously improper conduct. The U.S. government could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud. Like many defense contractors, we have received audit reports recommending the reduction of certain contract prices because, for example, cost or pricing data or cost accounting practices used to price and negotiate those contracts may not have conformed to government regulations. Some of these audit reports recommend that certain payments be repaid, delayed, or withheld, and may involve substantial amounts. We have made voluntary refunds in those cases we believe appropriate, have settled some allegations and, in some cases, continue to negotiate and/or litigate. The Company may be, and has been, required to make payments into escrow of disputed liabilities while the related litigation is pending. If the litigation is resolved in the Company’s favor, any such payments will be returned to the Company with interest. Our final allowable incurred costs for each year are also subject to audit and have, from time to time, resulted in disputes between us and the U.S. government, with litigation resulting at the Court of Federal Claims (COFC) or the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (ASBCA) or their related courts of appeals. In addition, the DOJ has, from time to time, convened grand juries to investigate possible irregularities by us. We also provide products and services to customers outside of the U.S., and those sales are subject to local government laws, regulations and procurement policies and practices. Our compliance with such local government regulations or any applicable U.S. government regulations (e.g., the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)) may also be investigated or audited. In addition, we accrue for liabilities associated with those matters that are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The most likely liability amount to be incurred is accrued based upon a range of estimates. Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, then we accrue the minimum amount. Other than as specifically disclosed in this Form 10-K, we do not expect these audits, investigations or disputes to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity, either individually or in the aggregate. Legal Proceedings. The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to various litigation matters across jurisdictions, updates to certain of which are set forth below. Cost Accounting Standards Claims As previously disclosed, in April 2019, a Divisional Administrative Contracting Officer (DACO) of the United States DCMA asserted a claim against Pratt & Whitney to recover overpayments of approximately $ 1.73 billion plus interest ($ 681 million at December 31, 2020). The claim is based on Pratt & Whitney’s alleged noncompliance with Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) from January 1, 2007 to March 31, 2019, due to its method of allocating independent research and development costs to government contracts. Pratt & Whitney believes that the claim is without merit and filed an appeal to the ASBCA on June 7, 2019. As previously disclosed, in December 2013, a DCMA DACO asserted a claim against Pratt & Whitney to recover overpayments of approximately $ 177 million plus interest ($ 113 million at December 31, 2020). The claim is based on Pratt & Whitney’s alleged noncompliance with CAS from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2012, due to its method of determining the cost of collaborator parts used in the calculation of material overhead costs for government contracts. In 2014, Pratt & Whitney filed an appeal to the ASBCA. An evidentiary hearing was held and completed in June 2019. The parties concluded post-hearing briefing in January 2020, and now await a decision from the ASBCA. We continue to believe that the claim is without 122 Table of C ontents merit. In December 2018, a DCMA DACO issued a second claim against Pratt & Whitney that similarly alleges that its method of determining the cost of collaborator parts does not comply with the CAS for calendar years 2013 through 2017. This second claim demands payment of $ 269 million plus interest ($ 69 million at December 31, 2020), which we also believe is without merit and which Pratt & Whitney appealed to the ASBCA in January 2019. Thales-Raytheon Systems Matter As previously disclosed, in 2019, Raytheon Company received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) seeking information in connection with an investigation into whether there were improper payments made by Thales-Raytheon Systems (TRS) or anyone acting on their behalf in connection with TRS or Raytheon Company contracts in certain Middle East countries since 2014. In the first quarter of 2020, the DOJ advised Raytheon Company it had opened a parallel investigation. In the third quarter of 2020, Raytheon Company received an additional subpoena from the SEC, seeking information and documents as part of its ongoing investigation. Raytheon Company maintains a rigorous anti-corruption compliance program, is cooperating fully with the SEC’s inquiry, and is examining whether there has been any conduct that is in violation of Raytheon Company policy. At this time, the Company is unable to predict the outcome of the SEC’s or DOJ’s inquiry. Based on the information available to date, however, we do not believe the results of this inquiry will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. DOJ Investigation On October 8, 2020, the Company received a criminal subpoena from the DOJ seeking information and documents in connection with an investigation relating to financial accounting, internal controls over financial reporting, and cost reporting regarding Raytheon Company’s Missiles & Defense business since 2009. We are cooperating fully with the DOJ’s investigation. At this time, the Company is unable to predict the outcome of the investigation. Based on the information available to date, however, we do not believe the results of this inquiry will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Four lawsuits were filed against the Company after the DOJ investigation was first disclosed. A putative securities class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona against the Company and certain of its executives alleging that the defendants violated federal securities laws by making material misstatements in regulatory filings regarding internal controls over financial reporting in the Missiles & Defense business. Three shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against the former Raytheon Company Board of Directors, the Company and certain of its executives, each alleging that defendants violated federal securities laws and breached their fiduciary duties by engaging in improper accounting practices, failing to implement sufficient internal financial and compliance controls, and making a series of false and misleading statements in regulatory filings. We believe that each of these lawsuits lacks merit. Darnis, et al. On August 12, 2020, several former employees of UTC or its subsidiaries filed a putative class action complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut against the Company, Otis, Carrier, the former members of the UTC Board of Directors, and the members of the Carrier and Otis Boards of Directors (Geraud Darnis, et al. v. Raytheon Technologies Corporation, et al.). The complaint challenges the method by which UTC equity awards were converted to Company, Otis, and Carrier equity awards following the separation of UTC into three independent, publicly-traded companies on April 3, 2020. The complaint claims that the defendants are liable for breach of certain equity compensation plans and for breach of fiduciary duty, and also asserts claims under certain provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). We believe that the Company has meritorious defenses to these claims. At this time, the Company is unable to predict the outcome, or the possible range of loss, if any, which could result from this action. Other. As described in “Note 18: Guarantees,” we extend performance and operating cost guarantees beyond our normal warranty and service policies for extended periods on some of our products. We have accrued our estimate of the liability that may result under these guarantees and for service costs that are probable and can be reasonably estimated. We also have other commitments and contingent liabilities related to legal proceedings, self-insurance programs and matters arising out of the normal course of business. We accrue contingencies based upon a range of possible outcomes. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other, then we accrue the minimum amount. Of note, the design, development, production and support of new aerospace technologies is inherently complex and subject to risk. Since the PW1000G Geared TurboFan engine entered into service in 2016, technical issues have been identified and experienced with the engine, which is usual for new engines and new aerospace technologies. Pratt & Whitney has addressed these issues through various improvements and modifications. These issues have resulted in financial impacts, including increased warranty provisions, customer contract settlements, and reductions in contract performance estimates. Additional technical issues, either related to this program or other programs, may also arise in the normal course, which may result in financial impacts that could be material to the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 123 Table of C ontents In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are also routinely defendants in, parties to or otherwise subject to many pending and threatened legal actions, claims, disputes and proceedings. These matters are often based on alleged violations of contract, product liability, warranty, regulatory, environmental, health and safety, employment, intellectual property, tax and other laws. In some instances, claims for substantial monetary damages are asserted against the Company and its subsidiaries and could result in fines, penalties, compensatory or treble damages or non-monetary relief. We do not believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect upon our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. NOTE 20: ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME A summary of the changes in each component of Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, net of tax for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 is provided below: (dollars in millions) Foreign Currency Translation Defined Benefit Pension and Postretirement Plans Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Available-for- Sale Securities Unrealized Hedging (Losses) Gains Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income Balance at December 31, 2017 $ ( 2,950 ) $ ( 4,652 ) $ 5 $ 72 $ ( 7,525 ) Other comprehensive loss before reclassifications, net ( 486 ) ( 1,736 ) — ( 307 ) ( 2,529 ) Amounts reclassified, pre-tax ( 2 ) 344 — ( 16 ) 326 Tax benefit (expense) ( 4 ) 326 — 78 400 ASU 2016-01 adoption impact — — ( 5 ) — ( 5 ) Balance at December 31, 2018 $ ( 3,442 ) $ ( 5,718 ) $ — $ ( 173 ) $ ( 9,333 ) Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications, net 280 ( 584 ) — ( 33 ) ( 337 ) Amounts reclassified, pre-tax 2 170 — 51 223 Tax benefit (expense) ( 43 ) 97 — ( 11 ) 43 ASU 2018-02 adoption impact ( 8 ) ( 737 ) — — ( 745 ) Balance at December 31, 2019 $ ( 3,211 ) $ ( 6,772 ) $ — $ ( 166 ) $ ( 10,149 ) Other comprehensive income before reclassifications, net 609 1,842 — 181 2,632 Amounts reclassified, pre-tax — 373 — 82 455 Tax benefit (expense) 25 ( 510 ) — ( 62 ) ( 547 ) Separation of Carrier and Otis, net of tax 3,287 584 — 4 3,875 Balance at December 31, 2020 $ 710 $ ( 4,483 ) $ — $ 39 $ ( 3,734 ) In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Topic 220) . The standard allows companies to reclassify to retained earnings the stranded tax effects in Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) from the TCJA. We elected to reclassify the income tax effects of TCJA from AOCI of $ 745 million to retained earnings, effective January 1, 2019. In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. This ASU modifies how entities measure equity investments and present changes in the fair value of financial liabilities. Upon adoption, investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method generally must be carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in net income. We had approximately $ 5 million of unrealized gains on these securities recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2017. We adopted this standard effective January 1, 2018, with these amounts recorded directly to retained earnings as of that date. Amounts reclassified that relate to our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans include the amortization of prior service costs and actuarial net losses recognized during each period presented. These costs are recorded as components of net periodic pension cost for each period presented. All noncontrolling interests with redemption features, such as put options, that are not solely within our control (redeemable noncontrolling interests) are reported in the mezzanine section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet, between liabilities and equity, at the greater of redemption value or initial carrying value. 124 Table of C ontents NOTE 21: STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION RTC’s long-term incentive plans authorize various types of market and performance based incentive awards that may be granted to officers and employees. The Raytheon Technologies Corporation 2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan (2018 LTIP) was approved by shareowners on April 30, 2018 (formerly the United Technologies Corporation 2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan). Upon the separation of Carrier and Otis that occurred on April 3, 2020, the shares remaining for future issuance under the 2018 LTIP were adjusted, in accordance with plan rules. With this adjustment, a total of 81.3 million shares have been authorized for issuance pursuant to awards under the 2018 LTIP. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 48 million shares remain available for awards under the 2018 LTIP. The 2018 LTIP does not contain an aggregate annual award limit, however, it sets an annual award limit per participant. Unless shareowners approve a proposal to extend the term of the 2018 LTIP at the Company’s Annual Meeting on April 26, 2021, the 2018 LTIP will expire after all authorized shares have been awarded or April 30, 2028, whichever is sooner. If shareowners approve the proposed extension, the 2018 LTIP will expire after all authorized shares have been awarded or April 26, 2031, whichever is sooner. As a result of the Raytheon Merger, Raytheon Company shares of restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance share units outstand ing prior to the merge, which were issued originally under the Raytheon Company 2010 Stock Plan, as amended and restated, and the Raytheon Company 2018 Stock Plan (together “legacy Raytheon Company Plans”), were converted to Raytheon Technologies shares of restricted stock and RSUs, which resulted in 4.5 million new shares of restricted stock and 2.0 million new R SUs. The conversion of the stock awards resulted in de minimis incremental compensation cost. No new equity awards will be issued under the legacy Raytheon Company Plans. As a result of the Separation Transactions and Distributions, outstanding awards granted to employees under the 2018 LTIP and under its predecessor plan (the amended and restated United Technologies Long-Term Incentive Plan) were converted into Carrier, Otis, and RTC stock-based awards, depending on whether awards were vested or unvested as of April 2, 2020. Vested awards were converted into vested awards of RTX, Carrier and Otis, and unvested awards were generally converted into unvested awards of the employee’s post-separation employer. This conversion resulted in an incremental 1.7 million stock options, 47.1 million stock appreciation rights, 2.7 million performance share units and 5.5 million RSUs. The conversion of the awards resulted in de minimis incremental compensation cost. Additionally, concurrent with the Separation Transactions and Distributions, all performance share units outstanding on April 3, 2020 were converted to RSUs using payout metrics based on a combination of actual performance and the target for the remainder of the performance period. As a result, the performance share units were converted to 4.0 million RSUs, which were then converted into RTC, Carrier or Otis RSUs, as described above. Of these converted awards, 1.4 million stock options, 47.9 million stock appreciation rights and 7.1 million RSUs were converted into Carrier and Otis awards and became obligations of Carrier and Otis due to the Separation Transactions and Distributions. Under the 2018 LTIP, the exercise price of awards is set on the grant date and may not be less than the fair market value per share on that date. Generally, stock appreciation rights and stock options have a term of ten years and a three-year vesting period, subject to limited exceptions. In the event of retirement, annual stock appreciation rights, stock options, and RSUs held for more than one year may become vested and exercisable, subject to certain terms and conditions. LTIP awards with performance-based vesting generally have a minimum three-year vesting period and vest based on actual performance against pre-established metrics. In the event of retirement, performance-based awards held for more than one year, remain eligible to vest based on actual performance relative to performance goals. We have historically repurchased shares of our common stock in an amount at least equal to the number of shares issued under our equity compensation arrangements and will continue to evaluate this policy in conjunction with our overall share repurchase program. We measure the cost of all share-based payments, including stock options and stock appreciation rights, at fair value on the grant date and recognize this cost in the Consolidated Statement of Operations, net of expected forfeitures, as follows: (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Total compensation cost recognized $ 330 $ 268 $ 169 The associated future income tax benefit recognized was $ 63 million, $ 47 million and $ 31 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the amount of cash received from the exercise of stock options was $ 15 million, $ 27 million and $ 36 million, respectively, with an associated tax benefit realized of $ 48 million, $ 75 million and $ 59 million, respectively. In addition, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the associated tax benefit realized from the vesting of performance share units, restricted stock awards and RSUs was $ 58 million, $ 36 million and $ 13 million, respectively. 125 Table of C ontents At December 31, 2020, there was $ 315 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested equity awards granted under long-term incentive plans. This cost is expected to be recognized ratably over a weighted-average period of 2.6 years. A summary of the transactions under our long-term incentive plans for the years ended December 31, 2020 follows. The amounts in the tables and paragraphs below have not been recast for discontinued operations.

The weighted-average grant date fair value of stock options and stock appreciation rights granted during 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $ 23.37 , $ 20.81 and $ 20.24 , respectively. The weighted-average grant date fair value of performance share units, which vest upon achieving certain performance metrics, granted during 2019 and 2018 was $ 117.87 and $ 131.55 , respectively. The total fair value of awards vested during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $ 284 million, $ 211 million and $ 149 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value (which is the amount by which the stock price exceeded the exercise price on the date of exercise) of stock options and stock appreciation rights exercised during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $ 206 million, $ 383 million and $ 283 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value (which is the stock price at vesting multiplied by the number of underlying shares) of performance share units and other restricted awards vested was $ 295 million, $ 188 million and $ 74 million during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The following table summarizes information about equity awards outstanding that are vested and expected to vest as well as equity awards outstanding that are exercisable at December 31, 2020: Equity Awards Vested and Expected to Vest Equity Awards That Are Exercisable (shares in thousands; aggregate intrinsic value in millions) Awards Average Price (1) Aggregate Intrinsic Value Remaining Term (2) Awards Average Price (1) Aggregate Intrinsic Value Remaining Term (2) Stock Options 1,923 $ 77.82 $ — 6.49 754 $ 74.28 $ 2,414 3.86 Stock Appreciation Rights 33,164 77.86 — 6.34 16,766 75.51 42,783 4.45 Restricted Stock and RSUs 10,589 63.07 — 1.63 (1) Weighted-average exercise price per share. (2) Weighted-average contractual remaining term in years. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial lattice model. The following table indicates the assumptions used in estimating fair value for awards granted during 2020, 2019 and 2018. Lattice-based option models incorporate ranges of assumptions for inputs; those ranges are as follows: 2020 2019 2018 Expected volatility 18.8 % 18.8 % - 19.7 % 17.5 % - 21.1 % Weighted-average volatility 19 % 20 % 18 % Expected term (in years) 6.5 6.5 - 6.6 6.5 - 6.6 Expected dividend yield 1.9 % 2.4 % 2.2 % Risk-free rate 1.4 % - 1.6 % 2.3 % - 2.7 % 1.3 % - 2.7 % 126 Table of C ontents Expected volatilities are based on the returns of our stock, including implied volatilities from traded options on our stock for the binomial lattice model. We use historical data to estimate equity award exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model. The expected term represents an estimate of the period of time equity awards are expected to remain outstanding. The risk-free rate is based on the term structure of interest rates at the time of equity award grant. NOTE 22: SEGMENT FINANCIAL DATA Our operations for the periods presented herein are classified into four principal segments: Collins Aerospace, Pratt & Whitney, RIS and RMD. The segments are generally based on the management structure of the businesses and the grouping of similar operating companies, where each management organization has general operating autonomy over diversified products and services. The results of RIS and RMD reflect the period subsequent to the completion of the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020.

Total sales and operating profit by segment include inter-segment sales which are generally recorded at prices approximating those that the selling entity is able to obtain on external sales for our Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney segments, and at cost-plus a specified fee, which may differ from what the selling entity would be able to obtain on sales to external customers, for our RIS and RMD segments. In conjunction with the Raytheon Merger, we revised our measurement of segment performance to reflect how management now reviews and evaluates operating performance. Under the new segment performance measurement, certain acquisition 127 Table of C ontents accounting adjustments are now excluded from segments’ results in order to better represent the ongoing operational performance of those segments. In addition, the majority of Corporate expenses are now allocated to the segments, excluding certain items that remain at Corporate because they are not included in management’s review of the segments’ results. Historical results, discussion and presentation of our business segments reflect the impact of these adjustments for all periods presented. Also as a result of the Raytheon Merger, we now present a FAS/CAS operating adjustment outside of segment results, which represents the difference between the service cost component of our pension and PRB expense under the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) requirements of U.S. GAAP and our pension and PRB expense under U.S. government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) primarily related to our RIS and RMD segments. While the ultimate liability for pension and PRB costs under FAS and CAS is similar, the pattern of cost recognition is different. Over time we generally expect to recover the related RIS and RMD pension and PRB liabilities through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government. Because the Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney segments generally record pension and PRB expense on a FAS basis, historical results were not impacted by this change in segment reporting.

Related amortization expense is included in Acquisition accounting adjustments. Geographic External Sales by Origin and Long-Lived Assets. Geographic external sales are attributed to the geographic regions based on their location of origin. U.S. external sales include export sales to commercial customers outside the U.S. and sales to the U.S. government, commercial and affiliated customers, which are known to be for resale to customers outside the U.S. Long-lived assets are net fixed assets attributed to the specific geographic regions. 128 Table of C ontents External Net Sales Long-Lived Assets (dollars in millions) 2020 2019 2018 2020 2019 United States Operations $ 48,560 $ 35,125 $ 26,646 $ 11,560 $ 7,048 International Operations Europe 3,696 4,419 3,092 1,371 1,268 Asia Pacific 1,574 1,989 1,645 893 917 Middle East and North Africa 103 203 226 137 132 Other 2,654 3,613 3,092 1,001 957 Consolidated $ 56,587 $ 45,349 $ 34,701 $ 14,962 $ 10,322 Disaggregation of Revenue. We also disaggregate our contracts from customers by geographic location based on customer location, by customer and by sales type. Our geographic location based on customer location uses end user customer location where known or practical to determine, or in instances where the end user customer is not known or not practical to determine, we utilize “ship to” location as the customer location. In addition, for our RIS and RMD segments, we disaggregate our contracts from customers by contract type. We believe these categories best depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. Historical results have been recast to reflect the presentation of this disaggregation. Segment sales disaggregated by geographic region for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are as follows: 2020 (dollars in millions) Collins Aerospace Systems Pratt & Whitney Raytheon Intelligence & Space Raytheon Missiles & Defense Other Total United States $ 10,132 $ 8,534 $ 8,500 $ 7,110 $ 284 $ 34,560 Asia Pacific 1,810 4,024 613 1,156 41 7,644 Middle East and North Africa 421 505 376 2,111 30 3,443 Europe 4,643 2,726 307 1,031 149 8,856 Canada and All Other 904 1,001 83 73 23 2,084 Consolidated net sales 17,910 16,790 9,879 11,481 527 56,587 Inter-segment sales 1,378 9 962 179 ( 2,528 ) — Business segment sales $ 19,288 $ 16,799 $ 10,841 $ 11,660 $ ( 2,001 ) $ 56,587 2019 (dollars in millions) Collins Aerospace Systems Pratt & Whitney Raytheon Intelligence & Space Raytheon Missiles & Defense Other Total United States $ 12,762 $ 8,622 $ — $ — $ 13 $ 21,397 Asia Pacific 2,473 5,462 — — — 7,935 Middle East and North Africa 693 837 — — — 1,530 Europe 7,051 4,327 — — — 11,378 Canada and All Other 1,452 1,657 — — — 3,109 Consolidated net sales 24,431 20,905 — — 13 45,349 Inter-segment sales 1,597 ( 3 ) — — ( 1,594 ) — Business segment sales $ 26,028 $ 20,902 $ — $ — $ ( 1,581 ) $ 45,349 129 Table of C ontents 2018 (dollars in millions) Collins Aerospace Systems Pratt & Whitney Raytheon Intelligence & Space Raytheon Missiles & Defense Other Total United States $ 7,079 $ 8,575 $ — $ — $ 12 $ 15,666 Asia Pacific 1,525 5,112 — — — 6,637 Middle East and North Africa 425 457 — — — 882 Europe 5,508 4,023 — — — 9,531 Canada and All Other 748 1,237 — — — 1,985 Consolidated net sales 15,285 19,404 — — 12 34,701 Inter-segment sales 1,349 ( 2 ) — — ( 1,347 ) — Business segment sales $ 16,634 $ 19,402 $ — $ — $ ( 1,335 ) $ 34,701 Segment sales disaggregated by customer for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are as follows: 2020 (dollars in millions) Collins Aerospace Systems Pratt & Whitney Raytheon Intelligence & Space Raytheon Missiles & Defense Other Total U.S. government (1) $ 5,159 $ 5,193 $ 8,309 $ 7,099 $ 202 $ 25,962 Foreign military sales through the U.S. government 218 1,229 593 2,545 — 4,585 Foreign government direct commercial sales 923 583 729 1,736 3 3,974 Commercial aerospace and other commercial 11,610 9,785 248 101 322 22,066 Consolidated net sales 17,910 16,790 9,879 11,481 527 56,587 Inter-segment sales 1,378 9 962 179 ( 2,528 ) — Business segment sales $ 19,288 $ 16,799 $ 10,841 $ 11,660 $ ( 2,001 ) $ 56,587 (1) Excludes foreign military sales through the U.S. government. 2019 (dollars in millions) Collins Aerospace Systems Pratt & Whitney Raytheon Intelligence & Space Raytheon Missiles & Defense Other Total U.S. government (1) $ 4,781 $ 4,313 $ — $ — $ — $ 9,094 Foreign military sales through the U.S. government 255 1,316 — — — 1,571 Foreign government direct commercial sales 937 561 — — — 1,498 Commercial aerospace and other commercial 18,458 14,715 — — 13 33,186 Consolidated net sales 24,431 20,905 — — 13 45,349 Inter-segment sales 1,597 ( 3 ) — — ( 1,594 ) — Business segment sales $ 26,028 $ 20,902 $ — $ — $ ( 1,581 ) $ 45,349 (1) Excludes foreign military sales through the U.S. government. 130 Table of C ontents 2018 (dollars in millions) Collins Aerospace Systems Pratt & Whitney Raytheon Intelligence & Space Raytheon Missiles & Defense Other Total U.S. government (1) $ 2,643 $ 3,917 $ — $ — $ — $ 6,560 Foreign military sales through the U.S. government 195 707 — — — 902 Foreign government direct commercial sales 737 538 — — — 1,275 Commercial aerospace and other commercial 11,710 14,242 — — 12 25,964 Consolidated net sales 15,285 19,404 — — 12 34,701 Inter-segment sales 1,349 ( 2 ) — — ( 1,347 ) — Business segment sales $ 16,634 $ 19,402 $ — $ — $ ( 1,335 ) $ 34,701 (1) Excludes foreign military sales through the U.S. government.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and the Corporate Vice President and Controller (Controller), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Based upon our evaluation, our CEO, CFO and Controller concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO, CFO and Controller, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Our management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in its 2013 Internal Control – Integrated Framework. Our management has concluded that based on its assessment, our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K . There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

United Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries’ names, abbreviations thereof, logos, and product and service designators are all either the registered or unregistered trademarks or tradenames of United Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries. Names, abbreviations of names, logos, and product and service designators of other companies are either the registered or unregistered trademarks or tradenames of their respective owners. As used herein, the terms ""we,"" ""us,"" ""our,"" ""the Company,"" or ""UTC,"" unless the context otherwise requires, mean United Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries. References to internet websites in this Form 10-K are provided for convenience only. Information available through these websites is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K. PART I 4 Item 1. Business General United Technologies Corporation was incorporated in Delaware in 1934. UTC provides high technology products and services to the building systems and aerospace industries worldwide. Growth is attributable primarily to the internal development of our existing businesses and to acquisitions. The following description of our business should be read in conjunction with ""Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" in our 2019 Annual Report, including the information contained therein under the heading ""Business Overview."" Our operations for the periods presented herein are classified into four segments: Otis, Carrier, Pratt & Whitney, and Collins Aerospace Systems, with each segment comprised of groups of similar operating companies. References to each segment include the various operating companies established worldwide through which the operations for each segment are conducted. Otis and Carrier (collectively referred to as the ""commercial businesses"") serve customers in the commercial, government, infrastructure and residential property sectors, and refrigeration and transport sectors worldwide. Pratt & Whitney and Collins Aerospace Systems (collectively referred to as the ""aerospace businesses"") primarily serve commercial and government customers in both the original equipment and aftermarket parts and services markets of the aerospace industry. For 2019, our commercial and industrial sales (generated principally by the commercial businesses) were approximately 41 percent of our consolidated sales, and our commercial and military aerospace sales (generated exclusively by our aerospace businesses) were approximat ely 42 percent and 17 percent, respectively, of our consolidated sales. International sales for 2019, including U.S. export sales, were 60 p ercent of our net sales. On June 9, 2019, UTC entered into a merger agreement with Raytheon Company (Raytheon) providing for an all-stock merger of equals transaction. The Raytheon merger agreement provides, among other things, that each share of Raytheon common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the Raytheon merger (except for shares held by Raytheon as treasury stock) will be converted into the right to receive 2.3348 shares of UTC common stock. Upon the closing of the Raytheon merger, Raytheon will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of UTC, and UTC will change its name to Raytheon Technologies Corporation. On October 11, 2019, the shareowners of each of UTC and Raytheon approved the proposals necessary to complete the Raytheon merger. The Raytheon merger is expected to close early in the second quarter 2020 and is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals, as well as the completion of UTC's separation of its Otis and Carrier businesses (discussed below). As has been previously disclosed, in November 2018, the Company announced its intention to separate into three independent companies. Following the separation transactions, the Company will operate as an aerospace company comprised of the Collins Aerospace Systems and Pratt & Whitney businesses, and Otis and Carrier will become separate independent companies. The proposed separation transactions are expected to be effected through spin-offs of Otis and Carrier that are intended to be tax-free for the Company’s shareowners for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and are expected to be completed early in the second quarter of 2020. Separation of Otis and Carrier from UTC via spin-off transactions is subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including, among others, final approval by the Company’s Board of Directors, receipt of tax rulings and a tax opinion from external counsel, the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and effectiveness of Form 10 registration statements, and satisfactory completion of financing (subject to UTC’s agreement to consummate the distributions pursuant to, and subject to the terms and conditions of, the Raytheon merger agreement). This Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports are available free of charge through the Investors section of our Internet website (http://www.utc.com) under the heading ""SEC Filings"" as soon as reasonably practicable after these reports are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. In addition, the SEC maintains an Internet site (http://www.sec.gov) containing reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. Description of Business by Segment Each segment's business, including its principal products and services and other material developments and information, is described below. Segment financial data for the years 2017 through 2019, including financial information about foreign and domestic operations and export sales, appears in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2019 Annual Report. Segment sales as discussed below include intercompany sales, which are ultimately eliminated within the ""Eliminations and other"" category as reflected in the segment financial data in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2019 Annual Report. Similarly, the total remaining performance obligation (RPO) discussed below includes intercompany RPO. See 5 Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2019 Annual Report for further discussion of the accounting for RPO under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606: Revenue from Contracts with Customers . Otis Otis is the world’s largest elevator and escalator manufacturing, installation and service company. Otis designs, manufactures, sells and installs a wide range of passenger and freight elevators, as well as escalators and moving walkways for residential and commercial buildings and infrastructure projects. In addition to new equipment, Otis performs maintenance and repair services for both its products and those of other manufacturers and provides modernization services to upgrade elevators and escalators. Otis serves customers in the commercial, residential and infrastructure property sectors around the world. Otis sells directly to the end customer and through sales representatives and distributors. Sales generated by Otis’ international operations were 73 percent of total Otis net sales in 2019 and 2018. Otis’ RPO was $16.3 billion and $1 6.4 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Of the total Otis RPO at December 31, 2019, approximately $8.7 billion is expecte d to be realized as sales in 2020. Carrier Carrier is a leading global provider of heating, ventilating, air conditioning (HVAC), refrigeration, fire and security solutions for residential, commercial, industrial and smart cold chain applications. Carrier provides a wide range of residential and building systems, including air conditioners, heating systems and controls, refrigeration, fire, flame, gas, smoke and carbon monoxide detection, portable fire extinguishers, fire suppression, intruder alarms, access control systems, video management systems and electronic controls. Carrier also provides a broad array of related building services, including audit, design, installation, system integration, repair, maintenance, and monitoring services. Carrier sells its HVAC and refrigeration solutions directly to end customers, including building contractors and owners, transportation companies and retail stores, and through joint ventures, independent sales representatives, distributors, wholesalers and dealers. These products and services are sold under the Carrier name and other brand names. Carrier’s security and fire safety products and services are used by governments, financial institutions, architects, building owners and developers, security and fire consultants, homeowners and other end-users requiring a high level of security and fire protection for their businesses and residences. Carrier provides its security and fire safety products and services under Chubb, Kidde and other brand names and sells directly to customers as well as through manufacturer's representatives, distributors, dealers, value-added resellers and retailers. Demand for Carrier’s HVAC products and services is seasonal and can be impacted by weather. Carrier regularly offers incentives and training, such as credits/discounts for offering promotional pricing and contract terms on its products, to its distribution partners to purchase and sell Carrier’s products to ensure an adequate supply of Carrier’s products. Sales generated by Carrier’s international operations, including U.S. export sales, were 52 percent and 54 percent of total Carrier net sales in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Carrier’s RPO was $4.7 billion and $5.3 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Of the total Carrier RPO at December 31, 2019, approximately $3 billion is expected to be realized as sales in 2020. Pratt & Whitney Pratt & Whitney is among the world’s leading suppliers of aircraft engines for the commercial, military, business jet and general aviation markets. Pratt & Whitney provides fleet management services and aftermarket maintenance, repair and overhaul services. Pratt & Whitney designs, develops, produces and maintains families of large engines for wide- and narrow-body and large regional aircraft in the commercial market and for fighter, bomber, tanker and transport aircraft in the military market. Pratt & Whitney Canada (P&WC) is among the world's leading suppliers of engines powering general and business aviation, as well as regional airline, and utility airplanes, and helicopters. Pratt & Whitney and P&WC also produce, sell and service auxiliary power units for military and commercial aircraft. The development of new engines and improvements to current production engines present important growth opportunities. In view of the risks and costs associated with developing new engines, Pratt & Whitney has entered into collaboration arrangements in which revenues, costs and risks are shared with third parties. At December 31, 2019, the interests of third-party participants in Pratt & Whitney-directed commercial jet engine programs ranged, in the aggregate per program, from approximately 13 percent to 49 percent. UTC holds a 61 percent program share interest in the IAE International Aero Engines AG (IAE) collaboration with MTU Aero Engines AG (MTU) and Japanese Aero Engines Corporation (JAEC). Pratt & Whitney also holds a 59 percent program share interest in the International Aero Engines, LLC (IAE LLC) collaboration with MTU and JAEC. Pratt & Whitney sells the PW1100G-JM engine for the Airbus A320neo family of aircraft and the PW1400G- 6 JM engine for the Irkut MC-21 aircraft through IAE LLC. In addition, Pratt & Whitney has interests in other engine programs, including a 50 percent ownership interest in Engine Alliance, LLC (EA), a joint venture with GE Aviation, which sells and provides maintenance services for the GP7000 engine for the Airbus A380 aircraft, which Airbus has announced it no longer intends to manufacture after 2021. Pratt & Whitney has entered into risk and revenue sharing arrangements with third parties for 40 percent of the products and 25 percent of the services that Pratt & Whitney is responsible for providing to the EA. Pratt & Whitney accounts for its interest in the EA joint venture under the equity method of accounting. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2019 Annual Report for a description of our accounting for collaborative arrangements. Pratt & Whitney produces the PW1000G Geared Turbofan engine family, the first of which, the PW1100G-JM, entered into service in January 2016. The PW1000G Geared Turbofan engine has demonstrated a significant reduction in fuel burn and noise levels and lower environmental emissions when compared to legacy engines. The PW1100G-JM engine is offered on the Airbus A320neo family of aircraft. PW1000G Geared Turbofan engine models also power the Airbus A220 passenger aircraft and Embraer’s E-Jet E2 family of aircraft. Additionally, PW1000G Geared Turbofan engine models have been selected to power the new Mitsubishi SpaceJet, and the new Irkut MC-21 passenger aircraft, which are scheduled to enter service in 2020 and 2021, respectively. As previously disclosed, Gulfstream announced the selection of the PW800 engine to exclusively power Gulfstream’s new G500 and G600 business jets. The Gulfstream G500 entered service in 2018, and the Gulfstream G600 entered service in 2019. P&WC's PW800 engine has also been selected to power the new Falcon 6X business jet by Dassault Aviation, which is scheduled to enter into service in 2022. Pratt & Whitney continues to enhance its programs through performance improvement measures and product base expansion. The success of these aircraft and engines is dependent upon many factors, including technological accomplishments, program execution, aircraft demand, and regulatory approval. As a result of these factors, as well as the level of success of aircraft program launches by aircraft manufacturers and other conditions, additional investment in these engine programs may be required. Pratt & Whitney is under contract with the U.S. Government's F-35 Joint Program Office to produce and sustain the F135 engine to power the single-engine F-35 Lightning II aircraft (commonly known as the Joint Strike Fighter) being produced by Lockheed Martin. The two F135 propulsion system configurations for the F-35A, F-35B and F-35C jets are used by the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Navy, respectively. F135 engines are also used on F-35 aircraft purchased by Joint Strike Fighter partner countries and foreign military sales countries. Pratt & Whitney is also under contract to build engines for the U.S. Air Force’s B-21 long-range strike bomber and for the development of next-generation adaptive engines for the U.S. Air Force. Pratt & Whitney’s products are sold principally to aircraft manufacturers, airlines and other aircraft operators, aircraft leasing companies and the U.S. and foreign governments. Pratt & Whitney’s products and services must adhere to strict regulatory and market-driven safety and performance standards. The frequently changing nature of these standards, along with the long duration of aircraft engine development, production and support programs, creates uncertainty regarding engine program profitability. Sales to Airbus (Pratt & Whitney’s largest customer by sales) were 31 percent and 36 percent of total Pratt & Whitney segm ent sales in 2019 and 2018, respectively, before taking into account discounts or financial incentives offered to customers. Sales to the U.S. Government were approximately 27 percent and 23 percent of total Pratt & Whitney segment sales in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Sales generated by Pratt & Whitney’s international operations, including U.S. export sales, were 64 percent and 63 percent of total Pratt & Whitney net sales in 2019 and 2018, respectively. At December 31, 2019, Pratt & Whitney’s RPO was $85.2 billion, including $13.1 billion of U.S. Government contracts and subcontracts. At December 31, 2018, Pratt & Whitney's RPO was $71.1 billion, including $10.0 billion of U.S. Government contracts and subcontracts. Of the total Pratt & Whitney RPO at December 31, 2019, approximately $14 billion is expected to be realized as sales in 2020. Pratt & Whitney’s RPO includes certain contracts for which actual costs may ultimately exceed total sales. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2019 Annual Report for a description of our Revenue Recognition accounting policy which includes discussion of the accounting for long-term contracts and for further disc ussion on RPO under ASC Topic 606: Revenue from Contracts with Customers .

Other Matters Relating to Our Business as a Whole Competition and Other Factors Affecting Our Businesses As worldwide businesses, our operations can be affected by a variety of economic, industry and other factors, including those described in this section, in ""Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" included in our 2019 Annual Report, in Item 1, ""Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results,"" and in Item 1A, ""Risk Factors"" in this Form 10-K. Each business unit is subject to significant competition from a large number of companies in the U.S. and other countries, and each competes on the basis of price, delivery schedule, product performance and service. Our aerospace businesses are subject to substantial competition from various domestic and foreign manufacturers, customers and companies that obtain regulatory agency approval to manufacture spare parts, with foreign companies sometimes receiving government research and development assistance, marketing subsidies and other assistance for certain of their products beyond the assistance that may be available in the U.S. Customer selections of aircraft engines, components and systems can also have a significant impact on future sales of parts and services. In addition, the U.S. Government’s and other governments’ policies of purchasing parts from suppliers other than the original equipment manufacturer affect military spare parts sales. Significant elements of our aerospace businesses, such as spare parts sales for engines and aircraft in service, have short lead times. Therefore, RPO information may not be indicative of future demand. Additionally, our aerospace businesses' competitors may offer substantial discounts and other financial incentives, performance and operating cost guarantees, and participation in financing arrangements in an effort to compete for the aftermarket associated with these products. For information regarding customer financing commitments, participation in guarantees of customer financing arrangements and performance and operating cost guarantees, primarily related to Pratt & Whitney, see Notes 4 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2019 Annual Report. Pratt & Whitney’s major competitors in the sale of engines are GE Aviation, Honeywell, Safran Helicopter Engines, and CFM International. 8 U.S. Government Contracts Contracting with the U.S. Government entails certain unique risks. U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for convenience or for default in the event of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. In the case of a termination for convenience, we would normally be entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred and termination costs. If terminated by the government as a result of our default, we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another so urce and any other damages it suffers. Most of our U.S. Government sales are made under fixed-price contracts, while approximately $2.6 billion or 3 percent of our total sales for 2019 were made under cost-reimbursement type contracts. Our contracts with the U.S. Government are also subject to audits. For further discussion of risks related to government contracting, including on-going litigation associated with U.S. Government audits, see Item 1A, ""Risk Factors"" and Item 3, ""Legal Proceedings,"" in this Form 10-K and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2019 Annual Report. Compliance with Environmental and Other Government Regulations Our operations are subject to and affected by environmental regulation by federal, state and local authorities in the U.S. and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our foreign operations. We have incurred and will likely continue to incur liabilities under various government statutes for the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment. We do not anticipate that compliance with current provisions relating to the protection of the environment or that any payments we may be required to make for cleanup liabilities will have a material adverse effect upon our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations. Environmental matters are further addressed in ""Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" and Notes 1 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2019 Annual Report. Most of the U.S. laws governing environmental matters include criminal provisions. If we were convicted of a violation of the federal Clean Air Act or Clean Water Act, the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be deemed ineligible to be used in performing any U.S. Government contract we are awarded until the Environmental Protection Agency thereafter certifies that the condition giving rise to the violation has been corrected. In addition, we could be affected by future laws or regulations imposed in response to concerns over climate change. Changes in climate-related concerns, or in the regulation of such concerns, including greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including compliance costs and increased energy and raw materials costs. We conduct our businesses through subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide. Changes in legislation or government policies can affect our worldwide operations. For example, governmental regulation of refrigerants, energy efficiency standards and fire safety regulations are important to our Carrier businesses, and elevator safety codes are important to Otis' businesses, while government safety and performance regulations, restrictions on aircraft engine noise and emissions and government procurement practices can impact our aerospace businesses. U.S. laws, regulations, orders, and other measures concerning the export or re-export of products, software, services and technology to, and other trade-related activities involving, non-U.S. countries and parties affect the operations of UTC and its affiliates. For further discussion of risks related to environmental matters and other government regulations, see Item 1A, ""Risk Factors"" and Item 3, ""Legal Proceedings,"" in this Form 10-K and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2019 Annual Report. Intellectual Property and Raw Materials and Supplies We maintain a portfolio of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, licenses and franchises related to our businesses. While we believe we have taken reasonable measures to protect this portfolio, our efforts may not be sufficient. See Item 1A ""Risk Factors"" in this Form 10-K for further discussion of intellectual property matters. We believe we have adequate sources for our purchases of materials, components, services and supplies used in our manufacturing. We work continuously with our supply base to ensure an adequate source of supply and to reduce costs. We pursue cost reductions through a number of mechanisms, including consolidating our purchases, reducing the number of suppliers, strategic global sourcing and competitions among potential suppliers. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers. Like other users in the U.S., we are largely dependent upon foreign sources for certain raw materials, such as cobalt, tantalum, chromium, rhenium and nickel. We have a number of ongoing programs to manage this dependence and the accompanying risk, including long-term agreements and the conservation of materials through scrap reclamation and new manufacturing processes. We believe that our supply management practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. Although at times high prices for some raw materials important to our businesses (for example, steel, 9 copper, aluminum, titanium and nickel) have caused margin and cost pressures, we do not foresee near term unavailability of materials, components or supplies that would have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. For further discussion of the possible effects of the cost and availability of raw materials on our business, including the risks associated with more restrictive trade policies in the U.S., and internationally, and other market risks such as the United Kingdom’s pending withdrawal from the European Union, see Item 1A, “Risk factors” and the section titled “Business Overview"" in ""Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" in this Form 10-K and UTC’s 2019 Annual Report. Employees and Employee Relations At December 31, 2019, our total number of employees was approximately 243,200, of which appro ximately 64% percent are based outside the U.S. During 2019, we negotiated seven domestic collective bargaining agreements, the largest of which covered certain workers at Carrier's Collierville, Tennessee facility. In 2020, numerous collective bargaining agreements are subject to renegotiation, the largest of which covers certain workers at Carrier’s Indianapolis, Indiana and Collins Aerospace Systems' Chula Vista/Riverside, California facilities. Although some previous contract renegotiations have had a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations in prior years, we do not anticipate that the renegotiation of these contracts in 2020 will have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations. For discussion of the effects of our restructuring actions on employment, see Item 1A, ""Risk Factors"" in this Form 10-K and under ""Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2019 Annual Report. For a discussion of other matters which may affect our competitive position, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations, including the risks of our international operations, see the further discussion under the headings ""General"" and ""Description of Business by Segment"" in this section, Item 1A, ""Risk Factors"" in this Form 10-K, and under ""Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" in our 2019 Annual Report. 10 Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results This Form 10-K contains statements which, to the extent they are not statements of historical or present fact, constitute “forward-looking statements” under the securities laws.

• negative effects of the announcement or pendency of the proposed merger with Raytheon or the separation transactions on the market price of our and/or Raytheon’s respective common stock and/or on our respective financial performance; • the ability of UTC and Raytheon to receive the required regulatory approvals for the proposed merger (and the risk that such approvals may result in the imposition of conditions that could adversely affect the combined company or the expected benefits of the transaction) and to satisfy the other conditions to the closing of the merger on a timely basis or at all; • the occurrence of events that may give rise to a right of one or both of UTC or Raytheon to terminate the merger agreement; • risks relating to the value of our shares to be issued in the proposed merger with Raytheon, significant transaction costs and/or unknown liabilities; • the possibility that the anticipated benefits from the proposed merger with Raytheon cannot be realized in full or at all or may take longer to realize than expected, including risks associated with third party contracts containing consent and/or other provisions that may be triggered by the proposed transaction; • risks associated with merger-related litigation; • the possibility that costs or difficulties related to the integration of UTC’s and Raytheon’s operations will be greater than expected; • risks relating to completed merger, acquisition and divestiture activity, including UTC’s integration of Rockwell Collins, including the risk that the integration may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected or may not result in the achievement of estimated synergies within the contemplated time frame or at all; • the ability of each of UTC, Raytheon, the companies resulting from the separation transactions and the combined company to retain and hire key personnel; • the expected benefits and timing of the separation transactions, and the risk that conditions to the separation transactions will not be satisfied and/or that the separation transactions will not be completed within the expected time frame, on the expected terms or at all; • the intended qualification of (i) the merger as a tax-free reorganization and (ii) the separation transactions as tax-free to UTC and UTC’s shareowners, in each case, for U.S. federal income tax purposes; • the possibility that any opinions, consents, approvals or rulings required in connection with the separation transactions will not be received or obtained within the expected time frame, on the expected terms or at all;

Risk Factors Our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by the factors set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. Our Global Growth May be Affected by Global Economic, Capital Market and Political Conditions. Our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions and geopolitical risks, including credit market conditions, levels of consumer and business confidence, commodity prices, exchange rates, levels of government spending and deficits, trade policies, political conditions, actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt and other challenges that could affect the global economy. These economic conditions affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways. Tightening of credit in financial markets could adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations, could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services, and impact the ability of our customers to make payments. Similarly, such tightening of credit may adversely affect our supplier base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy. Our global business is also adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity, such as decreases in business and consumer spending, air travel, construction activity, the financial strength of airlines and business jet operators, and government procurement. Our Financial Performance Is Dependent on the Conditions of the Construction and Aerospace Industries. The results of our commercial businesses, which generated approximately 41 percent of our consolidated sales in 2019, are influenced by a number of external factors including fluctuations in residential and commercial construction activity, regulatory changes, interest rates, labor costs, foreign currency exchange rates, customer attrition, raw material and energy costs, global credit market conditions, and other global and political factors, including trade policies. A slowdown in building and remodeling activity can adversely affect the financial performance of Otis and Carrier. In addition, the financial performance of Carrier can be influenced by production and utilization of transport equipment and, particularly in its residential business, weather conditions. The results of our commercial and military aerospace businesses, which generated approximately 59 percent of our consolidated sales in 2019, are directly tied to the economic conditions in the commercial aviation and defense industries, which are cyclical in nature. Capital spending and demand for aircraft engines, aerospace products and component aftermarket parts and services by commercial airlines, aircraft operators and aircraft manufacturers are influenced by a wide variety of factors, including current and predicted traffic levels, load factors, aircraft fuel prices, labor issues, airline profits, airline consolidation, bankruptcies, competition, the retirement of older aircraft, regulatory changes, terrorism and related safety concerns, general economic conditions, corporate profitability, cost reduction efforts and RPO levels. Any of these factors could reduce the sales and margins of our aerospace businesses. Other factors, including future terrorist actions, aviation safety concerns, pandemic health issues or major natural disasters, could also dramatically reduce the demand for air travel, which could negatively impact the sales and margins of our aerospace businesses. Additionally, because a substantial portion of product deliveries to commercial aerospace customers are scheduled for delivery beyond 2020, changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled. At times, our aerospace businesses also enter into firm fixed-price or cost-share development contracts, which may require us to bear cost overruns related to unforeseen technical and design challenges that arise during the development and early production stages of the program. In addition, our aerospace businesses face intense competition from domestic and foreign manufacturers of new equipment and spare parts. Spare parts sales and aftermarket service trends are affected by similar factors, including usage, pricing, technological improvements, regulatory changes and the retirement of older aircraft. Furthermore, because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing products in these business segments to market, we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is ready to enter into service. A reduction in spending in the commercial aviation or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. The defense industry is also affected by a changing U.S. and global political environment, continued pressure on U.S. and global defense spending, U.S. foreign policy and the level of activity in military flight operations. Should overall U.S. Government defense spending decline, it could result in significant reductions to revenue, cash flow, profit and RPO for our military businesses. One or more of the programs that we currently support or are currently pursuing could be phased-out, limited or terminated. Reductions in these existing programs, unless offset by other programs and opportunities, could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, cash flows, results of operations or financial condition. 13 Our International Operations Subject Us to Economic Risk As Our Results of Operations May Be Adversely Affected by Changes in Foreign Currency Fluctuations, Economic Conditions, Trade Policies, and Changes in Local Government Regulation. We conduct our business on a global basis, with approximately 60% percent of our 2019 total segment sales derived from international operations, including U.S. export sales. Changes in local and regional economic conditions, including fluctuations in exchange rates, may affect product demand and reported profits in our non-U.S. operations (especially the commercial businesses and P&WC), where transactions are generally denominated in local currencies. In addition, currency fluctuations may affect the prices we pay suppliers for materials used in our products. As a result, our operating margins also may be negatively impacted by worldwide currency fluctuations that result in higher costs for certain cross border transactions. Our financial statements are denominated in U.S. Dollars. Accordingly, fluctuations in exchange rates may also give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements of non-U.S. operating units are translated into U.S. Dollars. Given that the majority of our sales are non-U.S. based, a strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against other major foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations. The majority of sales in the aerospace businesses are transacted in U.S. Dollars, consistent with established industry practice, while the majority of costs at locations outside the U.S. are incurred in the applicable local currency (principally the Euro, the Canadian Dollar, the British Pound and the Polish Zloty). For operating units with U.S. Dollar sales and local currency costs, there is foreign currency exposure that could impact our results of operations depending on market changes in the exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar against the applicable foreign currencies. To manage certain exposures, we employ long-term hedging strategies associated with U.S. Dollar sales. See Notes 1 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2019 Annual Report for further discussion of our hedging strategies. Our international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws, regulations and policies, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, taxation, exchange controls, capital controls, employment regulations, and repatriation of earnings. Government policies on international trade and investments such as import quotas, capital controls, taxes or tariffs, whether adopted by individual governments or regional trade blocs, can affect demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to manufacture or sell products in certain countries. The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs, or the renegotiation of existing trade agreements by the U.S. or by countries where we sell large quantities of products and services or procure supplies and other materials incorporated into our products, including in connection with the United Kingdom's pending withdrawal from the European Union, could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, a government's adoption of ""buy national"" policies or retaliation by another government against such policies, such as tariffs, could have a negative impact on our results of operations. Our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities, including government budgets, as well as to political and economic instability. International transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs in foreign countries. For example, as a condition of sale or award of a contract, some international customers require us to agree to offset arrangements, which may include in-country purchases, manufacturing and financial support arrangements. The contract may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements. In addition, as part of our globalization strategy, we have invested in certain countries, including Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Poland, Russia, South Africa, Turkey, Ukraine and countries in the Middle East and Central Asia, that carry high levels of currency, political, compliance and economic risk. We expect that sales to these and other emerging markets will continue to account for a significant portion of our sales as our businesses evolve and as these and other developing nations and regions around the world increase their demand for our products. Emerging market operations can present many risks, including cultural differences (such as employment and business practices), volatility in gross domestic product, economic and government instability, the imposition of exchange and capital controls, and the risks associated with exporting components manufactured in those countries for incorporation into finished products completed in other countries. While these factors and their impact are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Of note, in 2019 the U.S. Government suspended Turkey’s participation in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program because Turkey accepted delivery of the Russian-built S-400 air and missile defense system. The U.S. has imposed, and may impose additional, sanctions on Turkey as a result of this or other political disputes. Turkish companies supply components, some of which are sole-sourced, to our aerospace businesses for commercial and military engines and aerospace products. Depending upon the scope and timing of U.S. sanctions on Turkey and potential reciprocal actions, if any, such sanctions or actions could impact our aerospace businesses’ sources of supply and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. We Use a Variety of Raw Materials, Supplier-Provided Parts, Components, Sub-Systems and Contract Manufacturing Services in Our Businesses, and Significant Shortages, Supplier Capacity Constraints, Supplier Production 14 Disruptions or Price Increases Could Increase Our Operating Costs and Adversely Impact the Competitive Positions of Our Products. Our reliance on suppliers (including third-party manufacturing suppliers and logistics providers) and commodity markets to secure raw materials, parts, components and sub-systems used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials. In many instances, we depend upon a single source of supply, manufacturing, logistics support or assembly or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers. A disruption in deliveries from our suppliers, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions, supplier quality issues, closing or bankruptcy of our suppliers, price increases, or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. We believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. Nonetheless, price increases, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions or the unavailability of some raw materials may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. We May Not Complete the Separation Transactions or Complete Them Within the Time Frame We Anticipate; The Separation Transactions May Present Difficulties That Could Have an Adverse Effect on Us and/or the Independent Businesses Resulting from the Separation, and/or Costs Associated with the Separation Transactions May Be Higher Than Anticipated; The Independent Businesses May Underperform Relative to Our Expectations; We May Not Realize Some or All of the Expected Benefits of the Separation Transactions. In November 2018, we announced our intention to separate into three independent companies: (1) UTC, an aerospace company comprised of the Collins Aerospace Systems and Pratt & Whitney businesses, (2) Otis, and (3) Carrier. The proposed separations are expected to be effected through spin-offs by UTC of Otis and Carrier that are intended to be tax-free for the Company’s shareowners for U.S. federal income tax purposes. These separation transactions will be subject to UTC’s agreement to consummate the distributions pursuant to, and subject to the terms and conditions of, the Raytheon merger agreement discussed below, as well as the satisfaction of a number of customary conditions, including, among others, final approval by UTC’s Board of Directors, receipt of tax rulings and a tax opinion from external counsel, the filing with the SEC and effectiveness of Form 10 registration statements for Otis and Carrier and satisfactory completion of financing. Though UTC has agreed pursuant to, and subject to the terms and conditions of the Raytheon merger agreement, that UTC will consummate separation transactions, the failure to satisfy all of the required conditions could delay the completion of the separation transactions for a significant period of time or prevent them from occurring at all. Additionally, the separation transactions are complex in nature, and unanticipated developments or changes, including changes in law, the macroeconomic environment and market conditions or regulatory or political conditions may affect our ability to complete one or both of the separation transactions as currently expected, within the anticipated time frame or at all. Any changes to one or both of the separation transactions or delay in completing one or both of the separation transactions could cause us not to realize some or all of the expected benefits, or realize them on a different timeline than expected. In addition, the terms and conditions of the required regulatory authorizations and consents that are granted, if any, may impose requirements, limitations or costs, or place restrictions on the conduct of the independent companies or may materially delay the completion of one or both of the separation transactions. And, although we intend for the separation transactions to be tax-free to the Company’s shareowners for U.S. federal income tax purposes, there can be no assurance that the separation transactions will so qualify. If the separation transactions were ultimately determined to be taxable, we, the Company’s shareowners and/or the new independent companies would incur income tax liabilities that could be significant. Furthermore, if the separation transactions are completed, we cannot be assured that each separate company will be successful. Whether or not the separation transactions are completed, our businesses may face material challenges in connection with these transactions, including, without limitation: • the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business concerns and impact on the businesses of UTC (including Otis and Carrier) as a result of the devotion of management’s attention to the separation transactions; • maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees; • retaining existing business and operational relationships, including with customers, suppliers, employees and other counterparties, and attracting new business and operational relationships; • execution and related risks in connection with UTC, Otis and Carrier financing transactions undertaken in connection with the separation transactions; • foreseen and unforeseen dis-synergy costs, costs of restructuring transactions (including taxes) and other significant costs and expenses; and 15 • potential negative reactions from the financial markets if we fail to complete the separation transactions as currently expected, within the anticipated time frame or at all. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or the price of our common stock. In addition, if the separation transactions are completed, each of the separate companies will incur ongoing costs, including costs of operating as independent companies, that the separated businesses will no longer be able to share. Those costs may exceed our estimates or could diminish the benefits we expect to realize from the separation transactions. If the Separation Transactions Are Completed, UTC and the Independent Businesses’ Operational and Financial Profiles Will Change and Each Will Be a Less Diversified Company Than UTC as It Exists Today. The separation transactions will result in UTC, Otis and Carrier being less diversified companies with more limited businesses concentrated in their respective industries. Of note, even if the combination with Raytheon is completed, UTC’s businesses following the expected separation transactions will be significantly more reliant on three customers, namely Airbus, Boeing and the U.S. Government. As a result, each company may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the diversification of revenues, costs, and cash flows will diminish, such that each company’s results of operations, cash flows, working capital, effective tax rate, and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility and its ability to fund capital expenditures and investments, pay dividends and service debt may be diminished. It is anticipated that the effective tax rate for each separate company will differ from the UTC consolidated effective tax rate. If the Separation Transactions Are Completed, There May Be Changes in Our Shareowner Base, Which May Cause the Price of Our Common Stock To Fluctuate . Investors holding our common stock may hold our common stock because of a decision to invest in a company that operates in multiple markets with a diversified portfolio. If the separation transactions are completed, shares of our common stock will represent an investment in a business concentrated in the commercial aerospace and defense industry, and shares of the common stock of the new independent companies conducting the Otis and Carrier businesses will represent investments in businesses concentrated in their respective industries. These changes may not match some shareowners’ investment strategies, which could cause them to sell their shares of our common stock or the common stock of the new independent companies, and excessive selling pressure could cause the market price to decrease following the consummation of the separation transactions. Additionally, we cannot predict whether the market value of our common stock and the common stock of each of the new independent companies after the separation transactions will be, in the aggregate, less than, equal to or greater than the market value of our common stock prior to the separation transactions. We May Not Complete The Combination With Raytheon Or Complete The Combination Within The Time Frame We Anticipate; The Combined Business May Underperform Relative To Our Expectations; The Combination May Cause Our Financial Results To Differ From Our Expectations Or The Expectations Of The Investment Community; We May Not Be Able To Achieve Anticipated Cost Savings Or Other Anticipated Benefits. The completion of the combination with Raytheon is subject to a number of conditions. The failure to satisfy all of the required conditions could delay the completion of the combination for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring at all. Any delay in completing the combination could cause UTC not to realize some or all of the benefits that UTC expects to achieve if the combination is successfully completed within the expected timeframe, or could cause UTC to realize such benefits on a different timeline than expected. In addition, the terms and conditions of the required regulatory authorizations and consents for the combination that are granted, if any, may impose requirements, limitations or costs or place restrictions on the conduct of the combined company’s business or may materially delay the completion of the combination. Moreover, the completion of the combination is subject to, among other conditions, the completion of the spin-offs of Otis and Carrier, which are themselves subject to a number of conditions (subject to UTC’s agreement to consummate the distributions pursuant to, and subject to the terms and conditions of, the Raytheon merger agreement). Any delay in or prevention of the completion of the spin-offs could delay or prevent the completion of the combination. The success of the combination will depend, in part, on the combined company’s ability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses of UTC and Raytheon and realize the anticipated benefits, including synergies, cost savings, innovation opportunities and operational efficiencies, from the combination. If the combined company is unable to achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, and the value of the combined company’s common stock may decline. 16 The integration of the two companies may result in material challenges, including, without limitation: • managing larger combined aerospace systems and defense businesses; • maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees; • retaining existing business and operational relationships, including customers, suppliers and employees and other counterparties, as may be impacted by contracts containing consent and/or other provisions that may be triggered by the combination, and attracting new business and operational relationships; • the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process; • the possibility of significant costs involved in connection with completing the merger, including costs to achieve expected synergies; • consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations; • coordinating geographically separate organizations; • unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems; and • unforeseen expenses or delays associated with the combination. We Engage in Acquisitions and Divestitures, and May Encounter Difficulties Integrating Acquired Businesses with, or Disposing of Divested Businesses From, Our Current Operations; Therefore, We May Not Realize the Anticipated Benefits of these Acquisitions and Divestitures. We seek to grow through strategic acquisitions in addition to internal growth. In the past several years, we have made various acquisitions, including the acquisition of Rockwell Collins in November 2018, and have entered into joint ventures intended to complement and expand our businesses. We expect to continue to undertake such transactions in the future. Our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the material issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingencies of a particular transaction, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target’s previous activities. For example, we may incur unanticipated costs, expenses or other liabilities as a result of an acquisition target’s violation of applicable laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) or similar anti-bribery and corruption laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions. We also may incur unanticipated costs or expenses, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, litigation, and other liabilities. We also may encounter difficulties in integrating acquired businesses, including the Rockwell Collins businesses, with our operations, applying our internal controls processes to these acquired businesses, or in managing strategic investments. Additionally, we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, accounting requirements relating to business combinations, including the requirement to expense certain acquisition costs as incurred, may cause us to incur greater earnings volatility and generally lower earnings during periods in which we acquire new businesses. Furthermore, we make strategic divestitures from time to time. Our divestitures may result in continued financial exposure to the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements, continued supply and services arrangements, or potential litigation, following the transaction. Under these arrangements, nonperformance by those divested businesses could result in obligations being imposed on us that could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, cash flows, results of operations, or financial condition. The success of future acquisitions and divestitures will depend on the satisfaction of conditions precedent to, and consummation of, the pending transactions, the timing of consummation of these pending transactions, and the ability of the parties to secure any required regulatory approvals in a timely manner, among other things. We also enter into joint ventures in which we maintain significant influence, but do not control the businesses. Accordingly, our ability to apply our internal controls and compliance policies to these businesses is limited and can result in additional financial and reputational risks. Our Debt Levels and Related Debt Service Obligations Could Have Negative Consequences; Our Ability to Access Debt May Be Affected by Our Increased Indebtedness, Changes in Global Capital Markets, Our Financial Performance or Outlook, the Expected Separation Transactions or Our Credit Ratings. We have outstanding debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity. In connection with the Rockwell Collins acquisition, we issued $11 billion of aggregate principal notes and $7.8 billion of Rockwell Collins debt remained outstanding at the time of the closing of the acquisition. As expected, the completion of the acquisition resulted in a downgrade of UTC's long-term issuer credit ratings by one notch. Following the announcement of the expected separation transactions, one credit agency placed UTC's long-term issuer credit rating on negative outlook. The expected separation transactions and the increased indebtedness of UTC in connection with the Rockwell Collins acquisition may have the effect of, among other things: • requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt or the payment of costs associated with the separation transactions, which will reduce funds we have available 17 for other purposes, such as acquisitions, reinvestment in our businesses, dividends and repurchases of our common stock; • reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions; • exposing us to interest rate risk at the time the outstanding debt is refinanced or on the portion of our debt obligations that are issued at variable rates; and • further downgrades of our credit ratings resulting in increased borrowing costs. We depend, in part, upon the issuance of debt to fund our operations. If we require additional funding in order to fund outstanding financing commitments or meet other business requirements, our market liquidity may not be sufficient. A number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt, including disruptions or declines in the global capital markets and/or a decline in our financial performance, outlook or credit ratings. Quarterly Cash Dividends and Share Repurchases May Be Discontinued or Modified, Are Subject to a Number of Uncertainties and May Affect the Price of Our Common Stock. Quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases under our share repurchase program constitute components of our capital allocation strategy, which we fund with operating free cash flow, borrowings and divestitures. However, we are not required to declare dividends or make any share repurchases under our share repurchase program. Dividends and share repurchases may be discontinued, accelerated, suspended or delayed at any time without prior notice. Even if not discontinued, the amount of such dividends and repurchases may be changed, including in connection with the separation transactions and the Raytheon merger, and the amount, timing and frequency of such dividends and repurchases may vary from historical practice or from the company’s stated expectations. Decisions with respect to dividends and share repurchases are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be based on a variety of factors. Important factors that could cause us to discontinue, limit, suspend, increase or delay our quarterly cash dividends or share repurchases include market conditions, the price of our common stock, the nature and timing of other investment opportunities, changes in our business strategy, the terms of our financing arrangements, our outlook as to the ability to obtain financing at attractive rates, the impact on our credit ratings and the availability of domestic cash. To help manage the cash flow and liquidity impact resulting from the Rockwell Collins acquisition and the proposed separation transactions, we have limited our share repurchases.Our ability to repurchase shares is also restricted by the Raytheon merger agreement. The reduction or elimination of our cash dividend or share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Additionally, there can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance shareholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock. Although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term shareholder value, short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program's effectiveness. See Item 5, ""Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities"" in this Form 10-K for a description of our share repurchase program and past share repurchases. We Design, Manufacture and Service Products that Incorporate Advanced Technologies; The Introduction of New Products and Technologies Involves Risks and We May Not Realize the Degree or Timing of Benefits Initially Anticipated. We seek to achieve growth through the design, development, production, sale and support of innovative products that incorporate advanced technologies. The product, program and service needs of our customers change and evolve regularly, and we invest substantial amounts in research and development efforts to pursue advancements in a wide range of technologies, products and services. Of particular note, Pratt & Whitney is currently producing and delivering the PW1000G Geared Turbofan engine to power various aircraft, including the A320neo family of aircraft. The level of orders received for the Geared Turbofan family of engines coupled with a requirement to achieve mature production levels in a very short time frame require significant additional manufacturing and supply chain capacity. If any of our production ramp-up efforts are delayed, if suppliers cannot timely deliver or perform to our standards, and/or if we identify or experience issues with in-service engines, we may not meet customers’ delivery schedules, which could result in material additional costs, including liquidated damages or other liabilities that could be assessed under existing contracts. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our technological advancements depends on a variety of factors, including meeting development, production, certification and regulatory approval schedules; execution of internal and external performance plans; availability of supplier and internally produced parts and materials; performance of suppliers and subcontractors; availability of supplier and internal facility capacity to perform maintenance, repair and overhaul services on our products; hiring and training of qualified personnel; achieving cost and production efficiencies; identification of emerging technological trends in our target end-markets; validation of innovative technologies; the level 18 of customer interest in new technologies and products; and customer acceptance of products we manufacture or that incorporate technologies we develop. For example, our customers manufacture end products and larger aerospace systems that incorporate certain of our aerospace products. These systems and end products may also incorporate additional technologies manufactured by third parties and involve additional risks and uncertainties. As a result, the performance and market acceptance of these larger systems and end products could affect the level of customer interest and acceptance of our products in the marketplace. Development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses, and these efforts may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings. In addition, the markets for our products or products that incorporate our technologies may not develop or grow as we anticipate. We or our customers, suppliers or subcontractors may encounter difficulties in developing and producing new products and services, and may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated or may otherwise suffer significant adverse financial consequences. Due to the design complexity of our products or those of our customers or third party manufacturers that incorporate our products into theirs or our customers products, we may experience delays in completing the development and introduction of new products or we may experience the suspension of production after these products enter into service due to safety concerns. Delays and/or suspension of production could result in increased development costs or deflect resources from other projects. In particular, we cannot predict with certainty whether, when and in what quantities our aerospace businesses will produce and sell aircraft engines, aircraft systems and components and other products currently in development, pending required certifications or after entry into service. Our contracts are typically awarded on a competitive basis. Our bids are based upon, among other items, the cost to provide the products and services. To generate an acceptable return on our investment in these contracts, we must be able to accurately estimate our costs to provide the services and deliver the products and to be able to complete the contracts in a timely manner. If we fail to accurately estimate our costs or the time required to complete a contract, the profitability of our contracts may be materially and adversely affected. Some of our contracts provide for liquidated damages in the event that we are unable to perform and deliver in accordance with the contractual specifications and schedule. In addition, we may face customer directed cost reduction targets that could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our contracts if theses targets are not achieved when required. Furthermore, our competitors, including our customers, may develop competing technologies which gain market acceptance in advance of or instead of our products. The possibility also exists that our competitors or customers might develop new technologies or offerings that might cause our existing technologies and offerings to become obsolete. In addition, the possibility exists that competitors or customers will develop aftermarket services and aftermarket parts for our products which attract customers and adversely impact our return on investment on new products. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Our Business May Be Affected by Government Contracting Risks. Most of our contracts with the U.S. Government are fixed price, which subjects us to the risk of reduced margins or losses if we are unable to achieve estimated costs, performance improvements, or efficiencies. U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for convenience or for default. If terminated for convenience, we generally would be entitled to recover payment for work completed and certain termination costs. If terminated for default, the government would pay only for the work that has been accepted and could require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the undelivered goods or services from another source as well as other damages resulting from the default. We are now, and believe that in light of the current U.S. Government contracting environment we will continue to be, the subject of U.S. Government investigations relating to our U.S. Government contracts. Such U.S. Government investigations often take years to complete and could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, including repayments, fines, treble and other damages, forfeitures, restitution or penalties, or could lead to suspension or debarment of U.S. Government contracting or of export privileges. For instance, if we or one of our business units were charged with wrongdoing in connection with a U.S. Government investigation (including fraud, or violation of certain environmental or export laws, as further described below), the U.S. Government could suspend us from bidding on or receiving awards of new U.S. Government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings. If convicted or found liable, the U.S. Government could fine and debar us from new U.S. Government contracting for a period generally not to exceed three years and could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud. We also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, even if such allegations are later determined to be unsubstantiated. 19 Like many defense contractors, our contracts with the U.S. Government are subject to audit and we have received audit reports recommending the reduction of certain contract prices because, for example, cost or pricing data or cost accounting practices used to price and negotiate those contracts may not have conformed to government regulations. Some of these audit reports recommend that certain payments be repaid, delayed, or withheld, and may involve substantial amounts, which could, if the audit reports’ theories were to prevail in litigation, increase the costs absorbed by our commercial engine business in the future. We have made voluntary refunds in those cases we believe appropriate, have settled some allegations and, in some cases, continue to negotiate and/or litigate. The Company may be, and has been, required to make payments into escrow of disputed liabilities while the related litigation is pending. If the litigation is resolved in the Company’s favor, any such payments will be returned to the Company with interest. Exports of Certain of Our Products Are Subject to Various Export Control and Sanctions Regulations and May Require Authorization From the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Department of the Treasury or Regulatory Agencies of Other Countries. We must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the export of products, services and technology from the U.S. and other countries having jurisdiction over our operations. In the U.S., these laws include, among others, the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) administered by the U.S. Department of State and embargoes and sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Certain of our products, services and technologies have military or strategic applications and are on the U.S. Munitions List of the ITAR and the Commerce Control List of the EAR, or are otherwise subject to the EAR. In addition, U.S. foreign policy may restrict or prohibit our ability to engage in business dealings with certain individuals, entities or countries. As a result, our ability to export our products or services to certain countries or for particular end-uses or end-users may require authorization. Any failure by us or our customers or suppliers to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal penalties, fines, seizure of our products, adverse publicity, restrictions on our ability to export our products, or the suspension or debarment from doing business with the U.S. Government. Moreover, any changes in export control or sanctions regulations may further restrict the export of our products or services, and the possibility of such changes requires constant monitoring to ensure we remain compliant. The length of time required by the licensing processes can vary, potentially delaying the shipment of products or performance of services and the recognition of the corresponding revenue. Any restrictions on the export of our products or product lines could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. We Are Subject to Litigation, Environmental, Product Safety, Anti-Corruption and Other Legal and Compliance Risks. We are subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks. These risks relate to, among other things, product safety, personal injuries, intellectual property rights, contract-related claims, government contracts, taxes, environmental matters, competition laws and laws governing improper business practices. We or one of our businesses could be charged with wrongdoing as a result of such matters. If convicted or found liable, we could be subject to significant fines, penalties, repayments, or other damages (in certain cases, treble damages). As a global business, we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the U.S. and in other countries in which we operate. Those laws and regulations may be interpreted in different ways. They may also change from time to time, as may related interpretations and other guidance. Changes in laws or regulations could result in higher expenses. Uncertainty relating to laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights. Changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures. Changes in climate change concerns, or in the regulation of such concerns, including greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw materials costs. Climate-related events also could disrupt our businesses and require us to incur additional costs. At times we are involved in disputes with private parties over environmental issues, including litigation over the allocation of cleanup costs, alleged personal injuries and alleged property damage. Personal injury lawsuits may involve individual and purported class actions alleging that contaminants originating from our current or former products or operating facilities caused or contributed to medical conditions, including cancers incurred by employees, former employees, third-parties' employees or residents in the area, and environmental damage or diminution of real estate values. Even in litigation where we believe our liability is remote, there is a risk that a negative finding or decision in a matter involving multiple plaintiffs or a purported class action could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, in particular with respect to environmental claims in regions where we have, or previously had, significant operations. 20 Product recalls and product liability claims (including claims related to the safety or reliability of our products) also can result in significant costs, including fines, as well as negative publicity, management distraction and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services. In addition, the FCPA and other anti-bribery and corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA applies to companies, individual directors, officers, employees and agents. U.S. companies also may be held liable for actions taken by strategic or local partners or representatives. The FCPA also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded U.S. corporations and their foreign affiliates, which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments. Certain of our customer relationships outside of the U.S. are with governmental entities and are therefore subject to the FCPA and other anti-bribery and corruption laws. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery and corruption laws. Despite meaningful measures that we undertake to ensure lawful conduct, which include training and internal control policies, these measures may not always prevent violations of the FCPA or similar laws. We previously have been subject to regulatory investigations for alleged violations of anti-bribery laws, and could be subject to such investigations in the future, which could result in criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement, further changes or enhancements to our procedures, policies and controls, personnel changes or other remedial actions. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our operations, cause reputational harm, involve significant management distraction and result in a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Cybersecurity and data privacy and protection laws and regulations are evolving and present increasing compliance challenges, which increase our costs, may affect our competitiveness, cause reputational harm, and expose us to substantial fines or other penalties. For a description of current material legal proceedings and regulatory matters, see ""Legal Proceedings"" in in this Form 10-K and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2019 Annual Report. Additional Tax Expense or Additional Tax Exposures Could Affect Our Future Profitability. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and various international jurisdictions. Changes in tax laws and regulations, as well as changes and conflicts in related interpretations and other tax guidance could materially impact our tax receivables and liabilities and our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business we are subject to examinations by various tax authorities. In addition to ongoing examinations, there could be additional examinations launched in the future by governmental authorities in various jurisdictions, and existing examinations could be expanded. The global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional examinations, proceedings and contingencies will arise from time to time. Our competitive position, cash flows, results of operation or financial condition may be affected by the outcome of examinations, proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty. See ""Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" under the headings ""Business Overview, """"Results of Operations - Income Taxes,"" and ""Liquidity and Financial Condition"" and Notes 1 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2019 Annual Report for further discussion on income taxes and related contingencies, including our accounting and assessment of the effect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ( TCJA). Our Defined Benefit Pension Plans are Subject to Financial Market Risk that Could Adversely Affect Our Results. The performance of the financial markets and interest rates can impact our defined benefit pension plan expenses and funding obligations. Significant decreases in the discount rate or investment losses on plan assets may increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our financial results. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2019 Annual Report for further discussion on pension plans and related obligations and contingencies. We May Be Unable to Realize Expected Benefits From Our Cost Reduction and Restructuring Efforts and Our Profitability May Be Hurt or Our Business Otherwise Might Be Adversely Affected. In order to operate more efficiently and control costs, we announce from time to time restructuring plans, which include workforce reductions, global facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives. These plans are intended to generate operating expense savings through reductions in direct and indirect expenses as well as improved efficiencies. We may undertake further workforce reductions or restructuring actions in the future. These types of cost reduction and restructuring activities are complex. If we do not successfully manage our current restructuring activities, or any future restructuring activities, expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized, and our operations and business could be disrupted. Risks associated with these actions and other workforce management issues include unfavorable political responses to such actions, unforeseen delays in the implementation of anticipated workforce 21 reductions, additional unexpected costs, adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees or work stoppages, any of which may impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions, or otherwise harm our business, or have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Our Business and Financial Performance May Be Adversely Affected By Cyber-attacks on Information Technology Infrastructure and Products and Other Business Disruptions Our business may be impacted by disruptions to our own or third-party information technology (IT) infrastructure, which could result from (among other causes) cyber-attacks on or failures of such infrastructure or compromises to its physical security, as well as from damaging weather or other acts of nature. Cyber-based risks, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, both attacks on our IT infrastructure and attacks on the IT infrastructure of third parties (both on premises and in the cloud) attempting to gain unauthorized access to our confidential or other proprietary information, classified information, or information relating to our employees, customers and other third parties. Cyber-based risks could also include attacks targeting the security, integrity and/or availability of the hardware, software and information installed, stored or transmitted in our products, including after the purchase of those products and when they are incorporated into third-party products, facilities or infrastructure. Such attacks could disrupt our systems or those of third parties, impact business operations, result in unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, and corrupt our data or that of third parties. We have experienced cyber-based attacks, and due to the evolving threat landscape, may continue to experience them going forward, potentially with more frequency. The threats we face vary from attacks common to most industries to more advanced and persistent, highly organized adversaries, including nation states, which target us and other defense contractors. We continue to make investments and adopt measures designed to enhance our protection, detection, response, and recovery capabilities, and to mitigate potential risks to our technology, products, services and operations from potential cyber-attacks. However, given the unpredictability, nature and scope of cyber-attacks, it is possible that potential vulnerabilities could go undetected for an extended period. We could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromise of confidential or otherwise protected information, misappropriation, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our or third-party systems, networks or products, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business, or potential liability, penalties, fines and/or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Due to the evolving nature of such risks, the impact of any potential incident cannot be predicted. We Depend On Our Intellectual Property, and Have Access to Certain Intellectual Property and Information of Our Customers and Suppliers; Infringement or Failure to Protect Our Intellectual Property Could Adversely Affect Our Future Growth and Success. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements, information technology security systems, internal controls and compliance systems and other measures to protect our intellectual property. We also rely on nondisclosure agreements, information technology security systems and other measures to protect certain customer and supplier information and intellectual property that we have in our possession or to which we have access. Our efforts to protect intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient. We cannot be sure that our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents to us, that patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to preclude our competitors from introducing technologies similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the U.S. In addition, we may be the target of competitor or other third-party patent enforcement actions seeking substantial monetary damages or seeking to prevent our sale and marketing of certain of our products or services. Our competitive position also may be adversely impacted by limitations on our ability to obtain possession of, and ownership or necessary licenses concerning, data important to the development or provision of our products or service offerings, or by limitations on our ability to restrict the use by others of data related to our products or services. We may also be subject to disruptions, losses and liability resulting from various cybersecurity attacks or information technology failures, as described above. Any of these events or factors could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, subject us to judgments, penalties and significant litigation costs or temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. 22 Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 2. Properties We have properties in approximately 97 countries, with over 650 significant properties comprising approximately 96 million square feet of productive space. Approximately 57% of our significant properties are associated with our aerospace businesses and 43% are associated with our commercial businesses. Approximately 48% of our significant properties are leased, and 52% are owned. Approximately 51% of our significant properties are located in the United States. Our fixed assets as of December 31, 2019 include manufacturing facilities and non-manufacturing facilities such as warehouses, and a substantial quantity of machinery and equipment, most of which are general purpose machinery and equipment using special jigs, tools and fixtures and in many instances having automatic control features and special adaptations. The facilities, warehouses, machinery and equipment in use as of December 31, 2019 are in good operating condition, are well-maintained and substantially all are generally in regular use. 23 Item 3. Legal Proceedings Federal Securities Laws Litigation On January 2, 2018, a purported shareowner filed a second amended complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the ""District Court"") under the federal securities laws against the Company and certain of its current and former executives ( Frankfurt-Trust Investment Luxemburg AG v. United Technologies Corporation et al.), which further amends a previously disclosed complaint that was filed on May 10, 2017 . In the second amended complaint, the plaintiff purports to represent a class of shareowners who purchased the Company’s stock between December 11, 2014 and July 20, 2015. The second amended complaint alleges violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, related to alleged false and misleading statements and omissions of material fact made in connection with the Company’s 2015 earnings expectations. On September 28, 2018, the District Court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss the case in its entirety. On October 25, 2018, the plaintiff filed a Notice of Appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (the ""Court of Appeals""). On October 15, 2019, the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's decision. The plaintiff’s deadline to file a petition for certiorari to the U.S. Supreme Court has expired, and the matter is now closed. 737 MAX Aircraft Litigation Multiple lawsuits have been filed in U.S. courts relating to the October 29, 2018 Lion Air Flight 610 and the March 10, 2019 Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 accidents. Collins Aerospace sold certain aircraft parts and systems to The Boeing Company for the 737 MAX aircraft involved in these accidents. Certain of our Collins Aerospace businesses have been named, along with other third parties, as parties in many of these lawsuits. We are also fully supporting all ongoing governmental investigations and inquiries relating to the accidents. We do not expect that the lawsuits or governmental investigations or inquiries will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Rockwell Collins' Voluntary Disclosure In 2018, and before its acquisition by UTC, Rockwell Collins voluntarily disclosed to the United States Department of Justice (the ""DOJ"") and the SEC Division of Enforcement that it was conducting an internal investigation regarding meal, entertainment, and gift expenditures of B/E Aerospace sales employees that may not have complied with then-applicable company policy, as well as a potential conflict of interest involving a third party sales agent for B/E Aerospace in China. The internal investigation resulted from Rockwell Collins’ post-acquisition compliance review of B/E Aerospace. On December 16, 2019, and January 16, 2020, the DOJ and SEC, respectively, notified UTC that they have closed their investigations of this matter. In addition, we are subject to a number of other lawsuits, investigations and claims (some of which involve substantial amounts). For a discussion of contingencies related to certain other legal proceedings, see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2019 Annual Report. Except as indicated herein or in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2019 Annual Report, we do not believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect upon our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. A further discussion of government contracts and related investigations, as well as a discussion of our environmental liabilities, can be found under the heading ""Other Matters Relating to Our Business as a Whole – Compliance with Environmental and Other Government Regulations"" in Item 1, ""Business,"" and in Item 1A, ""Risk Factors,"" in this Form 10-K. 24 Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. PART II Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities UTC’s common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “UTX.” There were approximately 30,010 registered shareholders at January 31, 2020.

Controls and Procedures As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), the Acting Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and the Corporate Vice President, Controller (Controller), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Based upon our evaluation, our CEO, CFO and Controller concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO, CFO and Controller, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Our management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019. In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in its 2013 Internal Control – Integrated Framework. Our management has concluded that based on its assessment, our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2019. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which appears in our 2019 Annual Report.

The Company is filing this amendment for the sole purpose of including the information required by Item 201(d) of Regulation S-K in Part III, Item 12, which information had been inadvertently omitted from the Form 10-K.

Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters The information required by Item 12 relating to security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management is incorporated herein by reference to the section of our Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareowners titled ""Share Ownership"". Equity Compensation Plan Information The following table provides information as of December 31, 2018 concerning Common Stock issuable under UTC’s equity compensation plans. Plan category Number of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants and rights (a) Weighted-average exercise price of outstanding options, warrants and rights (b) Number of securities remaining available for future issuance under equity compensation plans (excluding securities reflected in column (a)) (c) Equity compensation plans approved by shareowners 9,690,000 (1) $ 99.12 57,752,000 (3) Equity compensation plans not approved by shareowners 336,000 (2 ) N/A N/A (1) Consists of the following issuable shares of Common Stock awarded under the United Technologies Corporation 2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2018 LTIP”) and the United Technologies Corporation Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended (together with the 2018 LTIP, the “LTIPs”): (i) shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding non-qualified stock options; (ii) shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs); (iii) shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to outstanding restricted stock unit and performance share unit awards, assuming performance at the target level (up to an additional 1,143,000 shares of Common Stock could be issued if performance goals are achieved above target), except for the 2016 performance share unit awards which reflect actual performance achieved; and (iv) shares of Common Stock issuable upon the settlement of outstanding deferred stock units and restricted stock units awarded under the United Technologies Corporation Board of Directors Deferred Stock Unit Plan, as amended and restated effective April 24, 2017. Under the LTIPs, each SAR referred to in clause (ii) is exercisable for a number of shares of Common Stock having a value equal to the increase in the market price of a share of such stock from the date the SAR was granted. For purposes of determining the total number of shares to be issued in respect of outstanding SARs as reflected in column (a) above, we have used the NYSE closing price for a share of Common Stock on December 31, 2018 of $106.48. The weighted-average exercise price of outstanding options, warrants and rights shown in column (b) takes into account only the shares identified in clauses (i) and (ii).

(3) Represents the maximum number of shares of Common Stock available to be awarded under the 2018 LTIP as of December 31, 2018. Performance share units and restricted stock units (Full Share Awards) will result in a reduction in the number of shares of Common Stock available for delivery under the 2018 LTIP in an amount equal to 4.03 times the number of shares to which the award corresponds. Stock options and stock appreciation rights do not constitute Full Share Awards and will result in a reduction in the number of shares of Common Stock available for delivery under the 2018 LTIP on a one-for-one basis.

Business General United Technologies Corporation was incorporated in Delaware in 1934. UTC provides high technology products and services to the building systems and aerospace industries worldwide. Growth is attributable primarily to the internal development of our existing businesses and to acquisitions. The following description of our business should be read in conjunction with ""Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" in our 2018 Annual Report, including the information contained therein under the heading ""Business Overview."" Our operations for the periods presented herein are classified into four segments: Otis, Carrier (formerly known as UTC Climate, Controls & Security), Pratt & Whitney, and Collins Aerospace Systems (a new segment comprised of the former UTC Aerospace Systems segment and the Rockwell Collins businesses following UTC's acquisition of Rockwell Collins, Inc. in November 2018), with each segment comprised of groups of similar operating companies. References to each segment include the various operating companies established worldwide through which the operations for each segment are conducted. Otis and Carrier (collectively referred to as the ""commercial businesses"") serve customers in the commercial, government, infrastructure and residential property sectors and refrigeration and transport sectors worldwide. Pratt & Whitney and Collins Aerospace Systems (collectively referred to as the ""aerospace businesses"") primarily serve commercial and government customers in both the original equipment and aftermarket parts and services markets of the aerospace industry. For 2018 , our commercial and industrial sales (generated principally by the commercial businesses) were approximately 47 percent of our consolidated sales, and our commercial aerospace sales and military aerospace sales (generated exclusively by our aerospace businesses) were approximately 39 percent and 14 percent, respectively, of our consolidated sales. International sales for 2018 , including U.S. export sales, were 62 percent of our net sales. On November 26, 2018, the Company announced its intention to separate into three independent companies: (1) UTC, an aerospace company comprised of the Collins Aerospace Systems and Pratt & Whitney businesses, (2) Otis, and (3) Carrier. The proposed separations are expected to be effected through spin-offs by UTC of Otis and Carrier that are intended to be tax-free for the Company’s shareowners for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Company expects to complete the separation transactions by mid-year 2020. Separation of Otis and Carrier from UTC via spin-off transactions will be subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including, among others, final approval by the Company’s Board of Directors, receipt of tax rulings in certain jurisdictions and/or a tax opinion from external counsel (as applicable), the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and effectiveness of Form 10 registration statements, and satisfactory completion of financing. This Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports are available free of charge through the Investor Relations section of our Internet website (http://www.utc.com) under the heading ""SEC Filings"" as soon as reasonably practicable after these reports are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. In addition, the SEC maintains an Internet site (http://www.sec.gov) containing reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. 3 Table of Contents Description of Business by Segment Each segment's business, including its principal products and services and other material developments and information, is described below. Segment financial data for the years 2016 through 2018 , including financial information about foreign and domestic operations and export sales, appears in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2018 Annual Report. Segment sales as discussed below include intercompany sales, which are ultimately eliminated within the ""Eliminations and other"" category as reflected in the segment financial data in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2018 Annual Report. Similarly, total segment backlog as discussed below includes intercompany backlog. Beginning in 2018, for each of our segments, we have elected to quantify backlog in a manner that is consistent with the definition of remaining performance obligation (RPO) under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606: Revenue from Contracts with Customers . This change did not result in a material impact to the RPO balances of Otis, Carrier or Collins Aerospace Systems. However, as described below, Pratt & Whitney's RPO was adjusted to exclude airline engine orders previously included in backlog for which we have not received the associated firm manufacturing purchase orders. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2018 Annual Report for further discussion of the accounting for RPO under ASC Topic 606: Revenue from Contracts with Customers . Otis Otis is the world’s largest elevator and escalator manufacturing, installation and service company. Otis designs, manufactures, sells and installs a wide range of passenger and freight elevators as well as escalators and moving walkways. In addition to new equipment, Otis provides modernization products to upgrade elevators and escalators as well as maintenance and repair services for both its products and those of other manufacturers. Otis serves customers in the commercial, residential and infrastructure property sectors around the world. Otis sells direct and through sales representatives and distributors. Sales generated by Otis’ international operations was 73 percent of total Otis net sales in both 2018 and 2017 . At December 31, 2018 , Otis’ RPO was $16.4 billion as compared to a backlog of $16.2 billion at December 31, 2017 . Of the total Otis RPO at December 31, 2018 , approximately $8.8 billion is expected to be realized as sales in 2019 . Carrier Carrier is a leading provider of heating, ventilating, air conditioning (HVAC), refrigeration, fire, security, and building automation products, solutions, and services for commercial, government, infrastructure, and residential property applications and refrigeration and transportation applications. Carrier provides a wide range of building systems, including cooling, heating, ventilation, refrigeration, fire, flame, gas, and smoke detection, portable fire extinguishers, fire suppression, intruder alarms, access control systems, video surveillance, and building control systems. Carrier also provides a broad array of related building services, including audit, design, installation, system integration, repair, maintenance, and monitoring services. Carrier also provides refrigeration and monitoring products and solutions to the transport industry. Carrier sells its HVAC and refrigeration products and solutions either directly, including to building contractors and owners, transportation companies, retail stores and food service companies, or indirectly through joint ventures, independent sales representatives, distributors, wholesalers, dealers, and retail outlets. These products and services are sold under the Carrier name and other brand names. Carrier’s security and fire safety products and services are used by governments, financial institutions, architects, building owners and developers, security, and fire consultants, homeowners, and other end-users requiring a high level of security and fire protection for their businesses and residences. Carrier provides its security and fire safety products and services under Chubb, Kidde and other brand names, and sells directly to customers as well as through manufacturer's representatives, distributors, dealers, value-added resellers and retail distribution. Certain Carrier HVAC businesses are seasonal, and sales and service activity can be impacted by weather. Carrier customarily offers its customers incentives to purchase products to ensure an adequate supply of its products in the distribution channels. The principal incentive program provides reimbursements to distributors for offering promotional pricing and contract terms on Carrier products. Sales generated by Carrier’s international operations, including U.S. export sales, were 54 percent and 55 percent of total Carrier net sales in 2018 and 2017 , respectively. At December 31, 2018 , Carrier’s RPO was $5.3 billion as compared to a backlog of $4.4 billion at December 31, 2017 . Of the total Carrier RPO at December 31, 2018, approximately 70% is expected to be realized as sales in 2019. 4 Table of Contents Pratt & Whitney Pratt & Whitney is among the world’s leading suppliers of aircraft engines for the commercial, military, business jet and general aviation markets. Pratt & Whitney provides fleet management services and aftermarket maintenance, repair and overhaul services. Pratt & Whitney designs, develops, produces and maintains families of large engines for wide- and narrow-body and large regional aircraft in the commercial market and for fighter, bomber, tanker and transport aircraft in the military market. Pratt & Whitney Canada (P&WC) is among the world's leading suppliers of engines powering general and business aviation, as well as regional airline, and utility airplanes, and helicopters. Pratt & Whitney and P&WC also produce, sell and service auxiliary power units for military and commercial aircraft. The development of new engines and improvements to current production engines present important growth opportunities. In view of the risks and costs associated with developing new engines, Pratt & Whitney has entered into collaboration arrangements in which revenues, costs and risks are shared with third parties. At December 31, 2018 , the interests of third-party participants in Pratt & Whitney-directed commercial jet engine programs ranged from approximately 13 percent to 50 percent. UTC holds a 61 percent program share interest in the IAE International Aero Engines AG (IAE) collaboration with MTU Aero Engines AG (MTU) and Japanese Aero Engines Corporation (JAEC). Pratt & Whitney also holds a 59 percent program share interest in the International Aero Engines, LLC (IAE LLC) collaboration with MTU and JAEC. Pratt & Whitney sells the PW1100G-JM engine for the Airbus A320neo aircraft and the PW1400G-JM engine for the Irkut MC-21 aircraft through IAE LLC. In addition, Pratt & Whitney has interests in other engine programs, including a 50 percent ownership interest in the Engine Alliance (EA), a joint venture with GE Aviation, which markets and manufactures the GP7000 engine for the Airbus A380 aircraft. Pratt & Whitney has entered into risk and revenue sharing arrangements with third parties for 40 percent of the products and 25 percent of the services that Pratt & Whitney is responsible for providing to the EA. Pratt & Whitney accounts for its interest in the EA joint venture under the equity method of accounting. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2018 Annual Report for a description of our accounting for collaborative arrangements. Pratt & Whitney produces the PurePower PW1000G Geared Turbofan engine family, the first of which, the PW1100G-JM, entered into service in January 2016. The PurePower PW1000G engine has demonstrated a significant reduction in fuel burn and noise levels and lower environmental emissions when compared to legacy engines. The PW1100G-JM engine is offered on the Airbus A320neo family of aircraft. PurePower PW1000G engine models also power the Airbus A220 passenger aircraft and Embraer’s E-Jet E2 family of aircraft. Additionally, the PurePower PW1000G engine models have been selected to power the new Mitsubishi Regional Jet, and the new Irkut MC-21 passenger aircraft, which are both scheduled to enter service in 2020. As previously disclosed, Gulfstream announced the selection of the PurePower PW800 engine to exclusively power Gulfstream’s new G500 and G600 business jets. The Gulfstream G500 entered service in 2018, and the Gulfstream G600 is scheduled to enter service in 2019. P&WC's PurePower PW800 engine has also been selected to power the new Falcon 6X business jet by Dassault Aviation, which is scheduled to enter into service in 2022. Pratt & Whitney continues to enhance its programs through performance improvement measures and product base expansion. The success of these aircraft and engines is dependent upon many factors, including technological accomplishments, program execution, aircraft demand, and regulatory approval. As a result of these factors, as well as the level of success of aircraft program launches by aircraft manufacturers and other conditions, additional investment in these engine programs may be required. Pratt & Whitney is under contract with the U.S. Government's F-35 Joint Program Office to produce and sustain the F135 engine to power the single-engine F-35 Lightning II aircraft (commonly known as the Joint Strike Fighter) being produced by Lockheed Martin. The two F135 propulsion system configurations for the F-35A, F-35B and F-35C jets are used by the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Navy, respectively. F135 engines are also used on F-35 aircraft purchased by Joint Strike Fighter partner countries and foreign military sales countries. Pratt & Whitney is also under contract to build engines for the U.S. Air Force’s B-21 long-range strike bomber and for the development of next-generation adaptive engines for the U.S. Air Force. Pratt & Whitney’s products are sold principally to aircraft manufacturers, airlines and other aircraft operators, aircraft leasing companies and the U.S. and foreign governments. Pratt & Whitney’s products and services must adhere to strict regulatory and market-driven safety and performance standards. The frequently changing nature of these standards, along with the long duration of aircraft engine development, production and support programs, creates uncertainty regarding engine program profitability. Sales to Airbus (Pratt & Whitney’s largest customer by sales) were 36 percent and 38 percent of total Pratt & Whitney segment sales in 2018 and 2017 , respectively, before taking into account discounts or financial incentives offered to customers. Sales to the U.S. Government were approximately 23 percent and 21 percent of total Pratt & Whitney segment sales in 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Sales generated by Pratt & Whitney’s international operations, including U.S. export sales, were 63 percent and 61 percent of total Pratt & Whitney net sales in 2018 and 2017 , respectively. At December 31, 2018 , Pratt & Whitney’s RPO was $71.1 billion, including $10.0 billion of U.S. Government contracts and subcontracts. At December 31, 2017 , Pratt & 5 Table of Contents Whitney's backlog was $64.3 billion, including $6.0 billion of U.S. Government contracts and subcontracts. As noted above, in conjunction with our adoption of ASC Topic 606: Revenue from Contracts with Customers, we have elected to quantify backlog in a manner that is consistent with the definition of RPO. In prior years, backlog included engine orders from airlines, for which the contractual manufacturing purchase orders had not yet been received from the applicable airframe customers. Effective with the adoption of ASC Topic 606, we no longer include in backlog airline engine orders for which we have not received the associated firm manufacturing purchase orders. The decline in Pratt & Whitney’s RPO at December 31, 2018 as a result of this change has been more than offset by other order activity during the year. Of the total Pratt & Whitney RPO at December 31, 2018 , approximately $10.9 billion is expected to be realized as sales in 2019 . Pratt & Whitney’s RPO includes certain contracts for which actual costs may ultimately exceed total sales. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2018 Annual Report for a description of our Revenue Recognition accounting policy which includes discussion of the accounting for long-term contracts and Note 3 for further discussion on RPO under ASC Topic 606: Revenue from Contracts with Customers . Collins Aerospace Systems On November 26, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of Rockwell Collins pursuant to the merger agreement dated September 4, 2017. As a result of the acquisition, Rockwell Collins became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and was combined with the legacy UTC Aerospace Systems business segment to form a new business segment, Collins Aerospace Systems. Rockwell Collins' results of operations have been included in UTC’s financial statements for the period subsequent to the completion of the acquisition on November 26, 2018. Collins Aerospace Systems is a leading global provider of technologically advanced aerospace products and aftermarket service solutions for aircraft manufacturers, airlines, regional, business and general aviation markets, military, space and undersea operations.

Collins Aerospace Systems sells aerospace products and services to aircraft manufacturers, airlines and other aircraft operators, the U.S. and foreign governments, maintenance, repair and overhaul providers, and independent distributors. Collins Aerospace Systems’ largest customers are Boeing and Airbus with a combined 31 percent and 33 percent of total Collins Aerospace Systems segment sales in 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Sales to the U.S. Government were 19 percent and 17 percent of total Collins Aerospace Systems net sales in 2018 and 2017 , respectively. In 2018, Collins Aerospace Systems’ products supported the first flight of the Airbus Beluga XL, as well as the certifications of the Embraer E190-E2, Bombardier Global 7500, and Challenger 604. Collins Aerospace Systems also supported the United States Army’s HMS (Handheld, Manpack, and Small Form Fit) Manpack and the United States Air Force’s T-1A Jayhawk and ACES 5 ejection seat certifications. On-going certification efforts include the Embraer E195-E2 and KC390, as well as the Boeing KC-46 and COMAC C919. Collins Aerospace Systems’ products supported the 2018 entry into service for the Airbus A350-1000 and A330neo, Boeing 787-10, Embraer E190-E2, Gulfstream G500, as well as the Bombardier Global 7500. Significant product development activity continues, including major systems for the COMAC CR929, Boeing 777X and T-X Trainer, Mitsubishi Regional Jet, KAI (Korea Aerospace Industries) KF-X Fighter Jet, Embraer Praetor 500 and 600, Iridium NEXT, next generation flight deck technologies, Tactical Combat Training Systems Increment II, and the United States Air Force’s Modernized GPS User Equipment Program. Collins Aerospace Systems is also the operations support prime contractor for NASA’s space suit/life support system, and produces environmental monitoring and control, life support, power management and distribution, and thermal control systems for the International Space Station and the Orion crew exploration vehicle. Sales generated by Collins Aerospace Systems’ international operations, including U.S. export sales, was 56 percent of total Collins Aerospace Systems segment sales in both 2018 and 2017 . At December 31, 2018 , Collins Aerospace Systems’ 6 Table of Contents RPO was $26.6 billion, including $6.0 billion of U.S. Government contracts and subcontracts, and $10.7 billion of RPO related to the acquisition of Rockwell Collins. At December 31, 2017 , backlog was $13.9 billion, including $3.0 billion of U.S. Government contracts and subcontracts. Of the total Collins Aerospace Systems RPO at December 31, 2018 , approximately $12.3 billion is expected to be realized as sales in 2019 . See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2018 Annual Report for a description of our Revenue Recognition accounting policy which includes discussion of the accounting for long-term contracts and Note 3 for further discussion on RPO under ASC Topic 606: Revenue from Contracts with Customers . Other Matters Relating to Our Business as a Whole Competition and Other Factors Affecting Our Businesses As worldwide businesses, our operations can be affected by a variety of economic, industry and other factors, including those described in this section, in ""Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" included in our 2018 Annual Report, in Item 1, ""Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results,"" and in Item 1A, ""Risk Factors"" in this Form 10-K. Each business unit is subject to significant competition from a large number of companies in the U.S. and other countries, and each competes on the basis of price, delivery schedule, product performance and service. Our aerospace businesses are subject to substantial competition from various domestic and foreign manufacturers, customers and companies that obtain regulatory agency approval to manufacture spare parts, with foreign companies sometimes receiving government research and development assistance, marketing subsidies and other assistance for certain of their products beyond the assistance that may be available in the U.S. Customer selections of aircraft engines, components and systems can also have a significant impact on future sales of parts and services. In addition, the U.S. Government’s and other governments’ policies of purchasing parts from suppliers other than the original equipment manufacturer affect military spare parts sales. Significant elements of our aerospace businesses, such as spare parts sales for engines and aircraft in service, have short lead times. Therefore, backlog information may not be indicative of future demand. Additionally, our aerospace businesses' competitors may offer substantial discounts and other financial incentives, performance and operating cost guarantees, and participation in financing arrangements in an effort to compete for the aftermarket associated with these products. For information regarding customer financing commitments, participation in guarantees of customer financing arrangements and performance and operating cost guarantees, primarily related to Pratt & Whitney, see Notes 5 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2018 Annual Report. Pratt & Whitney’s major competitors in the sale of engines are GE Aviation, Honeywell, Safran Helicopter Engines, and CFM International. U.S. Government Contracts Contracting with the U.S. Government entails certain unique risks. U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for convenience or for default in the event of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. In the case of a termination for convenience, we would normally be entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred and termination costs. If terminated by the government as a result of our default, we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers. Most of our U.S. Government sales are made under fixed-price contracts, while approximately $2.0 billion or 3 percent of our total sales for 2018 were made under cost-reimbursement type contracts. Our contracts with the U.S. Government are also subject to audits. Like many defense contractors, we have received audit reports, which recommend that certain contract prices should be reduced, or that certain payments should be delayed, refunded or withheld to comply with various government regulations, including reports alleging that cost or pricing data we submitted in negotiation of the contract prices or that cost accounting practices may not have conformed to government regulations. Some of these audit reports involved substantial amounts. We have made voluntary refunds in those cases we believe appropriate, have settled some allegations and, in some cases, continue to negotiate with the government and/or litigate. For further discussion of risks related to government contracting, see Item 1A, ""Risk Factors"" and Item 3, ""Legal Proceedings,"" in this Form 10-K and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2018 Annual Report. Compliance with Environmental and Other Government Regulations Our operations are subject to and affected by environmental regulation by federal, state and local authorities in the U.S. and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our foreign operations. We have incurred and will likely continue to incur liabilities under various government statutes for the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment. We do not anticipate that compliance with current provisions relating to the protection of the environment or that any payments we may be required to make for cleanup liabilities will have a material adverse effect upon our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations. Environmental matters are further addressed in ""Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" and Notes 1 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2018 Annual Report. 7 Table of Contents Most of the U.S. laws governing environmental matters include criminal provisions. If we were convicted of a violation of the federal Clean Air Act or Clean Water Act, the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be deemed ineligible to be used in performing any U.S. Government contract we are awarded until the Environmental Protection Agency thereafter certifies that the condition giving rise to the violation has been corrected. In addition, we could be affected by future laws or regulations imposed in response to concerns over climate change. Changes in climate-related concerns, or in the regulation of such concerns, including greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including compliance costs and increased energy and raw materials costs. We conduct our businesses through subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide. Changes in legislation or government policies can affect our worldwide operations. For example, governmental regulation of refrigerants and energy efficiency standards and fire safety regulations are important to our Carrier businesses, and elevator safety codes are important to the businesses of Otis, while government safety and performance regulations, restrictions on aircraft engine noise and emissions and government procurement practices can impact our aerospace businesses. U.S. laws, regulations, orders, and other measures concerning the export or re-export of products, software, services and technology to, and other trade-related activities involving, non-U.S. countries and parties affect the operations of UTC and its affiliates. For further discussion of risks related to environmental matters and other government regulations, see Item 1A, ""Risk Factors"" and Item 3, ""Legal Proceedings,"" in this Form 10-K and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2018 Annual Report. Intellectual Property and Raw Materials and Supplies We maintain a portfolio of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, licenses and franchises related to our businesses. While we believe we have taken reasonable measures to protect this portfolio, our efforts may not be sufficient. See Item 1A ""Risk Factors"" in this Form 10-K for further discussion of intellectual property matters. We believe we have adequate sources for our purchases of materials, components, services and supplies used in our manufacturing. We work continuously with our supply base to ensure an adequate source of supply and to reduce costs. We pursue cost reductions through a number of mechanisms, including consolidating our purchases, reducing the number of suppliers, strategic global sourcing and using bidding competitions among potential suppliers. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers. Like other users in the U.S., we are largely dependent upon foreign sources for certain raw materials requirements, such as cobalt, tantalum, chromium, rhenium and nickel. We have a number of ongoing programs to manage this dependence and the accompanying risk, including long-term agreements and the conservation of materials through scrap reclamation and new manufacturing processes. We believe that our supply management practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. Although at times high prices for some raw materials important to our businesses (for example, steel, copper, aluminum, titanium and nickel) have caused margin and cost pressures, we do not foresee near term unavailability of materials, components or supplies that would have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. For further discussion of the possible effects of the cost and availability of raw materials on our business, including the risks associated with more restrictive trade policies in the U.S., and internationally, and other market risks such as the U.K.’s pending withdrawal from the EU, see Item 1A, “Risk factors” and the section titled “Business Overview in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-K and UTC’s 2018 Annual Report. Employees and Employee Relations At December 31, 2018 , our total number of employees was approximately 240,000, which includes approximately 30,000 employees added as a result of the acquisition of Rockwell Collins. Approximately 63 percent of total employees are based outside the U.S. During 2018, we negotiated 8 domestic collective bargaining agreements, the largest of which covered certain workers at Pratt & Whitney’s West Palm Beach facility. In 2019, numerous collective bargaining agreements are subject to renegotiation, the largest of which covers certain workers at Carrier’s Collierville, Tennessee facility. Although some previous contract renegotiations have had a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations in prior years, we do not anticipate that the renegotiation of these contracts in 2019 will have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations. For discussion of the effects of our restructuring actions on employment, see Item 1A, ""Risk Factors"" in this Form 10-K and under ""Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2018 Annual Report. For a discussion of other matters which may affect our competitive position, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations, including the risks of our international operations, see the further discussion under the headings ""General"" and 8 Table of Contents ""Description of Business by Segment"" in this section, Item 1A, ""Risk Factors"" in this Form 10-K, and under ""Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" in our 2018 Annual Report. 9 Table of Contents Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results This Form 10-K contains statements which, to the extent they are not statements of historical or present fact, constitute ""forward-looking statements"" under the securities laws. From time to time, oral or written forward-looking statements may also be included in other information released to the public.

Item 1A. Risk Factors Our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by the factors set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. Our Global Growth May be Affected by Global Economic, Capital Market and Political Conditions. Our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions and geopolitical risks, including credit market conditions, levels of consumer and business confidence, commodity prices, exchange rates, levels of government spending and deficits, trade policies, political conditions, actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt and other challenges that could affect the global economy. These economic conditions affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways. Tightening of credit in financial markets could adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations, could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products and services, and impact the ability of our customers to make payments. Similarly, such tightening of credit may adversely affect our supplier base and increase the potential for one or more of our suppliers to experience financial distress or bankruptcy. Our global business is also adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity, such as decreases in business and consumer 11 Table of Contents spending, air travel, construction activity, the financial strength of airlines and business jet operators, and government procurement. Our Financial Performance Is Dependent on the Conditions of the Construction and Aerospace Industries. The results of our commercial and industrial businesses, which generated approximately 47 percent of our consolidated sales in 2018 , are influenced by a number of external factors including fluctuations in residential and commercial construction activity, regulatory changes, interest rates, labor costs, foreign currency exchange rates, customer attrition, raw material and energy costs, global credit market conditions, and other global and political factors, including trade policies. A slowdown in building and remodeling activity can adversely affect the financial performance of Otis and Carrier. In addition, the financial performance of Carrier can also be influenced by production and utilization of transport equipment and, particularly in its residential business, weather conditions. The results of our commercial and military aerospace businesses, which generated approximately 53 percent of our consolidated sales in 2018 , are directly tied to the economic conditions in the commercial aviation and defense industries, which are cyclical in nature. Capital spending and demand for aircraft engines, aerospace products and component aftermarket parts and service by commercial airlines, aircraft operators and aircraft manufacturers are influenced by a wide variety of factors, including current and predicted traffic levels, load factors, aircraft fuel prices, labor issues, airline profits, airline consolidation, bankruptcies, competition, the retirement of older aircraft, regulatory changes, terrorism and related safety concerns, general economic conditions, corporate profitability, cost reduction efforts and RPO levels. Any of these factors could reduce the sales and margins of our aerospace businesses. Other factors, including future terrorist actions, pandemic health issues or major natural disasters, could also dramatically reduce the demand for air travel, which could negatively impact the sales and margins of our aerospace businesses. Additionally, because a substantial portion of the RPO for commercial aerospace customers is scheduled for delivery beyond 2019 , changes in economic conditions may cause customers to request that firm orders be rescheduled or canceled. At times, our aerospace businesses also enter into firm fixed-price or cost-share development contracts, which may require us to bear cost overruns related to unforeseen technical and design challenges that arise during the development and early production stages of the program. In addition, our aerospace businesses face intense competition from domestic and foreign manufacturers of new equipment and spare parts. Spare parts sales and aftermarket service trends are affected by similar factors, including usage, pricing, technological improvements, regulatory changes and the retirement of older aircraft. Furthermore, because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing products in these business segments to market, we cannot predict the economic conditions that will exist when any new product is complete. A reduction in capital spending in the commercial aviation or defense industries could have a significant effect on the demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. The defense industry is also affected by a changing U.S. and global political environment, continued pressure on U.S. and global defense spending and U.S. foreign policy and the level of activity in military flight operations. Should overall U.S. Government defense spending decline, it could result in significant reductions to revenue, cash flow, profit and RPO for our military businesses. One or more of the programs that we currently support or are currently pursuing could be phased-out, limited or terminated. Reductions in these existing programs, unless offset by other programs and opportunities, could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, cash flows, results of operations or financial condition. Our International Operations Subject Us to Economic Risk As Our Results of Operations May Be Adversely Affected by Changes in Foreign Currency Fluctuations, Economic Conditions, Trade Policies, and Changes in Local Government Regulation. We conduct our business on a global basis, with approximately 63 percent of our 2018 total segment sales derived from international operations, including U.S. export sales. Changes in local and regional economic conditions, including fluctuations in exchange rates, may affect product demand and reported profits in our non-U.S. operations (especially the commercial businesses and P&WC), where transactions are generally denominated in local currencies. In addition, currency fluctuations may affect the prices we pay suppliers for materials used in our products. As a result, our operating margins also may be negatively impacted by worldwide currency fluctuations that result in higher costs for certain cross border transactions. Our financial statements are denominated in U.S. Dollars. Accordingly, fluctuations in exchange rates may also give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements of non-U.S. operating units are translated into U.S. Dollars. Given that the majority of our sales are non-U.S. based, a strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against other major foreign currencies could adversely affect our results of operations. The majority of sales in the aerospace businesses are transacted in U.S. Dollars, consistent with established industry practice, while the majority of costs at locations outside the U.S. are incurred in the applicable local currency (principally the Euro, the Canadian Dollar, the British Pound and the Polish Zloty). For operating units with U.S. Dollar sales and local currency costs, there is foreign currency exposure that could impact our results of operations depending on market changes in the exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar against the applicable foreign currencies. To manage certain exposures, 12 Table of Contents we employ long-term hedging strategies associated with U.S. Dollar sales. See Notes 1 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2018 Annual Report for further discussion of our hedging strategies. Our international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws, regulations and policies, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, taxation, exchange controls, capital controls, employment regulations, and repatriation of earnings. Government policies on international trade and investments such as import quotas, capital controls, taxes or tariffs, whether adopted by individual governments or regional trade blocs, can affect demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to manufacture or sell products in certain countries. The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs, or the renegotiation of existing trade agreements by the U.S. or by countries where we sell large quantities of products and services or procure supplies and other materials incorporated into our products, including in connection with the U.K.'s pending withdrawal from the EU, could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, a government's adoption of ""buy national"" policies or retaliation by another government against such policies, such as tariffs, could have a negative impact on our results of operations. Our international sales and operations are also sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities, including government budgets, as well as to political and economic instability. International transactions may involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs in foreign countries. For example, as a condition of sale or award of a contract, some international customers require us to agree to offset arrangements, which may include in-country purchases, manufacturing and financial support arrangements. The contract may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirements. In addition, as part of our globalization strategy, we have invested in certain countries, including Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Poland, Russia, South Africa, Turkey, Ukraine and countries in the Middle East, that carry high levels of currency, political, compliance and economic risk. We expect that sales to emerging markets will continue to account for a significant portion of our sales as our businesses evolve and as these and other developing nations and regions around the world increase their demand for our products. Emerging market operations can present many risks, including cultural differences (such as employment and business practices), volatility in gross domestic product, economic and government instability, the imposition of exchange and capital controls, and the risks associated with exporting components manufactured in those countries for incorporation into finished products completed in other countries. While these factors and their impact are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. We Use a Variety of Raw Materials, Supplier-Provided Parts, Components, Sub-Systems and Contract Manufacturing Services in Our Businesses, and Significant Shortages, Supplier Capacity Constraints, Supplier Production Disruptions or Price Increases Could Increase Our Operating Costs and Adversely Impact the Competitive Positions of Our Products. Our reliance on suppliers (including third-party manufacturing suppliers and logistics providers) and commodity markets to secure raw materials, parts, components and sub-systems used in our products exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials. In many instances, we depend upon a single source of supply, manufacturing, logistics support or assembly or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers. A disruption in deliveries from our suppliers, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions, supplier quality issues, closing or bankruptcy of our suppliers, price increases, or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. We believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. Nonetheless, price increases, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions or the unavailability of some raw materials may have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. We May Not Complete the Separation Transactions or Complete Them Within the Time Frame We Anticipate; The Separation Transactions May Present Difficulties That Could Have an Adverse Effect on Us and/or the Independent Businesses Resulting from the Separation, and/or Costs Associated with the Separation Transactions May Be Higher Than Anticipated; The Independent Businesses May Underperform Relative to Our Expectations; We May Not Realize Some or All of the Expected Benefits of the Separation Transactions. On November 26, 2018, we announced our intention to separate into three independent companies: (1) UTC, an aerospace company comprised of the Collins Aerospace Systems and Pratt & Whitney businesses, (2) Otis, and (3) Carrier. The proposed separations are expected to be effected through spin-offs by UTC of Otis and Carrier that are intended to be tax-free for the Company’s shareowners for U.S. federal income tax purposes. These separation transactions will be subject to the satisfaction of a number of customary conditions, including, among others, final 13 Table of Contents approval by UTC’s Board of Directors, receipt of tax rulings in certain jurisdictions and/or a tax opinion from external counsel (as applicable), the filing with the SEC and effectiveness of Form 10 registration statements for Otis and Carrier and satisfactory completion of financing. The failure to satisfy all of the required conditions could delay the completion of the separation transactions for a significant period of time or prevent them from occurring at all. Additionally, the separation transactions are complex in nature, and unanticipated developments or changes, including changes in law, the macroeconomic environment and market conditions or regulatory or political conditions may affect our ability to complete one or both of the separation transactions as currently expected, within the anticipated time frame or at all. Any changes to one or both of the separation transactions or delay in completing one or both of the separation transactions could cause us not to realize some or all of the expected benefits, or realize them on a different timeline than expected. In addition, the terms and conditions of the required regulatory authorizations and consents that are granted, if any, may impose requirements, limitations or costs, or place restrictions on the conduct of the independent companies or may materially delay the completion of one or both of the separation transactions. And, although we intend for the separation transactions to be tax-free to the Company’s shareowners for U.S. federal income tax purposes, there can be no assurance that the separation transactions will so qualify. If the separation transactions were ultimately determined to be taxable, we, the Company’s shareowners and/or the new independent companies would incur income tax liabilities that could be significant. Furthermore, if the separation transactions are completed, we cannot be assured that each separate company will be successful. Whether or not the separation transactions are completed, our businesses may face material challenges in connection with these transactions, including, without limitation: • the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business concerns and impact on the businesses of UTC (including Otis and Carrier) as a result of the devotion of management’s attention to the separation transactions; • maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees; • retaining existing business and operational relationships, including with customers, suppliers, employees and other counterparties, and attracting new business and operational relationships; • execution and related risks in connection with UTC, Otis and Carrier financing transactions undertaken in connection with the separation transactions; • foreseen and unforeseen dis-synergy costs, costs of restructuring transactions (including taxes) and other significant costs and expenses; and • potential negative reactions from the financial markets if we fail to complete the separation transactions as currently expected, within the anticipated time frame or at all. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or the price of our common stock. In addition, if the separation transactions are completed, each of the separate companies will incur ongoing costs, including costs of operating as independent companies, that the separated businesses will no longer be able to share. Those costs may exceed our estimates or could diminish the benefits we expect to realize from the separation transactions. If the Separation Transactions Are Completed, UTC and the Independent Businesses’ Operational and Financial Profiles Will Change and Each Will Be a Smaller, Less Diversified Company Than UTC as It Exists Today. The separation transactions will result in UTC, Otis and Carrier being smaller, less diversified companies with more limited businesses concentrated in their respective industries. Of note, UTC’s businesses following the expected separation transactions will be significantly more reliant on three customers, namely Airbus, Boeing and the U.S. Government. As a result, each company may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the diversification of revenues, costs, and cash flows will diminish, such that each company’s results of operations, cash flows, working capital, effective tax rate, and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility and its ability to fund capital expenditures and investments, pay dividends and service debt may be diminished. It is anticipated that the effective tax rate for each separate company will differ from the UTC consolidated effective tax rate. If the Separation Transactions Are Completed, There May Be Changes in Our Shareowner Base, Which May Cause the Price of Our Common Stock To Fluctuate . Investors holding our common stock may hold our common stock because of a decision to invest in a company that operates in multiple markets with a diversified portfolio. If the separation transactions are completed, shares of our common stock will represent an investment in a business concentrated in the commercial aerospace and defense industry, 14 Table of Contents and shares of the common stock of the new independent companies conducting the Otis and Carrier businesses will represent investments in businesses concentrated in their respective industries. These changes may not match some shareowners’ investment strategies, which could cause them to sell their shares of our common stock or the common stock of the new independent companies, and excessive selling pressure could cause the market price to decrease following the consummation of the separation transactions. Additionally, we cannot predict whether the market value of our common stock and the common stock of each of the new independent companies after the separation transactions will be, in the aggregate, less than, equal to or greater than the market value of our common stock prior to the separation transactions. We Engage in Acquisitions and Divestitures, and May Encounter Difficulties Integrating Acquired Businesses with, or Disposing of Divested Businesses From, Our Current Operations; Therefore, We May Not Realize the Anticipated Benefits of these Acquisitions and Divestitures. We seek to grow through strategic acquisitions in addition to internal growth. In the past several years, we have made various acquisitions and have entered into joint ventures intended to complement and expand our businesses. We expect to continue to undertake such transactions in the future. Our due diligence reviews may not identify all of the material issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingencies of a particular transaction, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition target’s previous activities. For example, we may incur unanticipated costs, expenses or other liabilities as a result of an acquisition target’s violation of applicable laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) or similar anti-bribery and corruption laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions. We also may incur unanticipated costs or expenses, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, litigation, and other liabilities. We also may encounter difficulties in integrating acquired businesses with our operations, applying our internal controls processes to these acquired businesses, or in managing strategic investments. Additionally, we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into a transaction. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, accounting requirements relating to business combinations, including the requirement to expense certain acquisition costs as incurred, may cause us to incur greater earnings volatility and generally lower earnings during periods in which we acquire new businesses. Furthermore, we make strategic divestitures from time to time. Our divestitures may result in continued financial exposure to the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements or continued supply and services arrangements, following the transaction. Under these arrangements, nonperformance by those divested businesses could result in obligations being imposed on us that could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, cash flows, results of operations, or financial condition. The success of future acquisitions and divestitures will depend on the satisfaction of conditions precedent to, and consummation of, the pending transactions, the timing of consummation of these pending transactions, and the ability of the parties to secure any required regulatory approvals in a timely manner, among other things. We also enter into joint ventures in which we maintain significant influence, but do not control the businesses. Accordingly, our ability to apply our internal controls and compliance policies to these businesses is limited and can result in additional financial and reputational risks. The Rockwell Collins acquisition may cause our financial results to differ from our expectations or the expectations of the investment community; we may not be able to achieve anticipated cost savings or other anticipated synergies. The ultimate success of the Rockwell Collins acquisition will depend, in part, on UTC’s ability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses of UTC and Rockwell Collins, and realize the anticipated benefits, including revenue and cost synergies, innovation opportunities and operational efficiencies, from the acquisition. If UTC is unable to achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, and the value of UTC’s common stock may decline as a result. The integration of the two companies may result in material challenges, including, without limitation: • the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business concerns and performance shortfalls at Collins Aerospace Systems as a result of the devotion of management’s attention to the integration; • managing a larger combined aerospace systems business; • maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees; • retaining existing business and operational relationships, including customers, suppliers and other counterparties, as may be impacted by contracts containing consent and/or other provisions that may be triggered by the acquisition, and attracting new business and operational relationships; • the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process; • consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations; • coordinating geographically separate organizations; 15 Table of Contents • unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems; • increased competitive pressure from customers; and • unforeseen expenses or delays associated with the acquisition. Our Debt Levels and Related Debt Service Obligations Could Have Negative Consequences; Our Ability to Access Debt May Be Affected by Our Increased Indebtedness, Changes in Global Capital Markets, Our Financial Performance or Outlook, the Expected Separation Transactions or Our Credit Ratings. We have outstanding debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity. In connection with the Rockwell Collins acquisition, we issued $11 billion of aggregate principal notes, and $7.8 billion of Rockwell Collins debt remained outstanding at the time of the closing of the acquisition. As expected, the completion of the acquisition resulted in a downgrade of UTC's long-term issuer credit ratings by one notch. Following the announcement of the expected separation transactions, one credit agency placed UTC's long-term issuer credit rating on negative outlook. The expected separation transactions and the increased indebtedness of UTC in connection with the Rockwell Collins acquisition may have the effect of, among other things: • requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt or the payment of costs associated with the separation transactions, which will reduce funds we have available for other purposes, such as acquisitions, reinvestment in our businesses, dividends and repurchases of our common stock; • reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions; • exposing us to interest rate risk at the time of refinancing outstanding debt or on the portion of our debt obligations that are issued at variable rates; and • further downgrades of our credit ratings resulting in increased borrowing costs. We depend, in part, upon the issuance of debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments. If we require additional funding in order to fund outstanding financing commitments or meet other business requirements, our market liquidity may not be sufficient. A number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt, including disruptions or declines in the global capital markets and/or a decline in our financial performance, outlook or credit ratings. Quarterly Cash Dividends and Share Repurchases May Be Discontinued or Modified, Are Subject to a Number of Uncertainties and May Affect the Price of Our Common Stock. Quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases under our share repurchase program constitute components of our capital allocation strategy, which we fund with free operating cash flow, borrowings and divestitures. However, we are not required to declare dividends or make any share repurchases under our share repurchase program. Dividends and share repurchases may be discontinued, accelerated, suspended or delayed at any time without prior notice. Even if not discontinued, the amount of such dividends and repurchases may be changed, and the amount, timing and frequency of such dividends and repurchases may vary from historical practice or from the company’s stated expectations. Decisions with respect to dividends and share repurchases are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be based on a variety of factors. Important factors that could cause us to discontinue, limit, suspend, increase or delay our quarterly cash dividends or share repurchases include market conditions, the price of our common stock, the nature and timing of other investment opportunities, changes in our business strategy, the terms of our financing arrangements, our outlook as to the ability to obtain financing at attractive rates, the impact on our credit ratings and the availability of domestic cash. To help manage the cash flow and liquidity impact resulting from the Rockwell Collins acquisition and the proposed separation transactions, we have limited our share repurchases. The reduction or elimination of our cash dividend or share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Additionally, there can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance shareholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of common stock. Although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term shareholder value, short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program's effectiveness. See Item 5, ""Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities"" in this Form 10-K for a description of our share repurchase program and past share repurchases. 16 Table of Contents We Design, Manufacture and Service Products that Incorporate Advanced Technologies; The Introduction of New Products and Technologies Involves Risks and We May Not Realize the Degree or Timing of Benefits Initially Anticipated. We seek to achieve growth through the design, development, production, sale and support of innovative products that incorporate advanced technologies. The product, program and service needs of our customers change and evolve regularly, and we invest substantial amounts in research and development efforts to pursue advancements in a wide range of technologies, products and services. Of particular note, Pratt & Whitney is currently producing and delivering the PurePower PW1000G Geared Turbofan engine to power various aircraft, including the A320neo family of aircraft, which entered into service in January 2016. The level of orders received for the PurePower family of engines coupled with a requirement to achieve mature production levels in a very short time frame require significant additional manufacturing and supply chain capacity. If any of our production ramp-up efforts are delayed, if suppliers cannot timely deliver or perform to our standards, and/or if we identify or experience issues with in-service engines, we may not meet customers’ production schedules, which could result in material additional costs, including liquidated damages or other liabilities that could be assessed under existing contracts. Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our technological advancements depends on a variety of factors, including meeting development, production, certification and regulatory approval schedules; execution of internal and external performance plans; availability of supplier and internally produced parts and materials; performance of suppliers and subcontractors; availability of supplier and internal facility capacity to perform maintenance, repair and overhaul services on our products; hiring and training of qualified personnel; achieving cost and production efficiencies; identification of emerging technological trends in our target end-markets; validation of innovative technologies; the level of customer interest in new technologies and products; and customer acceptance of products we manufacture, or that incorporate technologies we develop. For example, our customers manufacture end products and larger aerospace systems that incorporate certain of our aerospace products. These systems and end products may incorporate additional technologies manufactured by third parties and involve additional risks and uncertainties. As a result, the performance and market acceptance of these larger systems and end products could affect the level of customer interest and acceptance of our products in the marketplace. Development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses, and these efforts may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings. In addition, the markets for our products or products that incorporate our technologies may not develop or grow as we anticipate. We or our customers, suppliers or subcontractors may encounter difficulties in developing and producing new products and services, and may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated or may otherwise suffer significant adverse financial consequences. Due to the design complexity of our products, we may experience delays in completing the development and introduction of new products. Delays could result in increased development costs or deflect resources from other projects. In particular, we cannot predict with certainty whether, when and in what quantities our aerospace businesses will produce and sell aircraft engines, aircraft systems and components and other products currently in development or pending required certifications. Our contracts are typically awarded on a competitive basis. Our bids are based upon, among other items, the cost to provide the products and services. To generate an acceptable return on our investment in these contracts, we must be able to accurately estimate our costs to provide the services and deliver the products required by the contract and to be able to complete the contracts in a timely manner. If we fail to accurately estimate our costs or the time required to complete a contract, the profitability of our contracts may be materially and adversely affected. Some of our contracts provide for liquidated damages in the event that we are unable to perform and deliver in accordance with the contractual specifications and schedule. In addition, we may face customer directed cost reduction targets that could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our contracts. Furthermore, our competitors, including our customers, may develop competing technologies which gain market acceptance in advance of or instead of our products. The possibility also exists that our competitors might develop new technologies or offerings that might cause our existing technologies and offerings to become obsolete. In addition, the possibility exists that competitors will develop aftermarket services and aftermarket parts for our products which attract customers and adversely impact our return on investment on new products. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Our Business May Be Affected by Government Contracting Risks. Most of our contracts with the U.S. Government are fixed price, which subjects us to the risk of reduced margins or losses if we are unable to achieve estimated costs, performance improvements, or efficiencies. 17 Table of Contents U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for convenience or for default. If terminated for convenience, we generally would be entitled to recover payment for work completed and certain termination costs. If terminated for default, the government would pay only for the work that has been accepted and could require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the undelivered goods or services from another source as well as other damages resulting from the default. We are now, and believe that in light of the current U.S. Government contracting environment we will continue to be, the subject of U.S. Government investigations relating to our U.S. Government contracts. Such U.S. Government investigations often take years to complete and could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities, including repayments, fines, treble and other damages, forfeitures, restitution or penalties, or could lead to suspension or debarment of U.S. Government contracting or of export privileges. For instance, if we or one of our business units were charged with wrongdoing in connection with a U.S. Government investigation (including fraud, or violation of certain environmental or export laws, as further described below), the U.S. Government could suspend us from bidding on or receiving awards of new U.S. Government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings. If convicted or found liable, the U.S. Government could fine and debar us from new U.S. Government contracting for a period generally not to exceed three years and could void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud. We also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, even if such allegations are later determined to be unsubstantiated. Our contracts with the U.S. Government are also subject to audit. Like many defense contractors, we have received audit reports recommending that certain contract prices should be reduced, or that certain payments should be delayed, refunded or withheld to comply with various government regulations, including reports alleging that cost or pricing data we submitted in negotiation of the contract prices was incomplete or that cost accounting practices may not have conformed to government regulations. Some of these audit reports involve substantial amounts, of which those that allege noncompliance with the cost accounting practices associated with our military engine business could, if the audit reports’ theories were to prevail in litigation, increase the costs absorbed by our commercial engine business in the future. Exports of Certain of Our Products Are Subject to Various Export Control and Sanctions Regulations and May Require Authorization From the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Department of the Treasury or Regulatory Agencies of Other Countries. We must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the export of products, services and technology from the U.S. and other countries having jurisdiction over our operations. In the U.S., these laws include, among others, the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) administered by the U.S. Department of State and embargoes and sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Certain of our products, services and technologies have military or strategic applications and are on the U.S. Munitions List of the ITAR and the Commerce Control List of the EAR, or are otherwise subject to the EAR. In addition, U.S. foreign policy may restrict or prohibit our ability to engage in business dealings with certain individuals, entities or countries. As a result, our ability to export our products or services to certain countries or for particular end-uses or end-users may require authorization. Any failure by us or our customers or suppliers to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal penalties, fines, seizure of our products, adverse publicity, restrictions on our ability to export our products, or the suspension or debarment from doing business with the U.S. Government. Moreover, any changes in export control or sanctions regulations may further restrict the export of our products or services, and the possibility of such changes requires constant monitoring to ensure we remain compliant. The length of time required by the licensing processes can vary, potentially delaying the shipment of products or performance of services and the recognition of the corresponding revenue. Any restrictions on the export of our products or product lines could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. We Are Subject to Litigation, Environmental, Product Safety and Other Legal and Compliance Risks. We are subject to a variety of litigation and legal compliance risks. These risks relate to, among other things, product safety, personal injuries, intellectual property rights, contract-related claims, government contracts, taxes, environmental matters and compliance with U.S. and foreign laws, competition laws and laws governing improper business practices. We or one of our business units could be charged with wrongdoing as a result of such matters. If convicted or found liable, we could be subject to significant fines, penalties, repayments, other damages (in certain cases, treble damages). As a global business, we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate. Those laws and regulations may be interpreted in different ways. They may also change from time to time, as may related interpretations and other guidance. Changes in laws or regulations could result in higher expenses. Uncertainty relating to laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights. Changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, 18 Table of Contents including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures. Changes in climate change concerns, or in the regulation of such concerns, including greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw materials costs. Climate-related events also could disrupt our businesses and require us to incur additional costs. At times we are involved in disputes with private parties over environmental issues, including litigation over the allocation of cleanup costs, alleged personal injuries and alleged property damage. Personal injury lawsuits may involve individual and purported class actions alleging that contaminants originating from our or our subsidiaries’ current or former products or operating facilities caused or contributed to medical conditions, including cancers incurred by employees, former employees, third-parties' employees or residents in the area, and environmental damage or diminution of real estate values. Even in litigation where we believe our liability is remote, there is a risk that a negative finding or decision in a matter involving multiple plaintiffs or a purported class action could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, in particular with respect to environmental claims in regions where we have, or previously had, significant operations. Product recalls and product liability claims (including claims related to the safety or reliability of our products) also can result in significant costs, including fines, as well as negative publicity, management distraction and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our products and services. In addition, the FCPA and other anti-bribery and corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA applies to companies, individual directors, officers, employees and agents. U.S. companies also may be held liable for actions taken by strategic or local partners or representatives. The FCPA also imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded U.S. corporations and their foreign affiliates, which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments. Certain of our customer relationships outside of the U.S. are with governmental entities and are therefore subject to the FCPA and other anti-bribery and corruption laws. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery and corruption laws. Despite meaningful measures that we undertake to ensure lawful conduct, which include training and internal control policies, these measures may not always prevent our employees or agents from violating the FCPA or similar laws. As a result, we could be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement, further changes or enhancements to our procedures, policies and controls, personnel changes or other remedial actions. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our operations, cause reputational harm, involve significant management distraction and result in a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Cybersecurity and data privacy and protection laws and regulations are evolving and present increasing compliance challenges, which increase our costs, may affect our competitiveness, cause reputational harm, and expose us to substantial fines or other penalties. For a description of current material legal proceedings and regulatory matters, see ""Legal Proceedings"" in in this Form 10-K and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2018 Annual Report. Additional Tax Expense or Additional Tax Exposures Could Affect Our Future Profitability. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and various international jurisdictions. Changes in tax laws and regulations, as well as changes and conflicts in related interpretations and other tax guidance could materially impact our tax receivables and liabilities and our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business we are subject to examinations by various tax authorities. In addition to ongoing investigations, there could be additional investigations launched in the future by governmental authorities in various jurisdictions, and existing investigations could be expanded. The global and diverse nature of our operations means that these risks will continue to exist and additional investigations, proceedings and contingencies will arise from time to time. Our competitive position, cash flows, results of operation or financial condition may be affected by the outcome of investigations, proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the headings ""Business Overview, """"Results of Operations - Income Taxes,"" and ""Liquidity and Financial Condition"" and Notes 1 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2018 Annual Report for further discussion on income taxes and related contingencies, including our accounting and assessment of the effect of the TCJA. Our Defined Benefit Pension Plans are Subject to Financial Market Risk that Could Adversely Affect Our Results. The performance of the financial markets and interest rates can impact our defined benefit pension plan expenses and funding obligations. Significant decreases in the discount rate or investment losses on plan assets may increase our 19 Table of Contents funding obligations and adversely impact our financial results. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2018 Annual Report for further discussion on pension plans and related obligations and contingencies. We May Be Unable to Realize Expected Benefits From Our Cost Reduction and Restructuring Efforts and Our Profitability May Be Hurt or Our Business Otherwise Might Be Adversely Affected. In order to operate more efficiently and control costs, we announce from time to time restructuring plans, which include workforce reductions as well as global facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives. These plans are intended to generate operating expense savings through reductions in direct and indirect expenses as well as improved efficiencies. We may undertake further workforce reductions or restructuring actions in the future. These types of cost reduction and restructuring activities are complex. If we do not successfully manage our current restructuring activities, or any future restructuring activities, expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized, and our operations and business could be disrupted. Risks associated with these actions and other workforce management issues include unfavorable political responses to such actions, unforeseen delays in the implementation of anticipated workforce reductions, additional unexpected costs, adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees or work stoppages, any of which may impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions, or otherwise harm our business, or have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Our Business and Financial Performance May Be Adversely Affected By Cyber-attacks on Information Technology Infrastructure and Products and Other Business Disruptions Our business may be impacted by disruptions to our own or third-party information technology (“IT”) infrastructure, which could result from (among other causes) cyber-attacks on or failures of such infrastructure or compromises to its physical security, as well as from damaging weather or other acts of nature. Cyber-based risks, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, both attacks on our IT infrastructure and attacks on the IT infrastructure of third parties (both on premises and in the cloud) attempting to gain unauthorized access to our confidential or other proprietary information, classified information, or information relating to our employees, customers and other third parties. Cyber-based risks could also include attacks targeting the security, integrity and/or availability of the hardware, software and information installed, stored or transmitted in our products, including after the purchase of those products and when they are incorporated into third-party products, facilities or infrastructure. Such attacks could disrupt our systems or those of third parties, impact business operations, result in unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, and corrupt our data or that of third parties. We have experienced cyber-based attacks, and due to the evolving threat landscape, may continue to experience them going forward, potentially with more frequency. We continue to make investments and adopt measures designed to enhance our protection, detection, response, and recovery capabilities, and to mitigate potential risks to our technology, products, services and operations from potential cyber-attacks. However, given the unpredictability, nature and scope of cyber-attacks, it is possible that potential vulnerabilities could go undetected for an extended period. We could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromise of confidential or otherwise protected information, misappropriation, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our or third-party systems, networks or products, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business, potential liability, penalties, fines and/or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Due to the evolving nature of such risks, the impact of any potential incident cannot be predicted. We Depend On Our Intellectual Property, and Have Access to Certain Intellectual Property and Information of Our Customers and Suppliers; Infringement or Failure to Protect Our Intellectual Property Could Adversely Affect Our Future Growth and Success. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements, information technology security systems, internal controls and compliance systems and other measures to protect our intellectual property. We also rely on nondisclosure agreements, information technology security systems and other measures to protect certain customer and supplier information and intellectual property that we have in our possession or to which we have access. Our efforts to protect intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient. We cannot be sure that our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents to us, that patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to preclude our competitors from introducing technologies similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications. Our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the U.S. In addition, we may be the target of competitor or other third-party patent enforcement actions seeking substantial monetary damages or seeking to prevent our sale and marketing of certain of our products or 20 Table of Contents services. Our competitive position also may be adversely impacted by limitations on our ability to obtain possession of, and ownership or necessary licenses concerning, data important to the development or provision of our products or service offerings, or by limitations on our ability to restrict the use by others of data related to our products or services. We may also be subject to disruptions, losses and liability resulting from various cybersecurity attacks or information technology failures, as described above. Any of these events or factors could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, subject us to judgments, penalties and significant litigation costs or temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 2. Properties We operate in approximately 120 countries, with over 650 significant properties comprising approximately 96 million square feet of productive space. Approximately 57% of our significant properties are associated with our aerospace businesses and 43% are associated with our commercial businesses. Approximately 47% of our significant properties are leased, and 53% are owned. Approximately 49% of our significant properties are located in the United States. Our fixed assets as of December 31, 2018 include manufacturing facilities and non-manufacturing facilities such as warehouses, and a substantial quantity of machinery and equipment, most of which are general purpose machinery and equipment using special jigs, tools and fixtures and in many instances having automatic control features and special adaptations. The facilities, warehouses, machinery and equipment in use as of December 31, 2018 are in good operating condition, are well-maintained and substantially all are generally in regular use. Item 3. Legal Proceedings Federal Securities Laws Litigation On January 2, 2018, a purported shareowner filed a second amended complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York under the federal securities laws against the Company and certain of its current and former executives ( Frankfurt-Trust Investment Luxemburg AG v. United Technologies Corporation et al.), which further amends a previously disclosed complaint that was filed on May 10, 2017 . In the second amended complaint, the plaintiff purports to represent a class of shareowners who purchased the Company’s stock between December 11, 2014 and July 20, 2015. The second amended complaint alleges violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, related to alleged false and misleading statements and omissions of material fact made in connection with the Company’s 2015 earnings expectations. On September 28, 2018, the Court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss the case in its entirety. On October 25, 2018, the plaintiff filed a Notice of Appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Rockwell Collins' Voluntary Disclosure In 2018, and before its acquisition by UTC, Rockwell Collins voluntarily disclosed to the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and the SEC Division of Enforcement that it was conducting an internal investigation regarding meal, entertainment, and gift expenditures of B/E Aerospace sales employees that may not have complied with then-applicable company policy, as well as a potential conflict of interest involving a third party sales agent for B/E Aerospace in China. The internal investigation, which is ongoing, resulted from Rockwell Collins’ post-acquisition compliance review of B/E Aerospace. UTC continues to cooperate fully with the DOJ and SEC. Because the matter is ongoing, we cannot predict the outcome or the consequences thereof at this time. Rockwell Collins previously disclosed this matter in its public SEC filings, beginning in April 2018. In addition, we are subject to a number of other lawsuits, investigations and claims (some of which involve substantial amounts). For a discussion of contingencies related to certain other legal proceedings, see Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2018 Annual Report. Except as indicated herein or in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2018 Annual Report, we do not believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect upon our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. 21 Table of Contents A further discussion of government contracts and related investigations, as well as a discussion of our environmental liabilities, can be found under the heading ""Other Matters Relating to Our Business as a Whole – Compliance with Environmental and Other Government Regulations"" in Item 1, ""Business,"" and in Item 1A, ""Risk Factors,"" in this Form 10-K.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), the Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and the Corporate Vice President, Controller (Controller), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Based upon our evaluation, our CEO, CFO and Controller concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO, CFO and Controller, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Our management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 . In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in its 2013 Internal Control – Integrated Framework. Our management has concluded that based on its assessment, our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2018 . The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which appears in our 2018 Annual Report. On November 26, 2018, the Company completed its merger of Rockwell Collins. Accordingly, the acquired assets and liabilities of Rockwell Collins are included in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018 and the results of its operations and cash flows are reported in our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows from November 26, 2018 through December 31, 2018. We have elected to exclude Rockwell Collins from the scope of our report on internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018. Rockwell Collins is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues excluded from the scope of our report represent 5 percent and 1 percent, respectively of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018.

PART I ITEM 1. Business We design and manufacture semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. Our operations began in 1930, and we are incorporated in Delaware. With headquarters in Dallas, Texas, we have design, manufacturing or sales operations in more than 30 countries. Our two reportable segments are Analog and Embedded Processing, and we report the results of our remaining business activities in Other. In 2022, we generated $20.03 billion of revenue. For decades, we have operated with a passion to create a better world by making electronics more affordable through semiconductors. We were pioneers in the transition from vacuum tubes to transistors and then to integrated circuits. As each generation became more reliable, more affordable and lower in power, semiconductors were used by a growing number of customers and markets. This passion is alive today as we help our customers develop electronics and new applications, particularly in industrial and automotive markets. For many years, we have run our business with three overarching ambitions in mind. First, we will act like owners who will own the company for decades. Second, we will adapt and succeed in a world that is ever changing. And third, we will be a company that we are personally proud to be a part of and that we would want as our neighbor. Our ambitions are foundational to ensuring that we operate in a sustainable, socially thoughtful and environmentally responsible manner. When we are successful in achieving these ambitions, our employees, customers, communities and shareholders all win. As engineers, we are fortunate to work on exciting technology which helps our customers innovate to create a better world. Technology is the foundation of our company, but ultimately, our objective and the best metric for owners to measure our progress is through the growth of free cash flow per share over the long term. Our strategy to maximize long-term free cash flow per share growth has three elements: The first element of our strategy is a business model that is focused on analog and embedded processing products and built around four competitive advantages. This business model is the result of a series of strategic decisions made over the years and that continue today. The four sustainable competitive advantages are a strong foundation of manufacturing and technology, a broad portfolio of analog and embedded processing products, the reach of our market channels, and diversity and longevity of our products, markets and customer positions. In combination, these four competitive advantages provide tangible benefits, are difficult to replicate and ultimately separate us from our best peers. Together, these competitive advantages help position TI in a unique class of companies capable of generating and returning significant amounts of cash for our owners. We make our investments with an eye towards long-term strengthening and leveraging of these advantages. The second element of our strategy to maximize free cash flow per share growth is disciplined allocation of capital. This spans how we select R&D projects, develop new capabilities like TI.com, invest in new manufacturing capacity or how we think about acquisitions and returning cash to our owners. Over a 10-year period from 2013 to 2022, we allocated $87 billion, which reinforces the importance of discipline in capital allocation. The largest allocation over this period was to drive organic growth, which includes investments in R&D, sales and marketing, capital expenditures and working capital for inventory. In this period, we allocated just over $10 billion to capital expenditures. Going forward, we expect increased capital expenditures to be the largest driver of free cash flow growth over the next 10 to 15 years. Beyond that, we also allocated capital to dividends and share repurchases. Dividends are designed to appeal to a broad set of investors, and share repurchases are made with the goal of the accretive capture of future free cash flow for long-term investors. Lastly, for inorganic growth, we allocate to acquisitions that meet our financial and strategic objectives. The third element of our strategy is efficiency, which we think of as constantly striving for more output for every dollar spent. This is about getting our investments in the most impactful areas to maximize the growth of long-term free cash flow per share; it is not just about optimizing cost-cutting to get to the last dollar of expense. We bring this philosophy of efficiency and continuous improvement to all areas of the company, and this focus on efficiency contributes to revenue growth, improved gross margins, disciplined R&D and SG&A expense, free cash flow margins and ultimately to free cash flow per share growth. 2 We believe that our business model with the combined effect of our four competitive advantages sets TI apart from our peers and will for a long time to come. We will invest to strengthen our competitive advantages, be disciplined in capital allocation and stay diligent in our pursuit of efficiencies. Finally, we will remain focused on the belief that long-term growth of free cash flow per share is the ultimate measure to generate value. Product information Semiconductors are electronic components that serve as the building blocks inside modern electronic systems and equipment. Semiconductors, generally known as “chips,” combine multiple transistors to form a complete electronic circuit. We have a diverse product portfolio that is used to accomplish many different things, such as converting and amplifying signals, interfacing with other devices, managing and distributing power, processing data, canceling noise and improving signal resolution. This broad portfolio includes approximately 80,000 products that are integral to almost every type of electronic equipment. Our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels. Our segments also reflect how management allocates resources and measures results. Analog Our Analog segment generated $15.36 billion of revenue in 2022. Analog semiconductors change real-world signals, such as sound, temperature, pressure or images, by conditioning them, amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors. Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in all electronic equipment by converting, distributing, storing, discharging, isolating and measuring electrical energy, whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or using a battery. As the digitization of electronics continues, there is a growing need and opportunity for analog chips to provide the power to run devices and the critical interfaces with human beings, the real world and other electronic devices. Our Analog products are used in many markets, particularly industrial, automotive and personal electronics. Sales of our Analog products generated about 77% of our revenue in 2022. Our Analog segment includes the following major product lines: Power and Signal Chain. Power Power includes products that help customers manage power in electronic systems. Our broad portfolio is designed to manage power requirements across different voltage levels, including battery-management solutions, DC/DC switching regulators, AC/DC and isolated controllers and converters, power switches, linear regulators, voltage references and lighting products. Signal Chain Signal Chain includes products that sense, condition and measure real-world signals to allow information to be transferred or converted for further processing and control. Our Signal Chain products include amplifiers, data converters, interface products, motor drives, clocks, logic and sensing products. Embedded Processing Our Embedded Processing segment generated $3.26 billion of revenue in 2022. Embedded Processing products are the digital “brains” of many types of electronic equipment. They are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for various combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application. Our devices vary from simple, low-cost microcontrollers used in applications such as electric toothbrushes to highly specialized, complex devices such as motor control. Our Embedded Processing products are used in many markets, particularly industrial and automotive. An important characteristic of our Embedded Processing products is that our customers often invest their own research and development (R&D) to write software that operates on our products. This investment tends to increase the length of our customer relationships because many customers prefer to reuse software from one product generation to the next. 3 Sales of Embedded Processing products generated about 16% of our revenue in 2022. Our Embedded Processing segment includes microcontrollers, digital signal processors (DSPs) and applications processors. Microcontrollers are self-contained systems with a processor core, memory and peripherals that are designed to control a set of specific tasks for electronic equipment. DSPs perform mathematical computations almost instantaneously to process or improve digital data. Applications processors are designed for specific computing activity. Other We report the results of our remaining business activities in Other, which includes operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for individually reportable segments and cannot be aggregated with other operating segments. Other generated $1.41 billion of revenue in 2022 and includes revenue from DLP ® products (primarily used to project high-definition images), calculators and certain custom semiconductors known as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). In Other, we also include items that are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments. Examples of these items include acquisition, integration and restructuring charges, as well as certain corporate-level items, such as litigation expenses, environmental costs and gains and losses from other activities, including asset dispositions. 4 Markets for our products The table below lists the major markets for our products in 2022 and the estimated percentage of our 2022 revenue that the market represented. The chart also lists, in declining order of our revenue, the sectors within each market. Market Sector Industrial Factory automation & control (40% of TI revenue) Grid infrastructure Medical Building automation Test & measurement Aerospace & defense Appliances Motor drives Power delivery Pro audio, video & signage Industrial transport Retail automation & payment Lighting Automotive Infotainment & cluster (25% of TI revenue) Hybrid, electric & powertrain systems Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) Body electronics & lighting Passive safety Personal electronics PC & notebooks (20% of TI revenue) Mobile phones Portable electronics TV Connected peripherals & printers Home theater & entertainment Tablets Wearables (non-medical) Gaming Data storage Communications equipment Wireless infrastructure (7% of TI revenue) Wired networking Broadband fixed line access Datacom module Enterprise systems Data center & enterprise computing (6% of TI revenue) Enterprise projectors Enterprise machine Other (calculators and other) (2% of TI revenue) Market characteristics Competitive landscape Despite consolidation, the analog and embedded processing markets remain highly fragmented. As a result, we face significant global competition from dozens of large and small companies, including both broad-based suppliers and niche suppliers. Our competitors also include emerging companies, particularly in Asia. 5 We believe that competitive performance in the semiconductor market generally depends on several factors, including the breadth of a company’s product line, the strength and reach of its channels to market, technological innovation, product development execution, technical support, customer service, quality, reliability, price and manufacturing capacity and capabilities. In addition, manufacturing process and package technologies that provide differentiated levels of performance and a structural cost advantage are competitive factors for our analog products, and customers’ prior investments in software development is a competitive factor for our embedded processing products. Market cycle The “semiconductor cycle” refers to the ebb and flow of supply and demand and the building and depleting of inventories. The semiconductor market historically has been characterized by periods of tight supply caused by strengthening demand and/or insufficient manufacturing capacity, followed by periods of surplus inventory caused by weakening demand and/or excess manufacturing capacity. These are typically referred to as upturns and downturns in the semiconductor cycle. Semiconductor cycles are affected by the significant time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing facilities. Seasonality Our revenue is subject to some seasonal variation. Historically, our sequential revenue growth rate tends to be weaker in the first and fourth quarters when compared with the second and third quarters. Customers, sales and distribution We sell our products to over 100,000 customers. Our customer base is diverse, with more than 40% of our revenue derived from customers outside our largest 100. We market and sell our products through direct sales channels, including our website and broad sales and marketing team, and, to a lesser extent, through distributors. Over the past several years, we have been investing in new capabilities to build closer direct customer relationships. As a result, in 2022 about 70% of our revenue was direct, which includes TI.com, as customers valued the convenience of purchasing online. Closer direct relationships with our customers help to strengthen our reach of market channel advantage and give us access to more customers and more of their design projects, leading to opportunities to sell more of our products into each design. Additionally, broader and deeper access gives us better insight and knowledge of customer needs. Our investments in new and improved capabilities to directly support our customers include website and e-commerce enhancements as well as inventory consignment programs and order fulfillment services. Our TI.com e-commerce channel offers a localized online experience in many countries, with convenience features such as immediate availability, local currency, payment methods, invoicing and importer of record. Our new application programming interfaces (APIs) give customers the ability to directly access real-time inventory information about TI products from their own systems, enabling them to purchase available chips immediately to better support their supply needs, reducing cost and delays. In addition to doing business directly with TI, we offer customers the option of using a single worldwide distributor and a few region-specific distributors for order fulfillment. Manufacturing Semiconductor manufacturing begins with a sequence of photolithographic and chemical processing steps that fabricate a number of semiconductor devices on a thin silicon wafer. Each device on the wafer is packaged and tested. The entire process takes place in highly specialized facilities that require substantial investments. We own and operate semiconductor manufacturing facilities in North America, Asia, Japan and Europe. These include both wafer fabrication and assembly/test facilities. 6 We invest in manufacturing technologies and do most of our manufacturing in-house. This strategic decision to make manufacturing and technology a core competitive advantage provides us with tangible benefits of lower manufacturing costs and greater control of our supply chain, offering our customers geopolitically dependable capacity. We have focused on creating a competitive manufacturing structural cost advantage by investing in our advanced 300-mm capacity. An unpackaged chip built on a 300-mm wafer costs about 40% less than an unpackaged chip built on a 200-mm wafer. We continue to invest to strengthen our competitive advantage in manufacturing and technology as part of our long-term capacity planning. Progress and investments include: • starting production in 300-mm wafer fabrication facility RFAB2 (Richardson, Texas); • starting production in 300-mm wafer fabrication facility LFAB (Lehi, Utah); and • starting construction on our next two 300-mm wafer fabrication facilities in Sherman, Texas, SM1 and SM2. This North Texas site has the potential for four fabrication facilities to meet demand over time, as semiconductor growth in electronics, particularly in industrial and automotive markets, is expected to continue well into the future. SM1 production is expected to begin in 2025. Together, these investments are designed to strengthen our manufacturing and technology competitive advantage, provide us with lower costs and greater control of our supply chain, and support growth over the next 10 to 15 years. We assess and are careful to address potential health, safety, and environmental risks presented by our operations, including our manufacturing operations. We care for our environment and work to prevent pollution and the potential risks related to climate change. We invest to reduce emissions long-term by installing abatement devices, using alternative gases and expanding renewable energy, in addition to implementing practices such as recycling and reusing materials and properly handling hazardous and restricted substances. We expect to continue to maintain sufficient internal manufacturing capacity to meet the majority of our production needs and to obtain manufacturing equipment to support new technology developments and revenue growth. In 2022, we sourced about 80% of our total wafers and about 60% of our assembly/test production internally. With our planned capacity expansions, we expect these percentages to increase. To supplement our internal manufacturing capacity, we selectively use the capacity of outside suppliers, commonly known as foundries and subcontractors. Inventory Our objectives for inventory are to maintain high levels of customer service, maintain stable and competitive lead times, minimize inventory obsolescence and improve manufacturing asset utilization. To meet these objectives and to allow greater flexibility in periods of high demand, our strategy is to build ahead of demand our broad-based products that are used across a diverse set of applications and customers and have low risk of obsolescence. Inventory levels will vary based on market conditions and seasonality. As a result, we expect to increase our inventory levels over time. Raw materials We source materials, parts and supplies from a diverse set of suppliers globally. The materials, parts and supplies essential to our business are generally available, and we believe that such materials, parts and supplies will be available in the foreseeable future. Intellectual property We own many patents and have many patent applications pending in the United States and other countries in fields relating to our business. We have developed a strong, broad-based patent portfolio and continually add patents to that portfolio. We also have license agreements, which vary in duration, involving rights to our portfolio or those of other companies. We do not consider our business materially dependent upon any one patent or patent license. 7 Information about our executive officers The following is an alphabetical list of the names and ages of the executive officers of the company and the positions or offices with the company held by each person named: Name Age Position Ahmad S.

Risk factors You should read the following risk factors in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and in materials incorporated by reference into these filings. These risk factors are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to TI, a company with broad international operations. Like many companies, we are susceptible to a potential downturn associated with macroeconomic weakness, which may affect our performance and the performance of our customers. Similarly, the price of our securities is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions, actual financial results that do not meet our and/or the investment community’s expectations, changes in our and/or the investment community’s expectations for our future results, dividends or share repurchases, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Risks related to our business and industry Our global operations subject us to risks associated with domestic or international political, social, economic or other conditions. We have facilities in more than 30 countries. About 65% of our revenue comes from customers with headquarter locations outside the United States; revenue from end customers headquartered in China represents about 25% of our revenue. Alternatively, based on product shipment destination, about 90% of our revenue comes from products shipped to locations outside the United States. Certain countries where we operate have experienced, and other countries may experience, geopolitical tensions that affect global trade and macroeconomic conditions through the enactment of tariffs, import or export restrictions, trade embargoes and sanctions, restrictions on cross-border investment and other trade barriers. Geopolitical tensions may impact our ability to deliver products, support customers, receive manufacturing equipment or cause customers to seek alternate suppliers, which could adversely affect our operations and financial results. We are exposed to political, social and economic conditions (including inflation), security risks, acts of war, terrorism or other hostile acts, health conditions and epidemics, labor conditions, climate change risks and possible disruptions in transportation, communications and information technology networks of the various countries in which we operate. In addition, our global operations expose us to periods when the U.S. dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the non-U.S. currencies in which we transact business. The remeasurement of non-U.S. dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We face substantial competition that requires us to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressures. We face intense technological and pricing competition in the markets in which we operate. We expect this competition will continue to increase from large competitors and from small competitors serving niche markets, and also from emerging companies, particularly in Asia, that sell products into the same markets in which we operate. For example, we may face increased competition as a result of China actively promoting and reshaping its domestic semiconductor industry through policy changes and investment. These actions, in conjunction with trade tensions, may restrict us from participating in the China market or may prevent us from competing effectively. Certain competitors possess sufficient financial, technical and management resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably against our products, and consolidation among our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively. The price and product development pressures that result from competition may lead to reduced profit margins and lost business opportunities in the event that we are unable to match the price declines or cost efficiencies, or meet the technological, product, support, software or manufacturing advancements of our competitors. 9 Changes in expected demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our customers include companies in a wide range of end markets and sectors within those markets. If demand in one or more sectors within our end markets declines or the rate of growth slows, our results of operations may be adversely affected. The cyclical nature of the semiconductor market occasionally leads to significant and rapid increases and decreases in product demand. Additionally, the loss or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of our large customers, including curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers, the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustments, changes in demand for customer products, or trade restrictions, may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our results of operations also might suffer because of a general decline in customer demand resulting from, for example: uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets; natural events, epidemics or domestic or international political, social, economic or other conditions; breaches of customer information technology systems that disrupt customer operations; or a customer’s inability to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity. Our ability to match inventory and production with the product mix needed to fill orders may affect our ability to meet a quarter’s revenue forecast. We manufacture products with the intent to provide high levels of customer service. Our manufacturing forecasts are based on multiple assumptions, and if inaccurate, could cause us to hold inadequate, excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our operating results and our reputation could be adversely affected by cybersecurity events, breaches, disruptions or other incidents relating to our information technology systems. Breaches, disruptions or other incidents relating to our information technology systems or the systems of our customers, suppliers and other third parties could be caused by factors such as computer viruses, ransomware, malware, system failures, restricted network access, unauthorized access, terrorism, nation-state espionage, employee malfeasance, or human error. These events could, among other things, compromise our information technology networks; result in corrupt or lost data or the unauthorized release of our, our customers’ or our suppliers’ confidential or proprietary information; cause a disruption to our manufacturing and other operations; result in the release of personal data; or cause us to incur costs associated with increased protection, remediation, regulatory inquiries or penalties, or claims for damages, any of which could adversely affect our operating results and our reputation. Cybersecurity or other threats to our information technology systems or the systems of our customers, suppliers and other third parties are frequent, increasingly sophisticated and constantly evolving, thereby making them more difficult to detect, mitigate and defend against. Our ability to successfully implement strategic, business and organizational changes could affect our business plans and results of operations. From time to time, we undertake strategic, business and organizational changes, including acquisitions, divestitures, capital investments and restructuring actions, to support or carry out our objectives. If we do not successfully implement these changes, our business plans and operating results could be adversely affected. We may not achieve or sustain the expected growth, cost savings or other benefits of strategic, business and organizational changes, and charges associated with these actions could differ materially in amount and timing from our expectations. Our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we operate. We have manufacturing, data and design facilities and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather, geological events or epidemics that could disrupt operations. Climate change might exacerbate these occurrences or cause natural disasters to occur with greater frequency. A natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption, particularly where we have principal manufacturing and design operations, as listed in the Properties section in Item 2, may adversely affect our results and financial condition. 10 The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and related measures to curtail its spread have impacted, and may continue to impact, our operations across markets in which TI operates and those of our suppliers, customers and distributors. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to affect our business, results of operations and financial condition is difficult to predict and depends on numerous evolving factors including the duration and scope of the pandemic; government, social, business and other actions that have been and will be taken in response to the pandemic; appearance of new variants of COVID-19; the availability, adoption and efficacy of vaccines and treatments; and the effect of the pandemic on short- and long-term general economic conditions. We have experienced, and continue to experience, short- or long-term constrained supply or volatility in customer demand, which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results. Rapid technological change in markets we serve requires us to develop new technologies and products. Rapid technological change in markets we serve could contribute to shortened product life cycles and a decline in average selling prices of our products. Our results of operations depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop, manufacture and market innovative products in a timely and cost-effective manner. We make significant investments in research and development to improve existing technology and products, develop new products to meet changing customer demands, and improve our production processes. In some cases, we might not realize a return or the expected return on our investments because they are generally made before commercial viability can be assured. Further, projects that are commercially viable may not contribute to our operating results until at least a few years after they are completed. We face supply chain and manufacturing risks. We rely on third parties to supply us with goods and services in a cost-effective and timely manner. Our access to needed goods and services may be adversely affected by potential disputes with suppliers or disruptions in our own or suppliers’ operations as a result of, for example: quality excursions; uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets; domestic or international political, social, economic and other conditions; natural events or epidemics in the locations in which our suppliers operate; or limited or delayed access to and high costs of key materials, natural resources, services and utilities. Additionally, a breach or other incident relating to our suppliers’ information technology systems could result in a release of confidential or proprietary information. If our suppliers are unable to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity, we may be unable to obtain needed supplies, collect accounts receivable or access needed technology. In particular, our manufacturing processes and critical manufacturing equipment, and those of our suppliers, require that certain key materials, natural resources, services and utilities be available. Suppliers of these items have and might continue to extend lead times, limit supply or increase prices due to factors beyond our control. Limited or delayed access to and high costs of key materials, natural resources, services and utilities could adversely affect our results of operations. Our products contain materials that are subject to conflict minerals reporting requirements. Our relationships with customers and suppliers may be adversely affected if we are unable to describe our products as conflict-free. Additionally, our costs may increase if one or more of our customers demand that we change the sourcing of materials we cannot identify as conflict-free. Our inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect our results of operations. We have made and will continue to make significant investments in manufacturing capacity, and we might not realize our expected return on those investments. We subcontract a portion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our products, and we depend on third parties to provide advanced logic manufacturing process technology development. We do not have long-term contracts with all of these suppliers, and the number of alternate suppliers is limited. Reliance on these suppliers involves risks, including possible shortages of capacity in periods of high demand, suppliers’ inability to develop and deliver advanced logic manufacturing process technology in a timely, cost-effective, and appropriate manner, the possibility of suppliers’ imposition of increased costs on us and the unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property. 11 Our continued success depends in part on our ability to retain and recruit a sufficient number of qualified employees in a competitive environment. Our continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel, as well as the effective management of succession for key employees. Skilled and experienced personnel in our industry, including engineering, management, sales, technical and staff personnel, are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key engineering, management and technical personnel that we require to execute our business strategy. Our ability to recruit internationally or deploy employees to various locations may be limited by immigration laws and policies, including changes to, or the administration or interpretation of, those laws and policies. Our results of operations and our reputation could be affected by warranty claims, product liability claims, product recalls or legal proceedings. Claims based on warranty, product liability, epidemic or delivery failures, or other grounds relating to our products, software, manufacturing, services, designs, communications or cybersecurity could lead to significant expenses as we defend the claims or pay damage awards or settlements. In the event of a claim, we would also incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected customer or end consumer. Any such claims may also cause us to write off the value of related inventory. We maintain product liability insurance, but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims. In addition, it is possible for a customer to recall a product containing a TI part, for example, with respect to products used in automotive applications or handheld electronics, which may cause us to incur costs and expenses relating to the recall. Any of these events could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and reputation. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by distributors’ promotion of competing product lines or our distributors’ financial performance. In 2022, about 30% of our revenue was generated from sales of our products through distributors. Our distributors carry competing product lines, and our sales could be affected if semiconductor distributors promote competing products over our products. Moreover, our results of operations could be affected if our distributors suffer financial difficulties that result in their inability to pay amounts owed to us. Disputes with current or former distributors could be disruptive or harmful to our business. Our margins vary. Our profit margins vary due to a number of factors, which may include customer demand and shipment volume; capital expenditures and resulting depreciation; our manufacturing processes; product mix; inventory levels; tariffs; freight costs; and new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting practices or standards. In addition, we operate in a highly competitive market environment that might adversely affect pricing for our products. Because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating costs is fixed. With our planned capacity expansions, we expect capital expenditures and depreciation to increase. In general, these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or factory loadings, and can adversely affect profit margins as a result. Legal and regulatory risks Our operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject. We are subject to complex laws, rules and regulations on an international, national and local level that affect our domestic and international operations relating to, for example, the environment and climate change; safety; health; trade; bribery and corruption; financial reporting; tax; data privacy and protection; labor and employment; competition; facilities and code compliance; market access; epidemics; intellectual property ownership and infringement; and the movement of currency. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive and could restrict our ability to manufacture or ship our products and operate our business. If we do not comply or if we become subject to enforcement activity or government investigations, we could be subject to fines, penalties or other legal liability or disruptions to our operations. Furthermore, should these laws, rules and regulations be amended or expanded, or new ones enacted, we could incur materially greater compliance costs or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business. 12 Increased focus from government authorities, investors, customers and other key stakeholders on environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters has led to new and more stringent reporting standards and disclosure requirements. As the nature, scope and complexity of ESG reporting, diligence and disclosure requirements expand, we might have to undertake costly efforts to control, assess and report on ESG metrics. Some of these complex laws, rules and regulations – for example, those related to environmental, safety and health requirements – may particularly affect us in the jurisdictions in which we manufacture products, especially if such laws and regulations: require the use of abatement equipment beyond what we currently employ; require the addition or elimination of a material or process to or from our current manufacturing processes; or impose costs, fees or reporting requirements on the direct or indirect use of energy, natural resources, or materials or gases used or emitted into the environment in connection with the manufacture of our products. A substitute for a prohibited material or process might not be available, or might not be available at reasonable cost. Our results of operations could be affected by changes in tax-related matters. We have facilities in more than 30 countries and as a result are subject to taxation and audit by a number of taxing authorities. Tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate. If our tax rate increases, our results of operations could be adversely affected. A number of factors could cause our tax rate to increase, including a change in the jurisdictions in which our profits are earned and taxed; a change in the mix of profits from those jurisdictions; changes in available tax credits or deductions, including for amounts relating to stock compensation; changes in applicable tax rates; changes in tariff regulations or surcharges; changes in accounting principles; or adverse resolution of audits by taxing authorities. We have deferred tax assets on our balance sheet. Changes in applicable tax laws and regulations or in our business performance could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax assets, which could also affect our results of operations. In addition, we are subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction. These laws and regulations can be complex and subject to interpretation. Changes in these laws and regulations, including those that align with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting recommendations, could affect the locations where we are deemed to earn income, which could in turn affect our results of operations. Each quarter we forecast our tax expense based on our forecast of our performance for the year. If that performance forecast changes, our forecasted tax expense will change. Our performance depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights and to maintain freedom of operation. Access to worldwide markets depends in part on the continued strength of our intellectual property portfolio in all jurisdictions where we conduct business. There can be no assurance that, as our business evolves, we will obtain the necessary intellectual property rights, or that we will be able to independently develop the technology, software or know-how necessary to conduct our business or that we can do so without infringing the intellectual property rights of others. To the extent that we have to rely on technology from others for which a license is required, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such a license at all or on terms we consider reasonable. We, directly and indirectly, face infringement claims from third parties, including non-practicing entities that have acquired patents to pursue enforcement actions against other companies. We also face infringement claims where we or our customers make, use or sell products and where the intellectual property laws may be less established or less predictable. These assertions, whether or not of any merit, expose us to claims for damages and/or injunctions from third parties, as well as claims for indemnification by our customers in instances where we have a contractual or other legal obligation to indemnify them against damages resulting from infringement claims. We actively enforce and protect our own intellectual property rights. However, our efforts cannot prevent all misappropriation or improper use of our protected technology and information, including, for example, third parties’ use of our patented or copyrighted technology, or our trade secrets in their products without the right to do so, or third parties’ sale of counterfeit products bearing our trademark. The risk of unfair copying or cloning may impede our ability to sell our products. The laws of countries where we operate may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as U.S. laws. 13 Risks related to our financing activities and other risks Our debt could affect our operations and financial condition. From time to time, we issue debt securities with various interest rates and maturities. While we believe we will have the ability to service this debt, our ability to make principal and interest payments when due depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles, and business and other factors affecting our operations, including our other risk factors, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, our obligation to make principal and interest payments could divert funds that otherwise might be invested in our operations or returned to shareholders, or could cause us to raise funds by, for example, issuing new debt or equity or selling assets. Our results of operations and liquidity could be affected by changes in the financial markets. We maintain bank accounts, a portfolio of investments, access to one or more revolving credit agreements and the ability to issue debt to support the financing needs of the company. Our ability to fund our operations, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, service our debt obligations and meet our cash return objectives depends upon continuous access to our bank and investment accounts, and may depend on access to our bank credit lines that support commercial paper borrowings and provide additional liquidity through short-term bank loans. If we are unable to access these accounts and credit lines (for example, due to instability in the financial markets), our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected and our ability to access the capital markets or redeem our investments could be restricted. Material impairments of our goodwill could adversely affect our results of operations. We have a significant amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet. Charges associated with impairments of goodwill could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. ITEM 1B. Unresolved staff comments Not applicable. 14 ITEM 2.

No expiration date has been specified for these authorizations. ITEM 6. [Reserved] 16 ITEM 7. Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Overview We design and manufacture semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. Technology is the foundation of our company, but ultimately, our objective and the best metric for owners to measure our progress is through the growth of free cash flow per share over the long term. Our strategy to maximize long-term free cash flow per share growth has three elements: 1. A great business model that is focused on analog and embedded processing products and built around four sustainable competitive advantages. The four sustainable competitive advantages are powerful in combination and provide tangible benefits: (a) A strong foundation of manufacturing and technology that provides lower costs and greater control of our supply chain. (b) A broad portfolio of analog and embedded processing products that offers more opportunity per customer and more value for our investments. (c) The reach of our market channels that gives access to more customers and more of their design projects, leading to the opportunity to sell more of our products into each design and gives us better insight and knowledge of customer needs. (d) Diversity and longevity of our products, markets and customer positions that provide less single point dependency and longer returns on our investments. Together, these competitive advantages help position TI in a unique class of companies capable of generating and returning significant amounts of cash for our owners. We make our investments with an eye towards long-term strengthening and leveraging of these advantages. 2. Discipline in allocating capital to the best opportunities. This spans how we select R&D projects, develop new capabilities like TI.com, invest in new manufacturing capacity or how we think about acquisitions and returning cash to our owners. 3. Efficiency, which means constantly striving for more output for every dollar spent. We believe that our business model with the combined effect of our four competitive advantages sets TI apart from our peers and will for a long time to come. We will invest to strengthen our competitive advantages, be disciplined in capital allocation and stay diligent in our pursuit of efficiencies. Finally, we will remain focused on the belief that long-term growth of free cash flow per share is the ultimate measure to generate value. Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document. In the following discussion of our results of operations: • Our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels, and how management allocates resources and measures results. See Note 1 to the financial statements for more information regarding our segments. • When we discuss our results: ◦ Unless otherwise noted, changes in our revenue are attributable to changes in customer demand, which are evidenced by fluctuations in shipment volumes. ◦ New products do not tend to have a significant impact on our revenue in any given period because we sell such a large number of products. ◦ From time to time, our revenue and gross profit are affected by changes in demand for higher-priced or lower-priced products, which we refer to as changes in the “mix” of products shipped. 17 ◦ Because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed. When factory loadings decrease, our fixed costs are spread over reduced output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins decrease. Conversely, as factory loadings increase, our fixed costs are spread over increased output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins increase. • For an explanation of free cash flow, see the Non-GAAP financial information section. • All dollar amounts in the tables are stated in millions of U.S. dollars. Our results of operations provides details of our financial results for 2022 and 2021 and year-to-year comparisons between 2022 and 2021. Discussion of 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and its effects are impacting and will likely continue to impact market conditions and business operations across industries worldwide, including at TI. Therefore, we remain cautious about how the economy might behave for the next few years and continue to monitor potential impact on our operations. After a sustained period of growth, a market correction began in 2022. As a result, demand for our products weakened, and we expect this to continue into 2023. During this time, we will continue to manage our operating plan and expenses with a steady hand as we focus on long-term investments to strengthen our competitive advantages. Results of operations Our strategic focus is on analog and embedded processing products. We sell our products into six end markets: industrial, automotive, personal electronics, communications equipment, enterprise systems and other. While all of these end markets represent good opportunities, we place additional strategic emphasis on designing and selling our products into the industrial and automotive markets, which we believe represent the best long-term growth opportunities. Gross margin of 68.8% reflected the quality of our product portfolio, as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, including the benefit of 300-mm production. Our focus on analog and embedded processing allows us to generate strong cash flow from operations. Our cash flow from operations of $8.72 billion underscored the strength of our business model. Free cash flow was $5.92 billion and represented 29.6% of revenue. During 2022, we invested $3.37 billion in R&D and SG&A, invested $2.80 billion in capital expenditures and returned $7.91 billion to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. Details of financial results – 2022 compared with 2021 Revenue of $20.03 billion increased $1.68 billion, or 9.2%, due to higher revenue from Analog and, to a lesser extent, Embedded Processing. This increase benefited from higher prices and the mix of products shipped. Gross profit of $13.77 billion was up $1.40 billion, or 11.3%, primarily due to higher revenue. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit increased to 68.8% from 67.5%. Operating expenses (R&D and SG&A) were $3.37 billion compared with $3.22 billion, as a result of increased investments in R&D and inflation. Restructuring charges/other was $257 million compared with $54 million due to integration charges at our Lehi, Utah, manufacturing facility in both periods, which were partially offset by gains on sales of assets in 2021. The charges associated with our Lehi facility transitioned to cost of revenue once production began in December 2022. See Note 11 to the financial statements. Operating profit was $10.14 billion, or 50.6% of revenue, compared with $8.96 billion, or 48.8% of revenue. Other income and expense (OI&E) was $106 million of income compared with $143 million of income. See Note 11 to the financial statements. 18 Interest and debt expense of $214 million increased $30 million due to the issuance of additional long-term debt. See Note 8 to the financial statements. Our provision for income taxes was $1.28 billion compared with $1.15 billion. This increase was primarily due to higher income before income taxes and lower discrete tax benefits compared to 2021. Our effective tax rate, which includes discrete tax items, was 12.8% in 2022 compared with 12.9% in 2021. See Note 4 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to our effective tax rate. Net income was $8.75 billion compared with $7.77 billion. EPS was $9.41 compared with $8.26. Segment results – 2022 compared with 2021 Analog (includes Power and Signal Chain product lines) 2022 2021 Change Revenue $ 15,359 $ 14,050 9 % Operating profit 8,359 7,393 13 % Operating profit % of revenue 54.4 % 52.6 % Analog revenue increased in both product lines, led by Signal Chain. Operating profit increased primarily due to higher revenue and associated gross profit. Embedded Processing (includes microcontrollers and processors) 2022 2021 Change Revenue $ 3,261 $ 3,049 7 % Operating profit 1,253 1,174 7 % Operating profit % of revenue 38.4 % 38.5 % Embedded Processing revenue increased. Operating profit increased primarily due to higher revenue and associated gross profit. Other (includes DLP ® products, calculators and custom ASIC products) 2022 2021 Change Revenue $ 1,408 $ 1,245 13 % Operating profit * 528 393 34 % Operating profit % of revenue 37.5 % 31.6 % * Includes acquisition charges and restructuring charges/other Other revenue increased $163 million, and operating profit increased $135 million. Financial condition At the end of 2022, total cash (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments) was $9.07 billion, a decrease of $672 million from the end of 2021. Accounts receivable were $1.90 billion, an increase of $194 million compared with the end of 2021. Days sales outstanding at the end of 2022 were 37 compared with 32 at the end of 2021. Inventory was $2.76 billion, an increase of $847 million from the end of 2021. Days of inventory at the end of 2022 were 157 compared with 116 at the end of 2021. 19 Liquidity and capital resources Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations. Additional sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and access to debt markets. We also have a variable-rate, revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2022, our credit facility was undrawn, and we had no commercial paper outstanding. Cash flows from operating activities for 2022 were $8.72 billion, a decrease of $36 million due to higher cash used for working capital as we continued to strategically build our inventory, offset by higher net income. Investing activities for 2022 used $3.58 billion compared with $4.10 billion in 2021. Capital expenditures were $2.80 billion compared with $2.46 billion in 2021 and were primarily for semiconductor manufacturing equipment and facilities in both periods, including the purchase of our 300-mm semiconductor factory in Lehi, Utah, during 2021. Short-term investments used cash of $826 million in 2022 compared with $1.65 billion in 2021. As we continue to invest to strengthen our competitive advantage in manufacturing and technology as part of our long-term capacity planning, our capital expenditures are expected to be higher than historical levels. In August 2022, the U.S. government enacted the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act, which provides funding for manufacturing grants and research investments and establishes a 25% investment tax credit for certain investments in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing. We expect to receive the cash benefit associated with the investment tax credit for qualifying capital expenditures in future periods and to apply for other incentives provided by the legislation. Financing activities for 2022 used $6.72 billion compared with $3.14 billion in 2021. In 2022, we received net proceeds of $1.49 billion from the issuance of fixed-rate, long-term debt and retired maturing debt of $500 million. In 2021, we received net proceeds of $1.50 billion from the issuance of fixed-rate, long-term debt and retired maturing debt of $550 million. Dividends paid in 2022 were $4.30 billion compared with $3.89 billion in 2021, reflecting an increased dividend rate, partially offset by fewer shares outstanding. We used $3.62 billion to repurchase 22.2 million shares of our common stock compared with $527 million used in 2021 to repurchase 2.9 million shares. Employee exercises of stock options provided cash proceeds of $241 million compared with $377 million in 2021. We had $3.05 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $6.02 billion of short-term investments as of December 31, 2022. We believe we have the necessary financial resources and operating plans to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend and debt-related payments and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months. Non-GAAP financial information This MD&A includes references to free cash flow and ratios based on that measure. These are financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). Free cash flow was calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from the most directly comparable GAAP measure, cash flows from operating activities (also referred to as cash flow from operations). We believe that free cash flow and the associated ratios provide insight into our liquidity, our cash-generating capability and the amount of cash potentially available to return to shareholders, as well as insight into our financial performance. These non-GAAP measures are supplemental to the comparable GAAP measures. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in the table below. For Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Cash flow from operations (GAAP) $ 8,720 $ 8,756 Capital expenditures (2,797) (2,462) Free cash flow (non-GAAP) $ 5,923 $ 6,294 Revenue $ 20,028 $ 18,344 Cash flow from operations as a percentage of revenue (GAAP) 43.5 % 47.7 % Free cash flow as a percentage of revenue (non-GAAP) 29.6 % 34.3 % 20 Critical accounting estimates Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements. As disclosed in Note 2, the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Management believes it is unlikely that applying other estimates and assumptions would have a material impact on the financial statements. We consider the following accounting policies to be those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and that require a higher degree of judgment. Income taxes In determining net income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax provisions and the resultant tax liabilities and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In the ordinary course of global business, there may be many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. The calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the interpretation and application of complex tax laws, and significant judgment is necessary to (i) determine whether, based on the technical merits, a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and (ii) measure the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. Although we believe the estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different from what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals. As part of our financial process, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered. If recovery is not likely, the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are estimated not to be ultimately recoverable. Our judgment regarding future recoverability of our deferred tax assets may change due to various factors, including changes in U.S. or international tax laws and changes in market conditions and their impact on our assessment of taxable income in future periods. These changes, if any, may require adjustments to the valuation allowances and an accompanying reduction or increase in net income in the period when such determinations are made. Inventory valuation allowances Inventory is valued net of allowances for unsalable or obsolete raw materials, work in process and finished goods. Statistical allowances are determined quarterly for raw materials and work in process based on historical disposals of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons. For finished goods, quarterly statistical allowances are determined by comparing inventory levels of individual parts to historical shipments, current backlog and estimated future sales in order to identify inventory considered unlikely to be sold. A specific allowance for each material type will be carried if there is a significant event not captured by the statistical allowance, such as an end-of-life part or demand with imminent risk of cancellation. Allowances are also calculated quarterly for instances where inventoried costs for individual products are in excess of the net realizable value for those products. Actual future write-offs of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons may differ from estimates and calculations used to determine valuation allowances due to changes in customer demand, customer negotiations, technology shifts and other factors. Commitments and contingencies See Note 10 to the financial statements for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies. 21 ITEM 7A. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk Foreign exchange risk The U.S. dollar is our functional currency for financial reporting. Our non-U.S. entities own assets or liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars or other currencies, and exchange rate fluctuations in those jurisdictions may impact our effective tax rate. Our balance sheet also reflects amounts remeasured from non-U.S. dollar currencies. Because most of the aggregate non-U.S. dollar balance sheet exposure is hedged by forward currency exchange contracts, which are based on year-end 2022 balances and currency exchange rates, a hypothetical 10% plus or minus fluctuation in non-U.S. currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar would result in a pretax currency exchange gain or loss of approximately $3 million. We use these forward currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings impact that exchange rate fluctuations may have on our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures. As of December 31, 2022, we had forward currency exchange contracts outstanding with a notional value of $387 million to hedge net balance sheet exposures (including $118 million to sell Japanese yen, $78 million to sell British pounds and $49 million to buy Chinese yuan). Similar hedging activities existed at year-end 2021. Interest rate risk We have the following potential exposure to changes in interest rates: (i) the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and short-term investments, which could produce a gain or a loss; and (ii) the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our debt. As of December 31, 2022, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and short-term investments by about $15 million and decrease the fair value of our long-term debt by $566 million. Because interest rates on our long-term debt are fixed, changes in interest rates would not affect the cash flows associated with long-term debt. Equity risk Long-term investments at year-end 2022 include the following: • Investments in mutual funds – includes mutual funds that were selected to generate returns that offset changes in certain liabilities related to deferred compensation arrangements. The mutual funds hold a variety of debt and equity investments. • Investments in venture capital funds – includes investments in limited partnerships (accounted for under either the equity method or at cost with adjustments to observable market changes or impairments). • Equity investments – includes non-marketable (non-publicly traded) equity securities. Investments in mutual funds are stated at fair value. Changes in prices of the mutual fund investments are expected to offset related changes in certain deferred compensation liabilities. Non-marketable equity securities and certain venture capital funds are stated at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes. Investments in the remaining venture capital funds are stated using the equity method. See Note 6 to the financial statements for details of equity and other long-term investments. We also utilize total return swaps to economically hedge exposure to changes in liabilities related to the market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements with employees. Gains or losses from changes in the fair value of these total return swaps generally offset the related losses or gains on the deferred compensation liabilities. 22 ITEM 8.

Description of business, including segment and geographic area information We design and manufacture semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. We have two reportable segments, Analog and Embedded Processing, each of which represents groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels. Our segments also reflect how management allocates resources and measures results. • Analog semiconductors change real-world signals, such as sound, temperature, pressure or images, by conditioning them, amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors. Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in all electronic equipment by converting, distributing, storing, discharging, isolating and measuring electrical energy, whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or using a battery. Our Analog segment consists of two major product lines: Power and Signal Chain. • Embedded Processing products are the digital “brains” of many types of electronic equipment. They are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for various combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application. We report the results of our remaining business activities in Other. Other includes operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for individually reportable segments and cannot be aggregated with other operating segments. Other includes DLP ® products, calculators and custom ASIC products. In Other, we also include items that are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments. Examples of these items include acquisition, integration and restructuring charges (see Note 11); and certain corporate-level items, such as litigation expenses, environmental costs, insurance settlements, and gains and losses from other activities, including asset dispositions. We allocate the remainder of our expenses associated with corporate activities to our operating segments based on specific methodologies, such as percentage of operating expenses or headcount. Our centralized manufacturing and support organizations, such as facilities, procurement and logistics, provide support to our operating segments, including those in Other. Costs incurred by these organizations, including depreciation, are charged to the segments on a per-unit basis. Consequently, depreciation expense is not an independently identifiable component within the segments’ results and, therefore, is not provided. With the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segment, nor does the chief operating decision maker evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information. We have no material intersegment revenue. The accounting policies of the segments are consistent with those described in the summary of significant accounting policies and practices. 29 Segment information For Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Revenue: Analog $ 15,359 $ 14,050 $ 10,886 Embedded Processing 3,261 3,049 2,570 Other 1,408 1,245 1,005 Total revenue $ 20,028 $ 18,344 $ 14,461 Operating profit: Analog $ 8,359 $ 7,393 $ 4,912 Embedded Processing 1,253 1,174 743 Other 528 393 239 Total operating profit $ 10,140 $ 8,960 $ 5,894 Geographic area information The following geographic information is based on product shipment destination, which does not reflect end demand by geography.

No end customer accounted for 10% or more of revenue in 2022 or 2021. 2. Basis of presentation and significant accounting policies and practices Basis of presentation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). The basis of these financial statements is comparable for all periods presented herein. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. All dollar and share amounts in the financial statements and tables in these notes, except per-share amounts, are presented in millions unless otherwise indicated. We have reclassified certain amounts in the prior periods’ financial statements to conform to the 2022 presentation. The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates from which final results may vary. Significant accounting policies and practices Revenue recognition We generate revenue primarily from the sale of semiconductor products, either directly to a customer or to a distributor, and recognize revenue when control is transferred. Control is considered transferred when title and risk of loss pass, when the customer becomes obligated to pay and, where required, when the customer has accepted the products. This transfer generally occurs at a point in time upon shipment or delivery to the customer or distributor, depending upon the terms of the sales order. Payment for sales to customers and distributors is generally due on our standard commercial terms. For sales to distributors, payment is not contingent upon resale of the products. Revenue from sales of our products that are subject to inventory consignment agreements is recognized at a point in time, when the customer or distributor pulls product from consignment inventory that we store at designated locations. Delivery and transfer of control occur at that point, when title and risk of loss transfers and the customer or distributor becomes obligated to pay for the products pulled from inventory. Until the products are pulled for use or sale by the customer or distributor, we retain control over the products’ disposition, including the right to pull back or relocate the products. The revenue recognized is adjusted based on allowances, which are prepared on a portfolio basis using a most likely amount methodology based on analysis of historical data and contractual terms. These allowances, which are not material, generally include adjustments for pricing arrangements, product returns , incentives and credit losses. We recognize shipping fees received from customers, if any, in revenue. We include the related shipping and handling costs in cost of revenue. The majority of our customers pay these fees directly to third parties. 31 Advertising costs We expense advertising and other promotional costs as incurred. This expense was $ 27 million, $ 27 million and $ 28 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Income taxes We account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach. We record the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences related to events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns. We record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Other assessed taxes Some transactions require us to collect taxes such as sales, value-added and excise taxes from our customers. These transactions are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Income on a net (excluded from revenue) basis. Leases We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Leases are included in other long-term assets, accrued expenses and other liabilities, and other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Lease assets represent our right to use underlying assets for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligations to make lease payments over the lease term. On the commencement date, leases are evaluated for classification, and assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. We use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement in determining the present value of lease payments. Operating lease expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Our lease values include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options. We have agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for as a single lease component. Leases with an initial lease term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; we recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Earnings per share (EPS) We use the two-class method for calculating EPS because the restricted stock units (RSUs) we grant are participating securities containing non-forfeitable rights to receive dividend equivalents. Under the two-class method, a portion of net income is allocated to RSUs and excluded from the calculation of income allocated to common stock. 32 Computation and reconciliation of earnings per common share are as follows: For Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Net Income Shares EPS Net Income Shares EPS Net Income Shares EPS Basic EPS: Net income $ 8,749 $ 7,769 $ 5,595 Income allocated to RSUs ( 40 ) ( 33 ) ( 27 ) Income allocated to common stock $ 8,709 916 $ 9.51 $ 7,736 923 $ 8.38 $ 5,568 921 $ 6.05 Dilutive effect of stock compensation plans 10 13 12 Diluted EPS: Net income $ 8,749 $ 7,769 $ 5,595 Income allocated to RSUs ( 39 ) ( 33 ) ( 27 ) Income allocated to common stock $ 8,710 926 $ 9.41 $ 7,736 936 $ 8.26 $ 5,568 933 $ 5.97 Potentially dilutive securities representing 5 million, 3 million and 4 million shares of common stock that were outstanding in 2022, 2021 and 2020 respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per common share during these periods because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. Investments We present investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as cash equivalents, short-term investments or other long-term assets. See Note 6 for additional information. • Cash equivalents and short-term investments – The primary objectives of our cash equivalent and short-term investment activities are to preserve capital and maintain liquidity while generating appropriate returns. We consider investments in available-for-sale debt securities with maturities of 90 days or less from the date of our investment to be cash equivalents. We consider investments in available-for-sale debt securities with maturities beyond 90 days from the date of our investment as being available for use in current operations and include them in short-term investments. • Other long-term assets – Long-term investments, which are included within other long-term assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, consist of mutual funds, venture capital funds and non-marketable securities. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. Cost is generally computed on a currently adjusted standard cost basis, which approximates cost on a first-in, first-out basis. Standard cost is based on the normal utilization of installed factory capacity. Cost associated with underutilization of capacity is expensed as incurred. Inventory held at consignment locations is included in our finished goods inventory. We review inventory quarterly for salability and obsolescence. A statistical allowance is provided for inventory considered unlikely to be sold. The statistical allowance is based on an analysis of historical disposal activity, historical customer shipments, as well as estimated future sales. A specific allowance for each material type will be carried if there is a significant event not captured by the statistical allowance. We write off inventory in the period in which disposal occurs. Government incentives Incentives provided by government entities are recognized when we have reasonable assurance that we will comply with the conditions of the incentive, if any, and the incentive will be received. Incentives related to the acquisition or construction of fixed assets are recognized as a reduction in the carrying amounts of the related assets and reduce depreciation expense over the useful lives of the assets. Incentives for specific operating activities are offset against the related expense in the period the expense is incurred. 33 In August 2022, the U.S. government enacted the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act, which provides funding for manufacturing grants and research investments, and it establishes a 25% investment tax credit for certain investments in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing. As of December 31, 2022, we have recognized $ 395 million of receivables in other long-term assets with a corresponding reduction to the carrying amounts of the qualifying manufacturing assets. Property, plant and equipment; acquisition-related intangibles; and other capitalized costs Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Our cost basis includes certain assets acquired in business combinations that were initially recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the improvements. We amortize acquisition-related intangibles on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life of the assets. Capitalized software licenses are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the license. Fully depreciated or amortized assets are written off against accumulated depreciation or amortization. Impairments of long-lived assets We regularly review whether facts or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying values of property, plant and equipment or other long-lived assets, including intangible assets, are impaired. We assess the recoverability of assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with those assets to their respective carrying amounts. Any impairment charge is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. Fair value is determined by available market valuations, if applicable, or by discounted cash flows. Goodwill Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if certain impairment indicators arise. We perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, including goodwill. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, or if we elect not to use the qualitative assessment, then we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. See Note 11 for additional information. Foreign currency The functional currency for our non-U.S. subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Accounts recorded in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are remeasured into the functional currency. Current assets (except inventories), deferred taxes, other long-term assets, current liabilities and long-term liabilities are remeasured at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period. Property, plant and equipment with associated depreciation and inventories are valued at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expense accounts other than depreciation for each month are calculated at the appropriate daily rate of exchange. Currency exchange gains and losses from remeasurement are credited or charged to OI&E. Derivatives and hedging We use derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to foreign exchange risk. These instruments are primarily forward foreign currency exchange contracts, which are used as economic hedges to reduce the earnings impact that exchange rate fluctuations may have on our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures. Gains and losses from changes in the fair value of these forward foreign currency exchange contracts are credited or charged to OI&E. We do not apply hedge accounting to our foreign currency derivative instruments. We are exposed to variability in compensation charges related to certain deferred compensation obligations to employees. We use total return swaps to economically hedge this exposure and offset the related compensation expense, recognizing changes in the value of the swaps and the related deferred compensation liabilities in SG&A. In connection with the issuance of long-term debt, we may use financial derivatives such as treasury-rate lock agreements that are recognized in AOCI and amortized over the life of the related debt. The results of these derivative transactions were not material. We do not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. 34 3. Stock compensation We have stock options outstanding to participants under long-term incentive plans. The option price per share may not be less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of the grant. The options have a 10 -year term, generally vest ratably over four years and continue to vest after the option recipient retires. We also have RSUs outstanding to participants under long-term incentive plans. Each RSU represents the right to receive one share of TI common stock, issued on the vesting date, which is generally four years after the date of grant. RSUs continue to vest after the recipient retires. Holders of RSUs receive an annual cash payment equivalent to the dividends paid on our common stock. The fair value per share of RSUs is generally determined based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. We have options and RSUs outstanding to non-employee directors under director compensation plans. The plans generally provide for annual grants of stock options and RSUs, a one-time grant of RSUs to each new non-employee director and the issuance of TI common stock upon the distribution of stock units credited to director deferred compensation accounts. We also have an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) under which options are offered to all eligible employees in amounts based on a percentage of the employee’s compensation, subject to a cap. Under the plan, the option price per share is 85 % of the fair market value on the exercise date. As of December 31, 2022, 32 million shares remain available for future issuance under this plan. Total stock compensation expense recognized is as follows: For Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 COR $ 34 $ 21 $ 21 R&D 90 67 68 SG&A 165 134 135 Restructuring charges/other — 8 — Total $ 289 $ 230 $ 224 These amounts include expenses related to non-qualified stock options, RSUs and stock options offered under our ESPP and are net of estimated forfeitures. We recognize compensation expense for non-qualified stock options and RSUs on a straight-line basis over the minimum service period required for vesting of the award, adjusting for estimated forfeitures based on historical activity. Awards issued to employees who are retirement eligible or nearing retirement eligibility are expensed on an accelerated basis. Options issued under our ESPP are expensed over a three-month period. As of December 31, 2022, total future compensation related to equity awards not yet recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Income was $ 440 million, which we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of 1.9 years. 35 Fair value methods and assumptions We account for all awards granted under our various stock compensation plans at fair value. We estimate the fair values for non-qualified stock options using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: For Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Weighted average grant date fair value, per share $ 39.94 $ 40.78 $ 25.55 Weighted average assumptions used: Expected volatility 29 % 32 % 26 % Expected lives (in years) 6.4 6.7 6.8 Risk-free interest rates 1.83 % 0.72 % 1.53 % Expected dividend yields 2.64 % 2.41 % 2.76 % We use market-based measures of implied volatility to determine expected volatility on all options granted. We determine expected lives of options based on the historical option exercise experience of our option holders using a rolling 10-year average. Expected dividend yields are based on the annualized approved quarterly dividend rate and the current market price of our common stock at the time of grant. No assumption for a future dividend rate change is included unless there is an approved plan to change the dividend in the near term. Long-term incentive and director compensation plans Stock option and RSU transactions under our long-term incentive and director compensation plans are as follows: Stock Options RSUs Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price per Share Shares Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value per Share Outstanding grants, December 31, 2021 25 $ 91.58 4 $ 124.80 Granted 4 $ 174.60 2 $ 174.39 Stock options exercised/RSUs vested ( 4 ) $ 67.64 ( 1 ) $ 112.87 Outstanding grants, December 31, 2022 (a) 25 $ 105.75 5 $ 147.30 (a) Forfeited and expired shares were not material. For Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Weighted average grant date fair value per share for RSUs $ 174.39 $ 176.08 $ 130.59 Total grant date fair value of shares vested for RSUs $ 121 $ 115 $ 110 Aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised $ 336 $ 611 $ 681 As of December 31, 2022, 32 million shares remain available for future issuance under these plans. Summarized information about stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2022, is as follows: Stock Options Outstanding Exercise Price Range Number Outstanding (Shares) Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Life (Years) $ 32.48 to $ 193.58 25 5.3 36 Options Fully Vested and Expected to Vest (a) Options Exercisable Options outstanding (shares) 25 17 Weighted average remaining contractual life (in years) 5.3 4.0 Weighted average exercise price per share $ 105.25 $ 81.56 Intrinsic value (billions) $ 1.54 $ 1.42 (a) Includes effects of expected forfeitures. Excluding the effects of expected forfeitures, the aggregate intrinsic value of stock options outstanding was $ 1.54 billion. Effect on shares outstanding and treasury shares Treasury shares were acquired in connection with the board-authorized stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2022, $ 21.48 billion of stock repurchase authorizations remain, and no expiration date has been specified. Our practice is to issue shares of common stock from treasury shares upon exercise of stock options, distribution of director deferred compensation and vesting of RSUs. The following table reflects the changes in our treasury shares: For Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Balance, January 1 817 821 809 Repurchases 22 3 23 Shares issued ( 4 ) ( 7 ) ( 11 ) Balance, December 31 835 817 821 The effects on cash flows are as follows: For Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Proceeds from common stock transactions (a) $ 241 $ 377 $ 470 Tax benefit realized from stock compensation 110 175 195 (a) Net of taxes paid for employee shares withheld of $ 50 million, $ 53 million and $ 53 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 4. Income taxes Income before income taxes is comprised of the following components: For Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 U.S. $ 9,122 $ 7,998 $ 5,210 Non-U.S. 910 921 807 Total $ 10,032 $ 8,919 $ 6,017 37 Provision for income taxes is comprised of the following components: For Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Current Deferred Total Current Deferred Total Current Deferred Total U.S. federal $ 1,235 $ ( 223 ) $ 1,012 $ 948 $ ( 23 ) $ 925 $ 357 $ ( 122 ) $ 235 Non-U.S. 212 32 244 169 38 207 192 ( 15 ) 177 U.S. state 27 — 27 18 — 18 10 — 10 Total $ 1,474 $ ( 191 ) $ 1,283 $ 1,135 $ 15 $ 1,150 $ 559 $ ( 137 ) $ 422 Principal reconciling items from the U.S. statutory income tax rate to the effective tax rate (provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes) are as follows: For Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 U.S. statutory income tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 % Foreign derived intangible income ( 7.0 ) ( 6.1 ) ( 6.1 ) R&D tax credit ( 0.9 ) ( 0.9 ) ( 1.3 ) Stock compensation ( 0.7 ) ( 1.5 ) ( 2.5 ) Changes in uncertain tax positions 0.1 ( 0.2 ) ( 4.0 ) Other 0.3 0.6 ( 0.1 ) Effective tax rate 12.8 % 12.9 % 7.0 % On August 16, 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act, which introduces a new 15% corporate minimum tax based on adjusted financial statement income effective January 1, 2023, and provisions intended to mitigate climate change, including tax credit incentives for investments that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Based on our current analysis of the provisions, this legislation will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The earnings represented by non-cash operating assets, such as fixed assets and inventory, will continue to be permanently reinvested outside the United States. Provisions of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act), such as the one-time tax on indefinitely reinvested earnings and the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) tax for years beginning in 2018, eliminate any additional U.S. taxation resulting from repatriation of earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries to the United States. Consequently, no U.S. tax provision has been made for the future remittance of these earnings. However, withholding or distribution taxes in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions will be incurred upon repatriation of available cash to the United States. A provision has been made for deferred taxes on these undistributed earnings to the extent that repatriation of the available cash to the United States is expected to result in a tax liability. As of December 31, 2022, we have no basis differences that would result in material unrecognized deferred tax liabilities. We have made an allowable policy election to account for the effects of GILTI as a component of income tax expense in the period in which the tax is incurred. 38 The primary components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows: December 31, 2022 2021 Deferred tax assets: Capitalized R&D $ 380 $ — Deferred loss and tax credit carryforwards 201 207 Accrued expenses 182 209 Stock compensation 132 110 Inventories and related reserves 88 74 Retirement costs for defined benefit and retiree health care 43 — Other 36 40 Total deferred tax assets, before valuation allowance 1,062 640 Valuation allowance ( 189 ) ( 188 ) Total deferred tax assets, after valuation allowance 873 452 Deferred tax liabilities: Property, plant and equipment ( 410 ) ( 197 ) International earnings ( 35 ) ( 38 ) Retirement costs for defined benefit and retiree health care — ( 15 ) Acquisition-related intangibles and fair-value adjustments ( 13 ) ( 12 ) Other ( 8 ) ( 14 ) Total deferred tax liabilities ( 466 ) ( 276 ) Net deferred tax asset $ 407 $ 176 The deferred tax assets and liabilities based on tax jurisdictions are presented on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows: December 31, 2022 2021 Deferred tax assets $ 473 $ 263 Deferred tax liabilities ( 66 ) ( 87 ) Net deferred tax asset $ 407 $ 176 We make an ongoing assessment regarding the realization of U.S. and non-U.S. deferred tax assets. This assessment is based on our evaluation of relevant criteria, including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets, taxable income in prior carryback years and expectations for future taxable income. Valuation allowances increased $ 1 million in 2022, increased $ 9 million in 2021 and decreased $ 1 million in 2020. These changes had no impact to net income in 2022, 2021 or 2020. We have no material tax loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2022. Cash payments made for income taxes, net of refunds, were $ 1.48 billion, $ 1.20 billion and $ 720 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Uncertain tax positions We operate in a number of tax jurisdictions, and our income tax returns are subject to examination by tax authorities in those jurisdictions who may challenge any item on these tax returns. Because the matters challenged by authorities are typically complex, their ultimate outcome is uncertain. Before any benefit can be recorded in our financial statements, we must determine that it is “more likely than not” that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate tax authorities. We recognize accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions and penalties as components of OI&E. 39 The changes in the total amounts of uncertain tax positions are as follows: 2022 2021 2020 Balance, January 1 $ 69 $ 89 $ 303 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 3 2 3 Additions for tax positions of prior years 10 7 35 Reductions for tax positions of prior years — ( 6 ) ( 249 ) Settlements with tax authorities — ( 23 ) — Expiration of the statute of limitations for assessing taxes — — ( 3 ) Balance, December 31 $ 82 $ 69 $ 89 Interest income (expense) recognized in the year ended December 31 $ ( 1 ) $ ( 5 ) $ 39 Interest payable as of December 31 $ 3 $ 13 $ 8 The liability for uncertain tax positions is a component of other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. All of the $ 82 million and $ 69 million liabilities for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, are comprised of positions that, if recognized, would lower the effective tax rate. If these liabilities are ultimately realized, no existing deferred tax assets in 2022 or 2021 would also be realized. Reductions for tax positions of prior years in 2020 include a $ 249 million tax benefit for the effective settlement of a depreciation-related uncertain tax position. Accrued interest of $ 46 million related to this uncertain tax position was reversed and included in OI&E. As of December 31, 2022, the statute of limitations remains open for U.S. federal tax returns for 2017 and following years. Certain tax treaty procedures for relief from double taxation remain pending for U.S. federal tax returns for the years 2015 through 2021. In non-U.S. jurisdictions, the years open to audit represent the years still open under the statute of limitations. With respect to major jurisdictions outside the United States, our subsidiaries are no longer subject to income tax audits for years before 2012. 5. Financial instruments and risk concentration Financial instruments We hold derivative financial instruments such as forward foreign currency exchange contracts, the fair value of which was not material as of December 31, 2022. Our forward foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2022, had a notional value of $ 387 million to hedge our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures, including $ 118 million to sell Japanese yen, $ 78 million to sell British pounds and $ 49 million to buy Chinese yuan. Our investments in cash equivalents, short-term investments and certain long-term investments, as well as our deferred compensation liabilities, are carried at fair value. Our postretirement plan assets are carried at fair value or net asset value per share. The carrying values for other current financial assets and liabilities, such as accounts receivable and accounts payable, approximate fair value due to the short maturity of such instruments. As of December 31, 2022, the carrying value of long-term debt, including the current portion, was $ 8.74 billion, and the estimated fair value was $ 7.86 billion. The estimated fair value is measured using broker-dealer quotes, which are Level 2 inputs. See Note 6 for a description of fair value and the definition of Level 2 inputs. 40 Risk concentration We are subject to counterparty risks from financial institutions, customers and issuers of debt securities. Financial instruments that could subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash deposits, cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable. To manage our credit risk exposure, we place cash investments in investment-grade debt securities and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. We also limit counterparties on cash deposits and financial derivative contracts to financial institutions with investment-grade ratings. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across different industries and geographic areas. We maintain allowances for expected returns, disputes, adjustments, incentives and credit losses. These allowances are deducted from accounts receivable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accounts receivable allowances changed to reflect amounts charged (credited) to operating results by $ 5 million, ($ 3 ) million and $ 3 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 6. Valuation of debt and equity investments and certain liabilities Investments measured at fair value Money market funds, debt investments and mutual funds are stated at fair value, which is generally based on market prices or broker quotes. We classify all debt investments as available-for-sale. See Fair-value considerations. Unrealized gains and losses are recorded as an increase or decrease, net of taxes, in AOCI on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and any credit losses are recorded as an allowance for credit losses with an offset recognized in OI&E in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Our mutual funds hold a variety of debt and equity investments intended to generate returns that offset changes in certain deferred compensation liabilities. We record changes in the fair value of these mutual funds and the related deferred compensation liabilities in SG&A. Other investments Our other investments include equity-method investments and non-marketable investments, which are not measured at fair value. These investments consist of interests in venture capital funds and other non-marketable securities. Gains and losses from equity-method investments are recognized in OI&E based on our ownership share of the investee’s financial results. Non-marketable securities are measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments. Gains and losses on non-marketable investments are recognized in OI&E. 41 Details of our investments are as follows: December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Cash and Cash Equivalents Short-Term Investments Long-Term Investments Cash and Cash Equivalents Short-Term Investments Long-Term Investments Measured at fair value: Money market funds $ 1,238 $ — $ — $ 1,824 $ — $ — Corporate obligations 276 1,535 — 1,060 1,070 — U.S. government and agency securities 680 4,234 — 642 3,388 — Non-U.S. government and agency securities 149 248 — 300 650 — Mutual funds — — 11 — — 16 Total 2,343 6,017 11 3,826 5,108 16 Other measurement basis: Equity-method investments — — 18 — — 42 Non-marketable investments — — 5 — — 4 Cash on hand 707 — — 805 — — Total $ 3,050 $ 6,017 $ 34 $ 4,631 $ 5,108 $ 62 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, unrealized gains and losses associated with our debt investments were not material. We did no t recognize any credit losses related to debt investments in 2022, 2021 or 2020. The following table presents the aggregate maturities of our debt investments as of December 31, 2022: Fair Value One year or less $ 7,049 One to two years 73 In 2022, 2021 and 2020, the proceeds from sales, redemptions and maturities of short-term debt investments were $ 13.66 billion, $ 8.48 billion and $ 5.29 billion, respectively. Gross realized gains and losses from these sales were not material. In 2020, we entered into total return swaps to economically hedge the variability of certain deferred compensation obligations to employees. As a result, in 2020, we received proceeds of $ 253 million from the sale of investments in mutual funds that were previously being utilized to offset this exposure. Fair-value considerations We measure and report certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The three-level hierarchy described below indicates the extent and level of judgment used to estimate fair-value measurements. • Level 1 – Uses unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. 42 • Level 2 – Uses inputs other than Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date through correlation with market data, including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and quoted prices in markets that are not active. Level 2 also includes assets and liabilities that are valued using models or other pricing methodologies that do not require significant judgment since the input assumptions used in the models, such as interest rates and volatility factors, are corroborated by readily observable data. We utilize a third-party data service to provide Level 2 valuations. We verify these valuations for reasonableness relative to unadjusted quotes obtained from brokers or dealers based on observable prices for similar assets in active markets. • Level 3 – Uses inputs that are unobservable, supported by little or no market activity and reflect the use of significant management judgment. These values are generally determined using pricing models that utilize management estimates of market participant assumptions. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had no Level 3 assets or liabilities. The following are our assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis. These tables do not include cash on hand, assets held by our postretirement plans, or assets and liabilities that are measured at historical cost or any basis other than fair value. December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Level 1 Level 2 Total Level 1 Level 2 Total Assets: Money market funds $ 1,238 $ — $ 1,238 $ 1,824 $ — $ 1,824 Corporate obligations — 1,811 1,811 — 2,130 2,130 U.S. government and agency securities 4,914 — 4,914 3,629 401 4,030 Non-U.S. government and agency securities — 397 397 — 950 950 Mutual funds 11 — 11 16 — 16 Total assets $ 6,163 $ 2,208 $ 8,371 $ 5,469 $ 3,481 $ 8,950 Liabilities: Deferred compensation $ 326 $ — $ 326 $ 395 $ — $ 395 Total liabilities $ 326 $ — $ 326 $ 395 $ — $ 395 7. Postretirement benefit plans Plan descriptions We have various employee retirement plans, including defined contribution, defined benefit and retiree health care benefit plans. For qualifying employees, we offer deferred compensation arrangements. U.S. retirement plans Our principal retirement plans in the United States are a defined contribution plan, an enhanced defined contribution plan and qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans. The defined benefit plans were closed to new participants in 1997, and then current participants were allowed to make a one-time election to continue accruing a benefit in the plans or to cease accruing a benefit and instead to participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan. Both defined contribution plans offer an employer-matching savings option that allows employees to make pretax and post-tax contributions to various investment choices. Employees who elected to continue accruing a benefit in the qualified defined benefit pension plans may also participate in the defined contribution plan, where employer-matching contributions are provided for up to 2 % of the employee’s annual eligible earnings. Employees who elected not to continue accruing a benefit in the defined benefit pension plans and employees hired after November 1997 and through December 31, 2003, may participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan. This plan provides for a fixed employer contribution of 2 % of the employee’s annual eligible earnings, plus an employer-matching contribution of up to 4 % of the employee’s annual eligible earnings. Employees hired after December 31, 2003, do not receive the fixed employer contribution of 2 % of the employee’s annual eligible earnings. 43 As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, as a result of employees’ elections, TI’s U.S. defined contribution plans held shares of TI common stock totaling 6 million shares in both periods valued at $ 940 million and $ 1.16 billion, respectively. Dividends paid on these shares in 2022 and 2021 were $ 28 million and $ 27 million, respectively. Effective April 1, 2016, the TI common stock fund was frozen to new contributions or transfers into the fund. Our aggregate expense for the U.S. defined contribution plans was $ 70 million in 2022, $ 63 million in 2021 and $ 61 million in 2020. The defined benefit pension plans include employees still accruing benefits, as well as employees and participants who no longer accrue service-related benefits, but instead, may participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan. Benefits under the qualified defined benefit pension plan are determined using a formula based on years of service and the highest five consecutive years of compensation. We intend to contribute amounts to this plan to meet the minimum funding requirements of applicable local laws and regulations, plus such additional amounts as we deem appropriate. The non-qualified defined benefit plans are unfunded and closed to new participants. U.S. retiree health care benefit plan U.S. employees who meet eligibility requirements are offered medical coverage during retirement. We make a contribution toward the cost of those retiree medical benefits for certain retirees and their dependents. The contribution rates are based upon various factors, the most important of which are an employee’s date of hire, date of retirement, years of service and eligibility for Medicare benefits. The balance of the cost is borne by the plan’s participants. Employees hired after January 1, 2001, are responsible for the full cost of their medical benefits during retirement. Non-U.S. retirement plans We provide retirement coverage for non-U.S. employees, as required by local laws or to the extent we deem appropriate, through a number of defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Retirement benefits are generally based on an employee’s years of service and compensation. Funding requirements are determined on an individual country and plan basis and are subject to local country practices and market circumstances. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, as a result of employees’ elections, TI’s non-U.S. defined contribution plans held TI common stock valued at $ 33 million and $ 38 million, respectively. Dividends paid on these shares of TI common stock in 2022 and 2021 were not material. Effects on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Balance Sheets Expenses related to defined benefit and retiree health care benefit plans are as follows: U.S. Defined Benefit U.S. Retiree Health Care Non-U.S. Defined Benefit 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 Service cost $ 15 $ 21 $ 18 $ 3 $ 3 $ 3 $ 25 $ 36 $ 34 Interest cost 29 30 31 11 10 13 33 37 38 Expected return on plan assets ( 27 ) ( 31 ) ( 36 ) ( 12 ) ( 9 ) ( 12 ) ( 66 ) ( 81 ) ( 78 ) Amortization of prior service cost (credit) — — — ( 2 ) ( 2 ) ( 2 ) 1 1 1 Recognized net actuarial loss 3 15 7 — — — 1 7 14 Net periodic benefit costs 20 35 20 — 2 2 ( 6 ) — 9 Settlement losses 64 13 16 — — — 10 2 1 Total, including other postretirement losses $ 84 $ 48 $ 36 $ — $ 2 $ 2 $ 4 $ 2 $ 10 All defined benefit and retiree health care benefit plan expense components other than service cost are recognized in OI&E in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Service cost is recognized within operating profit. For the U.S. qualified pension and retiree health care plans, the expected return on plan assets component of net periodic benefit cost is based upon a market-related value of assets. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the market-related value of assets is the fair value adjusted by a smoothing technique whereby certain gains and losses are phased in over a period of three years . 44 Changes in the benefit obligations and plan assets for defined benefit and retiree health care benefit plans are as follows: U.S. Defined Benefit U.S. Retiree Health Care Non-U.S. Defined Benefit 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 Change in plan benefit obligation Benefit obligation at beginning of year: $ 895 $ 1,097 $ 360 $ 389 $ 2,574 $ 2,868 Service cost 15 21 3 3 25 36 Interest cost 29 30 11 10 33 37 Participant contributions — — 15 14 5 9 Benefits paid ( 12 ) ( 12 ) ( 41 ) ( 38 ) ( 86 ) ( 101 ) Settlements ( 309 ) ( 162 ) — — ( 91 ) ( 12 ) Curtailments — — — — ( 4 ) — Actuarial loss (gain) ( 97 ) ( 79 ) ( 74 ) ( 18 ) ( 547 ) ( 111 ) Effects of exchange rate changes — — — — ( 242 ) ( 152 ) Benefit obligation at end of year $ 521 $ 895 $ 274 $ 360 $ 1,667 $ 2,574 Change in plan assets Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year: $ 934 $ 1,061 $ 385 $ 389 $ 2,813 $ 3,008 Actual return on plan assets ( 205 ) 37 ( 80 ) 19 ( 557 ) 75 Employer contributions (qualified plans) — — 1 1 9 7 Employer contributions (non-qualified plans) 13 10 — — — — Participant contributions — — 15 14 5 9 Benefits paid ( 12 ) ( 12 ) ( 41 ) ( 38 ) ( 86 ) ( 101 ) Settlements ( 309 ) ( 162 ) — — ( 91 ) ( 12 ) Effects of exchange rate changes — — — — ( 271 ) ( 173 ) Fair value of plan assets at end of year $ 421 $ 934 $ 280 $ 385 $ 1,822 $ 2,813 Funded status at end of year $ ( 100 ) $ 39 $ 6 $ 25 $ 155 $ 239 Changes in actuarial gains and losses in the projected benefit obligations are generally driven by discount rate movement. Amounts recognized on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, are as follows: U.S. Defined Benefit U.S. Retiree Health Care Non-U.S. Defined Benefit Total 2022 Overfunded retirement plans $ — $ 8 $ 180 $ 188 Accrued expenses and other liabilities & other long-term liabilities ( 3 ) — ( 6 ) ( 9 ) Underfunded retirement plans ( 97 ) ( 2 ) ( 19 ) ( 118 ) Funded status at end of 2022 $ ( 100 ) $ 6 $ 155 $ 61 2021 Overfunded retirement plans $ 73 $ 28 $ 291 $ 392 Accrued expenses and other liabilities & other long-term liabilities ( 5 ) — ( 5 ) ( 10 ) Underfunded retirement plans ( 29 ) ( 3 ) ( 47 ) ( 79 ) Funded status at end of 2021 $ 39 $ 25 $ 239 $ 303 Contributions to the plans meet or exceed all minimum funding requirements. We expect to contribute about $ 10 million to our retirement benefit plans in 2023. 45 Accumulated benefit obligations, which are generally less than the projected benefit obligations as they exclude the impact of future salary increases, were $ 489 million and $ 820 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, for the U.S. defined benefit plans, and $ 1.60 billion and $ 2.47 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, for the non-U.S. defined benefit plans.

The tables below set forth the fair value of our plan assets using the same three-level hierarchy of fair-value inputs described in Note 6. December 31, 2022 Level 1 Level 2 Other (a) Total Assets of U.S. defined benefit plan: Fixed income securities and cash equivalents $ — $ — $ 272 $ 272 Equity securities — — 149 149 Total $ — $ — $ 421 $ 421 Assets of U.S. retiree health care plan: Fixed income securities and cash equivalents $ 7 $ — $ 175 $ 182 Equity securities — — 98 98 Total $ 7 $ — $ 273 $ 280 Assets of non-U.S. defined benefit plans: Fixed income securities and cash equivalents $ 40 $ 60 $ 1,282 $ 1,382 Equity securities 52 1 387 440 Total $ 92 $ 61 $ 1,669 $ 1,822 (a) Consists of bond index and equity index funds, measured at net asset value per share, as well as cash equivalents. 46 December 31, 2021 Level 1 Level 2 Other (a) Total Assets of U.S. defined benefit plan: Fixed income securities and cash equivalents $ — $ — $ 655 $ 655 Equity securities — — 279 279 Total $ — $ — $ 934 $ 934 Assets of U.S. retiree health care plan: Fixed income securities and cash equivalents $ 10 $ — $ 238 $ 248 Equity securities — — 137 137 Total $ 10 $ — $ 375 $ 385 Assets of non-U.S. defined benefit plans: Fixed income securities and cash equivalents $ 71 $ 104 $ 2,045 $ 2,220 Equity securities 49 2 542 593 Total $ 120 $ 106 $ 2,587 $ 2,813 (a) Consists of bond index and equity index funds, measured at net asset value per share, as well as cash equivalents. The investments in our major benefit plans largely consist of low-cost, broad-market index funds to mitigate risks of concentration within market sectors. Our investment policy is designed to better match the interest rate sensitivity of the plan assets and liabilities. The appropriate mix of equity and bond investments is determined primarily through the use of detailed asset-liability modeling studies that look to balance the impact of changes in the discount rate against the need to provide asset growth to cover future service cost. Most of our plans around the world have a greater proportion of fixed income securities with return characteristics that are more closely aligned with changes in the liabilities caused by discount rate volatility. Assumptions and investment policies U.S. Defined Benefit U.S. Retiree Health Care Non-U.S. Defined Benefit 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 Weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations: Discount rate 5.67 % 2.74 % 5.68 % 3.05 % 3.45 % 1.57 % Long-term pay progression 3.75 % 3.70 % n/a n/a 3.03 % 3.15 % Weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost: Discount rate 3.82 % 2.95 % 3.05 % 2.74 % 1.57 % 1.31 % Long-term rate of return on plan assets 3.80 % 3.50 % 3.40 % 3.10 % 2.73 % 2.82 % Long-term pay progression 3.70 % 3.70 % n/a n/a 3.15 % 3.15 % We utilize a variety of methods to select an appropriate discount rate depending on the depth of the corporate bond market in the country in which the benefit plan operates. In the United States, we use a settlement approach whereby a portfolio of bonds is selected from the universe of actively traded high-quality U.S. corporate bonds. The selected portfolio is designed to simulate a portfolio that would provide cash flows sufficient to pay the plan’s expected benefit payments when due. The resulting discount rate reflects the rate of return of the selected portfolio of bonds. For our non-U.S. locations with a sufficient number of actively traded high-quality bonds, an analysis is performed in which the projected cash flows from the defined benefit plans are discounted against a yield curve constructed with an appropriate universe of high-quality corporate bonds available in each country. In this manner, a present value is developed. The discount rate selected is the single equivalent rate that produces the same present value. For countries that lack a sufficient corporate bond market, a government bond index is used to establish the discount rate. 47 Assumptions for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets are based on future expectations for returns for each asset class and the effect of periodic target asset allocation rebalancing. We adjust the results for the payment of reasonable expenses of the plan from plan assets. We believe our assumptions are appropriate based on the investment mix and long-term nature of the plans’ investments. Assumptions used for the non-U.S. defined benefit plans reflect the different economic environments within the various countries. The target allocation ranges for the plans that hold a substantial majority of the defined benefit assets are as follows: U.S. Defined Benefit U.S. Retiree Health Care Non-U.S. Defined Benefit Fixed income securities and cash equivalents 65 % – 80 % 65 % – 80 % 60 % – 100 % Equity securities 20 % – 35 % 20 % – 35 % 0 % – 40 % We rebalance the plans’ investments when they are outside the target allocation ranges. Weighted average asset allocations as of December 31 are as follows: U.S. Defined Benefit U.S. Retiree Health Care Non-U.S. Defined Benefit 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 Fixed income securities and cash equivalents 65 % 70 % 65 % 64 % 76 % 79 % Equity securities 35 % 30 % 35 % 36 % 24 % 21 % None of the plan assets related to the defined benefit pension plans and retiree health care benefit plan are directly invested in TI common stock. The following assumed future benefit payments to plan participants in the next 10 years are used to measure our benefit obligations. Almost all of the payments, which may vary significantly from these assumptions, will be made from plan assets and not from company assets. 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 – 2032 U.S. Defined Benefit $ 77 $ 75 $ 65 $ 63 $ 60 $ 227 U.S. Retiree Health Care 28 27 26 25 24 106 Non-U.S. Defined Benefit 84 87 89 91 92 487 Assumed health care cost trend rates for the U.S. retiree health care benefit plan as of December 31 are as follows: 2022 2021 Assumed health care cost trend rate for next year 7.00 % 6.50 % Ultimate trend rate 5.00 % 5.00 % Year in which ultimate trend rate is reached 2031 2028 Deferred compensation plans We have deferred compensation plans that allow U.S. employees whose base salary and management responsibility exceed a certain level to defer receipt of a portion of their cash compensation. Payments under these plans are made based on the participant’s distribution election and plan balance. Participants can earn a return on their deferred compensation based on notional investments in the same investment funds that are offered in our defined contribution plans. As of December 31, 2022, our liability to participants of the deferred compensation plans was $ 326 million and is recorded in other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. This amount reflects the accumulated participant deferrals and earnings thereon as of that date. We utilize total return swaps and investments in mutual funds that serve as economic hedges of our exposure to changes in the fair value of these liabilities. We record changes in the fair value of the liability and the related total return swaps and mutual funds in SG&A, as discussed in Note 6. As of December 31, 2022, we held $ 11 million in mutual funds related to these plans that are recorded in long-term investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 48 8. Debt and lines of credit Short-term borrowings We maintain a line of credit to provide additional liquidity through bank loans and, if necessary, to support commercial paper borrowings. As of December 31, 2022, the aforementioned line of credit was a variable-rate, revolving credit facility from a consortium of investment-grade banks that allows us to borrow up to $ 1 billion until March 2023. The interest rate on borrowings under this credit facility, if drawn, is indexed to the applicable Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (Term SOFR). As of December 31, 2022, our credit facility was undrawn, and we had no commercial paper outstanding. Long-term debt In April 2022, we retired $ 500 million of maturing debt. In August 2022, we issued two series of senior unsecured notes for an aggregate principal amount of $ 700 million, consisting of $ 400 million of 3.65 % notes due in 2032 and $ 300 million of 4.10 % notes due in 2052. We incurred $ 3 million of issuance and other related costs. The proceeds of the offering were $ 695 million, net of the original issuance discounts, which will be used for general corporate purposes.

The proceeds of the offering were $ 749 million, net of the original issuance discount, and were used for general corporate purposes. 49 Long-term debt outstanding is as follows: December 31, 2022 2021 Notes due 2022 at 1.85 % $ — $ 500 Notes due 2023 at 2.25 % 500 500 Notes due 2024 at 2.625 % 300 300 Notes due 2024 at 4.70 % 300 — Notes due 2025 at 1.375 % 750 750 Notes due 2026 at 1.125 % 500 500 Notes due 2027 at 2.90 % 500 500 Notes due 2028 at 4.60 % 500 — Notes due 2029 at 2.25 % 750 750 Notes due 2030 at 1.75 % 750 750 Notes due 2031 at 1.90 % 500 500 Notes due 2032 at 3.65 % 400 — Notes due 2039 at 3.875 % 750 750 Notes due 2048 at 4.15 % 1,500 1,500 Notes due 2051 at 2.70 % 500 500 Notes due 2052 at 4.10 % 300 — Total debt 8,800 7,800 Net unamortized discounts, premiums and issuance costs ( 65 ) ( 59 ) Total debt, including net unamortized discounts, premiums and issuance costs 8,735 7,741 Current portion of long-term debt ( 500 ) ( 500 ) Long-term debt $ 8,235 $ 7,241 Interest and debt expense was $ 214 million, $ 184 million and $ 190 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. This was net of the amortized discounts, premiums and issuance and other related costs. Cash payments for interest on long-term debt were $ 198 million, $ 181 million and $ 182 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Capitalized interest was not material. 9. Leases We conduct certain operations in leased facilities and also lease a portion of our data processing and other equipment. In addition, certain long-term supply agreements to purchase industrial gases are accounted for as operating leases. Lease agreements frequently include renewal provisions and require us to pay real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs. Our leases are included as a component of the following balance sheet lines: December 31, 2022 2021 Other long-term assets $ 431 $ 465 Accrued expenses and other liabilities $ 75 $ 82 Other long-term liabilities 344 383 50 Details of our operating leases are as follows: For Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Lease cost related to lease liabilities $ 67 $ 69 $ 70 Variable lease cost 46 56 36 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities: Operating cash flows for lease cost $ 61 $ 61 $ 59 Lease assets obtained in exchange for new lease liabilities $ 37 $ 210 $ 59 As of December 31, 2022, we had committed to make the following minimum payments under our non-cancellable operating leases: 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter Total Lease payments $ 81 $ 65 $ 54 $ 48 $ 41 $ 185 $ 474 Imputed lease interest ( 55 ) Total lease liabilities $ 419 The weighted-average remaining lease term was 8.8 years and 9.2 years as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The weighted-average discount rate was 2.71 % and 2.51 % as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 10. Commitments and contingencies Purchase commitments Our purchase commitments include payments for software licenses and contractual arrangements with suppliers when there is a fixed, non-cancellable payment schedule or when minimum payments are due with a reduced delivery schedule. As of December 31, 2022, we had committed to make the following minimum payments under our purchase commitments: 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter Total Purchase commitments $ 502 $ 529 $ 260 $ 236 $ 242 $ 337 $ 2,106 Indemnification guarantees We routinely sell products with an intellectual property indemnification included in the terms of sale. Historically, we have had only minimal, infrequent losses associated with these indemnities. Consequently, we cannot reasonably estimate any future liabilities that may result. Warranty costs/product liabilities Our stated warranties for semiconductor products obligate us to repair, replace or credit the purchase price of a covered product back to the buyer. Product claim consideration may exceed the price of our products. Historically, we have experienced a low rate of payments on product claims. Although we cannot predict the likelihood or amount of any future claims, we do not believe they will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. We accrue for known product-related claims if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. During the periods presented, there have been no material accruals or payments regarding product warranty or product liability. 51 General We are subject to various legal and administrative proceedings. Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of these matters, we believe that the results of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. 11. Supplemental financial information Restructuring charges/other Restructuring charges/other are included in Other for segment reporting purposes and are comprised of the following components: For Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Restructuring charges (a) $ — $ — $ 25 Integration charges (b) 257 104 — Gains on sales of assets (c) — ( 50 ) ( 1 ) Restructuring charges/other $ 257 $ 54 $ 24 (a) Includes severance and benefits, changes in estimates and other exit costs.

In 2022, we elected to perform a qualitative analysis to assess impairment of goodwill rather than to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The key qualitative factors considered in the assessment included changes in the industry and competitive environment, market capitalization and overall financial performance. Based on this qualitative analysis, we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. In 2022, 2021 and 2020, we determined no impairment was indicated.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 3, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical audit matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates. 55 Uncertain tax positions Description of the matter As discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company operates in the United States and multiple international tax jurisdictions, and its income tax returns are subject to examination by tax authorities in those jurisdictions who may challenge any tax position on these returns. Uncertainty in a tax position may arise because tax laws are subject to interpretation. The Company uses significant judgment to (1) determine whether, based on the technical merits, a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and (2) measure the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. Auditing management’s estimate of the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition involved auditor judgment because management’s estimate is complex, requires a high degree of judgment and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings. How we addressed the matter in our audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s accounting process for uncertain tax positions. For example, this included controls over the Company’s assessment of the technical merits of tax positions and management’s process to measure the benefit of those tax positions. Among other procedures performed, we involved our tax professionals to assess the technical merits of the Company’s tax positions. This included assessing the Company’s correspondence with the relevant tax authorities and evaluating income tax opinions or other third-party advice obtained by the Company. We also evaluated the appropriateness of the Company’s accounting for its tax positions taking into consideration relevant international and local income tax laws and legal rulings. We analyzed the Company’s assumptions and data used to determine the amount of tax benefit to recognize and tested the accuracy of the calculations. We also evaluated the adequacy of the Company’s financial statement disclosures in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements related to these tax matters. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1952.

Controls and procedures Disclosure controls and procedures An evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that those disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Internal control over financial reportin g Report by management on internal control over financial reporting The management of TI is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. TI’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements issued for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. TI management assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria) in Internal Control − Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on the COSO criteria. TI’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which immediately follows this report. 57 Report of independent registered public accounting firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Texas Instruments Incorporated Opinion on internal control over financial reporting We have audited Texas Instruments Incorporated’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Texas Instruments Incorporated (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes, and our report dated February 3, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying report by management on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Dallas, Texas February 3, 2023 58 ITEM 9B. Other information Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 disclosure During the first quarter of 2022 and as set forth in General License 1B from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control, we periodically filed notifications with the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) solely to permit the import, distribution and use of certain of our catalog semiconductor products in Russia.

PART I ITEM 1. Business We design and make semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. Our operations began in 1930, and we are incorporated in Delaware. With headquarters in Dallas, Texas, we have design, manufacturing or sales operations in more than 30 countries. Our two reportable segments are Analog and Embedded Processing, and we report the results of our remaining business activities in Other. In 2021, we generated $18.34 billion of revenue. For decades, we have operated with a passion to create a better world by making electronics more affordable through semiconductors. We were pioneers in the transition from vacuum tubes to transistors and then to integrated circuits. As each generation became more reliable, more affordable and lower in power, semiconductors were used by a growing number of customers and markets. This passion is alive today as we help our customers develop electronics and new applications, particularly in industrial and automotive markets. For many years, we have run our business with three overarching ambitions in mind. First, we will act like owners who will own the company for decades. Second, we will adapt and succeed in a world that is ever changing. And third, we will be a company that we are personally proud to be a part of and that we would want as our neighbor. Our ambitions are foundational to ensuring that we operate in a sustainable, socially thoughtful and environmentally responsible manner. When we are successful in achieving these ambitions, our employees, customers, communities and shareholders all win. As engineers, we are fortunate to work on exciting technology which helps our customers innovate to create a better world. Technology is the foundation of our company, but ultimately, our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate long-term value for owners is the growth of free cash flow per share. Our strategy to maximize free cash flow per share growth has three elements: The first element of our strategy is a business model that is focused on analog and embedded processing products and built around four competitive advantages. This business model is the result of a series of strategic decisions made over the years and that continue today. The four sustainable competitive advantages are a strong foundation of manufacturing and technology, a broad portfolio of analog and embedded processing products, the reach of our market channels, and diversity and longevity of our products, markets and customer positions. In combination, these four competitive advantages provide tangible benefits, are difficult to replicate and ultimately separate us from our best peers. Together, these competitive advantages help position TI in a unique class of companies capable of generating and returning significant amounts of cash for our owners. We make our investments with an eye towards long-term strengthening and leveraging of these advantages. The second element of our strategy to maximize free cash flow per share growth is disciplined allocation of capital. This spans how we select R&D projects, develop new capabilities like TI.com, invest in new manufacturing capacity or how we think about acquisitions and returning cash to our owners. Over a 10-year period from 2012 to 2021, we allocated $79 billion, which reinforces the importance of discipline in capital allocation. The largest allocation over this period was to drive organic growth, which includes investments in R&D, sales and marketing, capital expenditures and working capital for inventory. In this period we allocated just over $8 billion to capital expenditures, and in the years ahead this amount will increase, as we expect it to be the largest driver of long-term free cash flow growth. Beyond that, we also allocated capital to dividends and share repurchases. Dividends are designed to appeal to a broad set of investors, and share repurchases are made with the goal of the accretive capture of future free cash flow for long-term investors. Lastly, for inorganic growth, we allocate to acquisitions that meet our financial and strategic objectives. The third element of our strategy is efficiency, which we think of as constantly striving for more output for every dollar spent. This is about getting our investments in the most impactful areas to maximize the growth of long-term free cash flow per share; it is not just about optimizing cost-cutting to get to the last dollar of expense. We bring this philosophy of efficiency and continuous improvement to all areas of the company, and this focus on efficiency contributes to revenue growth, improved gross margins, disciplined R&D and SG&A expense, free cash flow margins and ultimately to free cash flow per share growth. 2 We believe that our business model with the combined effect of our four competitive advantages sets TI apart from our peers and will for a long time to come. We will invest to strengthen our competitive advantages, be disciplined in capital allocation and stay diligent in our pursuit of efficiencies. Finally, we will remain focused on the belief that long-term growth of free cash flow per share is the ultimate measure to generate value. Product information Semiconductors are electronic components that serve as the building blocks inside modern electronic systems and equipment. Semiconductors, generally known as “chips,” combine multiple transistors to form a complete electronic circuit. We have a diverse product portfolio that is used to accomplish many different things, such as converting and amplifying signals, interfacing with other devices, managing and distributing power, processing data, canceling noise and improving signal resolution. This broad portfolio includes approximately 80,000 products that are integral to almost every type of electronic equipment. Our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels. Our segments also reflect how management allocates resources and measures results. Analog Our Analog segment generated $14.05 billion of revenue in 2021. Analog semiconductors change real-world signals, such as sound, temperature, pressure or images, by conditioning them, amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors. Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in all electronic equipment by converting, distributing, storing, discharging, isolating and measuring electrical energy, whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or using a battery. As the digitization of electronics continues, there is a growing need and opportunity for analog chips to provide the power to run devices and the critical interfaces with human beings, the real world and other electronic devices. Our Analog products are used in many markets, particularly industrial, automotive and personal electronics. Sales of our Analog products generated about 77% of our revenue in 2021. Our Analog segment includes the following major product lines: Power and Signal Chain. Power Power includes products that help customers manage power in electronic systems. Our broad portfolio is designed to manage power requirements across different voltage levels, including battery-management solutions, DC/DC switching regulators, AC/DC and isolated controllers and converters, power switches, linear regulators, voltage references and lighting products. Signal Chain Signal Chain includes products that sense, condition and measure real-world signals to allow information to be transferred or converted for further processing and control. Our Signal Chain products include amplifiers, data converters, interface products, motor drives, clocks, logic and sensing products. Embedded Processing Our Embedded Processing segment generated $3.05 billion of revenue in 2021. Embedded Processing products are the digital “brains” of many types of electronic equipment. They are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for various combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application. Our devices vary from simple, low-cost microcontrollers used in applications such as electric toothbrushes to highly specialized, complex devices such as motor control. Our Embedded Processing products are used in many markets, particularly industrial and automotive. An important characteristic of our Embedded Processing products is that our customers often invest their own research and development (R&D) to write software that operates on our products. This investment tends to increase the length of our customer relationships because many customers prefer to reuse software from one product generation to the next. 3 Sales of Embedded Processing products generated about 17% of our revenue in 2021. Our Embedded Processing segment includes microcontrollers, digital signal processors (DSPs) and applications processors. Microcontrollers are self-contained systems with a processor core, memory and peripherals that are designed to control a set of specific tasks for electronic equipment. DSPs perform mathematical computations almost instantaneously to process or improve digital data. Applications processors are designed for specific computing activity. Other We report the results of our remaining business activities in Other, which includes operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for individually reportable segments and cannot be aggregated with other operating segments. Other generated $1.25 billion of revenue in 2021 and includes revenue from DLP ® products (primarily used to project high-definition images), calculators and certain custom semiconductors known as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). In Other, we also include items that are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments. Examples of these items include acquisition, integration and restructuring charges, as well as certain corporate-level items, such as litigation expenses, environmental costs and gains and losses from other activities, including asset dispositions. 4 Markets for our products The table below lists the major markets for our products in 2021 and the estimated percentage of our 2021 revenue that the market represented. The chart also lists, in declining order of our revenue, the sectors within each market. Market Sector Industrial Factory automation & control (41% of TI revenue) Building automation Grid infrastructure Medical Aerospace & defense Test & measurement Appliances Pro audio, video & signage Motor drives Power delivery Retail automation & payment Industrial transport Lighting Automotive Infotainment & cluster (21% of TI revenue) Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) Passive safety Hybrid, electric & powertrain systems Body electronics & lighting Personal electronics Mobile phones (24% of TI revenue) Portable electronics PC & notebooks Connected peripherals & printers Home theater & entertainment TV Tablets Wearables (non-medical) Data storage Gaming Communications equipment Wireless infrastructure (6% of TI revenue) Wired networking Broadband fixed line access Datacom module Enterprise systems Data center & enterprise computing (6% of TI revenue) Enterprise projectors Enterprise machine Other (calculators and other) (2% of TI revenue) Market characteristics Competitive landscape Despite recent consolidation, the analog and embedded processing markets remain highly fragmented. As a result, we face significant global competition from dozens of large and small companies, including both broad-based suppliers and niche suppliers. Our competitors also include emerging companies, particularly in Asia. 5 We believe that competitive performance in the semiconductor market generally depends on several factors, including the breadth of a company’s product line, the strength and reach of its channels to market, technological innovation, product development execution, technical support, customer service, quality, reliability, price and manufacturing capacity and capabilities. In addition, manufacturing process and package technologies that provide differentiated levels of performance and a structural cost advantage are competitive factors for our analog products, and customers’ prior investments in software development is a competitive factor for our embedded processing products. Market cycle The “semiconductor cycle” refers to the ebb and flow of supply and demand and the building and depleting of inventories. The semiconductor market historically has been characterized by periods of tight supply caused by strengthening demand and/or insufficient manufacturing capacity, followed by periods of surplus inventory caused by weakening demand and/or excess manufacturing capacity. These are typically referred to as upturns and downturns in the semiconductor cycle. Semiconductor cycles are affected by the significant time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing facilities. Seasonality Our revenue is subject to some seasonal variation. Historically, our sequential revenue growth rate tends to be weaker in the first and fourth quarters when compared with the second and third quarters. Customers, sales and distribution We sell our products to over 100,000 customers. Our customer base is diverse, with more than 40% of our revenue derived from customers outside our largest 100. We market and sell our products through direct sales channels, including our website and broad sales and applications team, and, to a lesser extent, through distributors. Over the past several years, we have been investing in new capabilities to build closer direct customer relationships. For example, in 2021 about two-thirds of our revenue was direct, and transactions on TI.com grew to about 10% of our revenue, as customers valued the convenience of purchasing online. Closer direct relationships with our customers help to strengthen our reach of market channel advantage and give us access to more customers and more of their design projects, leading to opportunities to sell more of our products into each design. Additionally, broader and deeper access gives us better insight and knowledge of customer needs. Our investments in new and improved capabilities to directly support our customers include website and e-commerce enhancements as well as inventory consignment programs and order fulfillment services. We expanded the reach of our TI.com e-commerce channel by offering a localized online experience in many countries, with convenience features such as immediate availability, local currency, payment methods, invoicing and importer of record. In addition to doing business directly with TI, we offer customers the option of using a single worldwide distributor and a few region-specific distributors for order fulfillment. Manufacturing Semiconductor manufacturing begins with a sequence of photolithographic and chemical processing steps that fabricate a number of semiconductor devices on a thin silicon wafer. Each device on the wafer is packaged and tested. The entire process takes place in highly specialized facilities that require substantial investments. We own and operate semiconductor manufacturing facilities in North America, Asia, Japan and Europe. These include both wafer fabrication and assembly/test facilities. We invest in manufacturing technologies and do most of our manufacturing in-house. This strategic decision to make manufacturing and technology a core competitive advantage provides us with tangible benefits of lower manufacturing costs and greater control of our supply chain. We have focused on creating a competitive manufacturing structural cost advantage by investing in our advanced 300-millimeter capacity. An unpackaged chip built on a 300-millimeter wafer costs about 40% less than an unpackaged chip built on a 200-millimeter wafer. 6 We continue to invest to strengthen our competitive advantage in manufacturing and technology as part of our long-term capacity planning. Progress and investments include: • continuing construction of RFAB2 (Richardson, Texas), our next 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facility, to begin production in the second half of 2022; • purchasing a 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facility in Lehi, Utah, to support analog and embedded processing manufacturing, which is expected to begin production in early 2023; and • planning construction on our next two 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facilities in Sherman, Texas, to begin in 2022. This North Texas site has the potential for up to four fabrication facilities to meet demand over time, as semiconductor growth in electronics, particularly in industrial and automotive markets, is expected to continue well into the future. Production is expected to begin in 2025. Together, these investments are designed to strengthen our manufacturing and technology competitive advantage, provide us with lower costs and greater control of our supply chain, and support growth over the next 10 to 15 years. We assess and are careful to address potential health, safety, and environmental risks presented by our operations, including our manufacturing operations. We care for our environment and work to prevent pollution and the potential risks related to climate change by implementing practices such as recycling and reusing materials, controlling harmful emissions, and properly handling hazardous and restricted substances. We expect to continue to maintain sufficient internal manufacturing capacity to meet the majority of our production needs and to obtain manufacturing equipment to support new technology developments and revenue growth. To supplement our manufacturing capacity and maximize our responsiveness to customer demand, we selectively use the capacity of outside suppliers, commonly known as foundries, and subcontractors. In 2021, we sourced about 20% of our total wafers from external foundries and about 40% of our assembly/test services from subcontractors. Inventory Our objectives for inventory are to maintain high levels of customer service, maintain stable and competitive lead times, minimize inventory obsolescence and improve manufacturing asset utilization. To meet these objectives and to allow greater flexibility in periods of high demand, our strategy is to build ahead of demand our broad-based products that are used across a diverse set of applications and customers and have low risk of obsolescence. Inventory levels will vary based on market conditions and seasonality. Raw materials We purchase materials, parts and supplies from a number of suppliers. In some cases we purchase such items from sole-source suppliers. The materials, parts and supplies essential to our business are generally available at present, and we believe that such materials, parts and supplies will be available in the foreseeable future. Intellectual property We own many patents and have many patent applications pending in the United States and other countries in fields relating to our business. We have developed a strong, broad-based patent portfolio and continually add patents to that portfolio. We also have license agreements, which vary in duration, involving rights to our portfolio or those of other companies. We do not consider our business materially dependent upon any one patent or patent license. 7 Information about our executive officers The following is an alphabetical list of the names and ages of the executive officers of the company and the positions or offices with the company held by each person named: Name Age Position Ahmad S.

Risk factors You should read the following risk factors in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and in materials incorporated by reference into these filings. These risk factors are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to TI, a company with broad international operations. Like many companies, we are susceptible to a potential downturn associated with macroeconomic weakness, which may affect our performance and the performance of our customers. Similarly, the price of our securities is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions, actual financial results that do not meet our and/or the investment community’s expectations, changes in our and/or the investment community’s expectations for our future results, dividends or share repurchases, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Risks related to our business and industry The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition is uncertain. The global spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) has created significant uncertainty and economic disruption, both near-term and potentially long-term. We have modified, and might further modify, our business practices in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, related third-party responses, including from government authorities and our suppliers, customers and distributors, and the economic and social ramifications of the disease and societal responses across the markets in which TI operates. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to affect our business, results of operation and financial condition is difficult to predict and depends on numerous evolving factors including: the duration and scope of the pandemic; government, social, business and other actions that have been and will be taken in response to the pandemic; and the effect of the pandemic on short- and long-term general economic conditions. We have experienced, and continue to experience, short- or long-term constrained supply or volatility in customer demand, which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results. Our global operations subject us to risks associated with domestic or international political, social, economic or other conditions. We have facilities in more than 30 countries. About 90% of our revenue comes from shipments to locations outside the United States; shipments of products to China-based customers represent about 25% of our revenue. Certain countries where we operate have experienced, and other countries may experience, trade tension that affects global trade and macroeconomic conditions through the enactment of tariffs, import or export restrictions, trade embargoes and sanctions, restrictions on cross-border investment and other trade barriers. Trade tensions impact our ability to deliver products and product support into China, cause Chinese customers to seek alternate suppliers and could otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial results. We are exposed to political, social and economic conditions, security risks, terrorism or other hostile acts, health conditions and epidemics, labor conditions, climate change risks and possible disruptions in transportation, communications and information technology networks of the various countries in which we operate. In addition, our global operations expose us to periods when the U.S. dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the non-U.S. currencies in which we transact business. The remeasurement of non-U.S. dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 9 We face substantial competition that requires us to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressures. We face intense technological and pricing competition in the markets in which we operate. We expect this competition will continue to increase from large competitors and from small competitors serving niche markets, and also from emerging companies, particularly in Asia, that sell products into the same markets in which we operate. For example, we may face increased competition as a result of China actively promoting and reshaping its domestic semiconductor industry through policy changes and investment. These actions, in conjunction with trade tensions, may restrict us from participating in the China market or may prevent us from competing effectively. Certain competitors possess sufficient financial, technical and management resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably against our products, and consolidation among our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively. The price and product development pressures that result from competition may lead to reduced profit margins and lost business opportunities in the event that we are unable to match the price declines or cost efficiencies, or meet the technological, product, support, software or manufacturing advancements of our competitors. Changes in expected demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our customers include companies in a wide range of end markets and sectors within those markets. If demand in one or more sectors within our end markets declines or the rate of growth slows, our results of operations may be adversely affected. The cyclical nature of the semiconductor market occasionally leads to significant and rapid increases and decreases in product demand. Additionally, the loss or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of our large customers, including curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers, the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustments, changes in demand for customer products, or trade restrictions, may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our results of operations also might suffer because of a general decline in customer demand resulting from, for example: uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets; natural events, epidemics or domestic or international political, social, economic or other conditions; breaches of customer information technology systems that disrupt customer operations; or a customer’s inability to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity. Our ability to match inventory and production with the product mix needed to fill orders may affect our ability to meet a quarter’s revenue forecast. Due to strong demand, our manufacturing lead times for some products are longer than normal, and lead times might continue to extend. We manufacture products with the intent to provide high levels of customer service. Our manufacturing forecasts are based on multiple assumptions, and if inaccurate, could cause us to hold inadequate, excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our operating results and our reputation could be adversely affected by cybersecurity events, breaches, disruptions or other incidents relating to our information technology systems. Breaches, disruptions or other incidents relating to our information technology systems or the systems of our customers, vendors and other third parties could be caused by factors such as computer viruses, system failures, restricted network access, unauthorized access, terrorism, employee malfeasance, or human error. These events could, among other things, compromise our information technology networks; result in corrupt or lost data or the unauthorized release of our, our customers’ or our suppliers’ confidential or proprietary information; cause a disruption to our manufacturing and other operations; result in the release of personal data; or cause us to incur costs associated with increased protection, remediation, regulatory inquiries or penalties, or claims for damages, any of which could adversely affect our operating results and our reputation. Cybersecurity or other threats to our information technology systems or the systems of our customers, vendors and other third parties are frequent and constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of defending against them. 10 Our ability to successfully implement strategic, business and organizational changes could affect our business plans and results of operations. From time to time, we undertake strategic, business and organizational changes, including acquisitions, divestitures and restructuring actions, to support or carry out our objectives. For example, the purchase of our 300-millimeter semiconductor factory in Lehi, Utah in 2021. If we do not successfully implement these changes, our business plans and operating results could be adversely affected. We may not achieve or sustain the expected growth, cost savings or other benefits of strategic, business and organizational changes, and charges associated with these actions could differ materially in amount and timing from our expectations. Our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we operate. We have manufacturing, data and design facilities and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather, geological events or epidemics that could disrupt operations. Climate change might exacerbate these occurrences or cause natural disasters to occur with greater frequency. A natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption, particularly where we have principal manufacturing and design operations, as listed in the Properties section in Item 2, may adversely affect our results and financial condition. Rapid technological change in markets we serve requires us to develop new technologies and products. Rapid technological change in markets we serve could contribute to shortened product life cycles and a decline in average selling prices of our products. Our results of operations depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop, manufacture and market innovative products in a timely and cost-effective manner. We make significant investments in research and development to improve existing technology and products, develop new products to meet changing customer demands, and improve our production processes. In some cases, we might not realize a return or the expected return on our investments because they are generally made before commercial viability can be assured. Further, projects that are commercially viable may not contribute to our operating results until at least a few years after they are completed. We face supply chain and manufacturing risks. We rely on third parties to supply us with goods and services in a cost-effective and timely manner. Our access to needed goods and services may be adversely affected by potential disputes with suppliers or disruptions in our own or suppliers’ operations as a result of, for example: quality excursions; uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets; domestic or international political, social, economic and other conditions; natural events or epidemics in the locations in which our suppliers operate; or limited or delayed access to and high costs of key materials, natural resources, services and utilities. Additionally, a breach or other incident relating to our suppliers’ information technology systems could result in a release of confidential or proprietary information. If our suppliers are unable to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity, we may be unable to obtain needed supplies, collect accounts receivable or access needed technology. In particular, our manufacturing processes and critical manufacturing equipment, and those of our suppliers, require that certain key materials, natural resources, services and utilities be available. Suppliers of these items have and might continue to extend lead times, limit supply or increase prices due to factors beyond our control. Limited or delayed access to and high costs of key materials, natural resources, services and utilities could adversely affect our results of operations. Our products contain materials that are subject to conflict minerals reporting requirements. Our relationships with customers and suppliers may be adversely affected if we are unable to describe our products as conflict-free. Additionally, our costs may increase if one or more of our customers demand that we change the sourcing of materials we cannot identify as conflict-free. Our inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect our results of operations. We have made and will continue to make significant investments in manufacturing capacity, and we might not realize our expected return on those investments. We subcontract a portion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our products, and we depend on third parties to provide advanced logic manufacturing process technology development. We do not have long-term contracts with all of these suppliers, and the number of alternate suppliers is limited. Reliance on these suppliers involves risks, including possible shortages of capacity in periods of high demand, suppliers’ inability to develop and deliver advanced logic manufacturing process technology in a timely, cost-effective, and appropriate manner, the possibility of suppliers’ imposition of increased costs on us and the unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property. 11 Our results of operations and our reputation could be affected by warranty claims, product liability claims, product recalls or legal proceedings. Claims based on warranty, product liability, epidemic or delivery failures, or other grounds relating to our products, software, manufacturing, services, designs, communications or cybersecurity could lead to significant expenses as we defend the claims or pay damage awards or settlements. In the event of a claim, we would also incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected customer or end consumer. Any such claims may also cause us to write off the value of related inventory. We maintain product liability insurance, but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims. In addition, it is possible for a customer to recall a product containing a TI part, for example, with respect to products used in automotive applications or handheld electronics, which may cause us to incur costs and expenses relating to the recall. Any of these events could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and reputation. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by distributors’ promotion of competing product lines or our distributors’ financial performance. In 2021, about one-third of our revenue was generated from sales of our products through distributors. Our distributors carry competing product lines, and our sales could be affected if semiconductor distributors promote competing products over our products. Moreover, our results of operations could be affected if our distributors suffer financial difficulties that result in their inability to pay amounts owed to us. Disputes with current or former distributors could be disruptive or harmful to our business. Our margins vary. Our profit margins vary due to a number of factors, which may include customer demand and shipment volume; our manufacturing processes; product mix; inventory levels; tariffs; freight costs; and new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting practices or standards. In addition, we operate in a highly competitive market environment that might adversely affect pricing for our products. Because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating costs is fixed. In general, these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or factory loadings, and can adversely affect profit margins as a result. Our continued success depends in part on our ability to retain and recruit a sufficient number of qualified employees in a competitive environment. Our continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel, as well as the effective management of succession for key employees. Skilled and experienced personnel in our industry, including engineering, management, marketing, technical and staff personnel, are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key engineering, management and technical personnel that we require to execute our business strategy. Our ability to recruit internationally or deploy employees to various locations may be limited by immigration laws and policies, including changes to, or the administration or interpretation of, those laws and policies. Legal and regulatory risks Our operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject. We are subject to complex laws, rules and regulations affecting our domestic and international operations relating to, for example, the environment and climate change; safety; health; trade; bribery and corruption; financial reporting; tax; data privacy and protection; labor and employment; competition; market access; epidemics; intellectual property ownership and infringement; and the movement of currency. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive and could restrict our ability to manufacture or ship our products and operate our business. If we do not comply or if we become subject to enforcement activity, we could be subject to fines, penalties or other legal liability. Furthermore, should these laws, rules and regulations be amended or expanded, or new ones enacted, we could incur materially greater compliance costs or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business. 12 Increased focus from government authorities, investors, customers and other key stakeholders on environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters has led to new and more stringent reporting standards and disclosure requirements. As the nature, scope and complexity of ESG reporting, diligence and disclosure requirements expand, we might have to undertake costly efforts to control, assess and report on ESG metrics. Some of these complex laws, rules and regulations – for example, those related to environmental, safety and health requirements – may particularly affect us in the jurisdictions in which we manufacture products, especially if such laws and regulations: require the use of abatement equipment beyond what we currently employ; require the addition or elimination of a material or process to or from our current manufacturing processes; or impose costs, fees or reporting requirements on the direct or indirect use of energy, natural resources, or materials or gases used or emitted into the environment in connection with the manufacture of our products. A substitute for a prohibited material or process might not be available, or might not be available at reasonable cost. Our results of operations could be affected by changes in tax-related matters. We have facilities in more than 30 countries and as a result are subject to taxation and audit by a number of taxing authorities. Tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate. If our tax rate increases, our results of operations could be adversely affected. A number of factors could cause our tax rate to increase, including a change in the jurisdictions in which our profits are earned and taxed; a change in the mix of profits from those jurisdictions; changes in available tax credits or deductions, including for amounts relating to stock compensation; changes in applicable tax rates; changes in tariff regulations or surcharges; changes in accounting principles; or adverse resolution of audits by taxing authorities. We have deferred tax assets on our balance sheet. Changes in applicable tax laws and regulations or in our business performance could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax assets, which could also affect our results of operations. In addition, we are subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction. These laws and regulations can be complex and subject to interpretation. Changes in these laws and regulations, including those that align with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting recommendations, could affect the locations where we are deemed to earn income, which could in turn affect our results of operations. Each quarter we forecast our tax expense based on our forecast of our performance for the year. If that performance forecast changes, our forecasted tax expense will change. Our performance depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights and to maintain freedom of operation. Access to worldwide markets depends in part on the continued strength of our intellectual property portfolio in all jurisdictions where we conduct business. There can be no assurance that, as our business evolves, we will obtain the necessary intellectual property rights, or that we will be able to independently develop the technology, software or know-how necessary to conduct our business or that we can do so without infringing the intellectual property rights of others. To the extent that we have to rely on technology from others for which a license is required, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such a license at all or on terms we consider reasonable. We, directly and indirectly, face infringement claims from third parties, including non-practicing entities that have acquired patents to pursue enforcement actions against other companies. We also face infringement claims where we or our customers make, use or sell products and where the intellectual property laws may be less established or less predictable. These assertions, whether or not of any merit, expose us to claims for damages and/or injunctions from third parties, as well as claims for indemnification by our customers in instances where we have a contractual or other legal obligation to indemnify them against damages resulting from infringement claims. We actively enforce and protect our own intellectual property rights. However, our efforts cannot prevent all misappropriation or improper use of our protected technology and information, including, for example, third parties’ use of our patented or copyrighted technology, or our trade secrets in their products without the right to do so, or third parties’ sale of counterfeit products bearing our trademark. The risk of unfair copying or cloning may impede our ability to sell our products. The laws of countries where we operate may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as U.S. laws. 13 Risks related to our financing activities and other risks Our debt could affect our operations and financial condition. From time to time, we issue debt securities with various interest rates and maturities. While we believe we will have the ability to service this debt, our ability to make principal and interest payments when due depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles, and business and other factors affecting our operations, including our other risk factors, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, our obligation to make principal and interest payments could divert funds that otherwise might be invested in our operations or returned to shareholders, or could cause us to raise funds by, for example, issuing new debt or equity or selling assets. Our results of operations and liquidity could be affected by changes in the financial markets. We maintain bank accounts, a portfolio of investments, access to one or more multiyear revolving credit agreements and the ability to issue debt to support the financing needs of the company. Our ability to fund our operations, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, service our debt obligations and meet our cash return objectives depends upon continuous access to our bank and investment accounts, and may depend on access to our bank credit lines that support commercial paper borrowings and provide additional liquidity through short-term bank loans. If we are unable to access these accounts and credit lines (for example, due to instability in the financial markets), our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected and our ability to access the capital markets or redeem our investments could be restricted. Material impairments of our goodwill could adversely affect our results of operations. We have a significant amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet. Charges associated with impairments of goodwill could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. ITEM 1B. Unresolved staff comments Not applicable. 14 ITEM 2.

[Reserved] No longer required per the amendments to Regulation S-K that eliminate Item 301. 16 ITEM 7. Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Overview We design, make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. Technology is the foundation of our company, but ultimately, our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate long-term value for owners is the growth of free cash flow per share. Our strategy to maximize free cash flow per share growth has three elements: 1. A great business model that is focused on analog and embedded processing products and built around four sustainable competitive advantages. The four sustainable competitive advantages are powerful in combination and provide tangible benefits: i. A strong foundation of manufacturing and technology that provides lower costs and greater control of our supply chain. ii. A broad portfolio of analog and embedded processing products that offers more opportunity per customer and more value for our investments. iii. The reach of our market channels that gives access to more customers and more of their design projects, leading to the opportunity to sell more of our products into each design and gives us better insight and knowledge of customer needs. iv. Diversity and longevity of our products, markets and customer positions that provide less single point dependency and longer returns on our investments. Together, these competitive advantages help position TI in a unique class of companies capable of generating and returning significant amounts of cash for our owners. We make our investments with an eye towards long-term strengthening and leveraging of these advantages. 2. Discipline in allocating capital to the best opportunities. This spans how we select R&D projects, develop new capabilities like TI.com, invest in new manufacturing capacity or how we think about acquisitions and returning cash to our owners. 3. Efficiency, which means constantly striving for more output for every dollar spent. We believe that our business model with the combined effect of our four competitive advantages sets TI apart from our peers and will for a long time to come. We will invest to strengthen our competitive advantages, be disciplined in capital allocation and stay diligent in our pursuit of efficiencies. Finally, we will remain focused on the belief that long-term growth of free cash flow per share is the ultimate measure to generate value. Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document. In the following discussion of our results of operations: • Our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels, and how management allocates resources and measures results. See Note 1 to the financial statements for more information regarding our segments. • When we discuss our results: ◦ Unless otherwise noted, changes in our revenue are attributable to changes in customer demand, which are evidenced by fluctuations in shipment volumes. ◦ New products do not tend to have a significant impact on our revenue in any given period because we sell such a large number of products. ◦ From time to time, our revenue and gross profit are affected by changes in demand for higher-priced or lower-priced products, which we refer to as changes in the “mix” of products shipped. 17 ◦ Because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed. When factory loadings decrease, our fixed costs are spread over reduced output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins decrease. Conversely, as factory loadings increase, our fixed costs are spread over increased output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins increase. • For an explanation of free cash flow and the term “annual operating tax rate,” see the Non-GAAP financial information section. • All dollar amounts in the tables are stated in millions of U.S. dollars. Our results of operations provides details of our financial results for 2021 and 2020 and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020. Discussion of 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and its effects are impacting and will likely continue to impact market conditions and business operations across industries worldwide, including at TI. Therefore, we remain cautious about how the economy might behave for the next few years and continue to monitor potential impact on our operations. Results of operations Our strategic focus is on analog and embedded processing products sold into six end markets: industrial, automotive, personal electronics, communications equipment, enterprise systems and other. While all end markets represent good opportunities, we place additional strategic emphasis on designing and selling those products into the industrial and automotive markets, which we believe represent the best growth opportunities. Gross margin of 67.5% reflected the quality of our product portfolio, as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, including the benefit of 300-millimeter production. Our focus on analog and embedded processing allows us to generate strong cash flow from operations. Our cash flow from operations of $8.76 billion underscored the strength of our business model. Free cash flow was $6.29 billion and represented 34.3% of revenue. During 2021, we returned $4.41 billion to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. Over the same period, our dividend represented 62% of free cash flow, underscoring its sustainability. Details of financial results – 2021 compared with 2020 Revenue of $18.34 billion increased $3.88 billion, or 27%, due to higher revenue from Analog and, to a lesser extent, Embedded Processing. Gross profit of $12.38 billion was up $3.11 billion, or 34%, primarily due to higher revenue. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit increased to 67.5% from 64.1%. Operating expenses (R&D and SG&A) were $3.22 billion compared with $3.15 billion. Acquisition charges were $142 million compared with $198 million and were non-cash. Restructuring charges/other was $54 million due to integration charges at our Lehi, Utah, manufacturing facility partially offset by gains on sales of assets, compared with $24 million due to an Embedded Processing action in 2020. Operating profit was $8.96 billion, or 48.8% of revenue, compared with $5.89 billion, or 40.8% of revenue. Other income and expense (OI&E) was $143 million of income compared with $313 million of income, which decreased primarily due to lower royalty income. See Note 11 to the financial statements. Our provision for income taxes was $1.15 billion compared with $422 million. This increase was due to higher income before income taxes and lower discrete tax benefits compared to 2020, which included a $249 million benefit from the settlement of a depreciation-related uncertain tax position. 18 Our annual operating tax rate, which does not include discrete tax items, was 14% in both periods. We use “annual operating tax rate” to describe the estimated annual effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate, which includes discrete tax items, was 13% in 2021 compared with 7% in 2020. See Note 4 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to our effective tax rate. Net income was $7.77 billion compared with $5.60 billion. EPS was $8.26 compared with $5.97. Segment results – 2021 compared with 2020 Analog (includes Power and Signal Chain product lines) 2021 2020 Change Revenue $ 14,050 $ 10,886 29 % Operating profit 7,393 4,912 51 % Operating profit % of revenue 52.6 % 45.1 % Analog revenue increased in both product lines, led by Signal Chain. Operating profit increased primarily due to higher revenue and associated gross profit. Embedded Processing (includes microcontrollers and processors) 2021 2020 Change Revenue $ 3,049 $ 2,570 19 % Operating profit 1,174 743 58 % Operating profit % of revenue 38.5 % 28.9 % Embedded Processing revenue increased. Operating profit increased primarily due to higher revenue and associated gross profit. Other (includes DLP ® products, calculators and custom ASIC products) 2021 2020 Change Revenue $ 1,245 $ 1,005 24 % Operating profit * 393 239 64 % Operating profit % of revenue 31.6 % 23.8 % * Includes acquisition charges and restructuring charges/other Other revenue increased $240 million, and operating profit increased $154 million. Financial condition At the end of 2021, total cash (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments) was $9.74 billion, an increase of $3.17 billion from the end of 2020. Accounts receivable were $1.70 billion, an increase of $287 million compared with the end of 2020. Days sales outstanding at the end of 2021 were 32 compared with 31 at the end of 2020. Inventory was $1.91 billion, a decrease of $45 million from the end of 2020. Days of inventory at the end of 2021 were 116 compared with 123 at the end of 2020. Liquidity and capital resources Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations. Additional sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and access to debt markets. We also have a variable rate, revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2021, our credit facility was undrawn, and we had no commercial paper outstanding. Cash flows from operating activities for 2021 were $8.76 billion, an increase of $2.62 billion due to higher net income and lower cash used for working capital. 19 Investing activities for 2021 used $4.10 billion compared with $922 million in 2020. Capital expenditures were $2.46 billion compared with $649 million in 2020 and were primarily for semiconductor manufacturing equipment and facilities in both periods, including the purchase of our 300-millimeter semiconductor factory in Lehi, Utah, during 2021. As we continue to invest to strengthen our competitive advantage in manufacturing and technology as part of our long-term capacity planning, we expect our capital expenditures to be higher than historical levels. Short-term investments used cash of $1.65 billion in 2021 compared with $241 million in 2020. Financing activities for 2021 used $3.14 billion compared with $4.55 billion in 2020. In 2021, we received net proceeds of $1.50 billion from the issuance of fixed-rate, long-term debt and retired maturing debt of $550 million. In 2020, we received net proceeds of $1.50 billion from the issuance of fixed-rate, long-term debt and retired maturing debt of $500 million. Dividends paid in 2021 were $3.89 billion compared with $3.43 billion in 2020, reflecting an increased dividend rate. We used $527 million to repurchase 2.9 million shares of our common stock compared with $2.55 billion used in 2020 to repurchase 23.4 million shares. Employee exercises of stock options provided cash proceeds of $377 million compared with $470 million in 2020. We had $4.63 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $5.11 billion of short-term investments as of December 31, 2021. We believe we have the necessary financial resources and operating plans to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend and debt-related payments and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months. Non-GAAP financial information This MD&A includes references to free cash flow and ratios based on that measure. These are financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). Free cash flow was calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from the most directly comparable GAAP measure, cash flows from operating activities (also referred to as cash flow from operations). We believe that free cash flow and the associated ratios provide insight into our liquidity, our cash-generating capability and the amount of cash potentially available to return to shareholders, as well as insight into our financial performance. These non-GAAP measures are supplemental to the comparable GAAP measures. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in the table below. For Years Ended December 31, 2021 2020 Cash flow from operations (GAAP) $ 8,756 $ 6,139 Capital expenditures (2,462) (649) Free cash flow (non-GAAP) $ 6,294 $ 5,490 Revenue $ 18,344 $ 14,461 Cash flow from operations as a percentage of revenue (GAAP) 47.7 % 42.5 % Free cash flow as a percentage of revenue (non-GAAP) 34.3 % 38.0 % This MD&A also includes references to an annual operating tax rate, a non-GAAP term we use to describe the estimated annual effective tax rate, a GAAP measure that by definition does not include discrete tax items. We believe the term annual operating tax rate helps differentiate from the effective tax rate, which includes discrete tax items. Critical accounting estimates Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements. As disclosed in Note 2, the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. However, based on facts and circumstances inherent in developing estimates and assumptions, management believes it is unlikely that applying other estimates and assumptions would have a material impact on the financial statements. We consider the following accounting policies to be those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and that require a higher degree of judgment. 20 Income taxes In determining net income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax provisions and the resultant tax liabilities and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In the ordinary course of global business, there may be many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. The calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the interpretation and application of complex tax laws, and significant judgment is necessary to (i) determine whether, based on the technical merits, a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and (ii) measure the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. Although we believe the estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different from what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals. As part of our financial process, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered. If recovery is not likely, the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are estimated not to be ultimately recoverable. Our judgment regarding future recoverability of our deferred tax assets may change due to various factors, including changes in U.S. or international tax laws and changes in market conditions and their impact on our assessment of taxable income in future periods. These changes, if any, may require adjustments to the valuation allowances and an accompanying reduction or increase in net income in the period when such determinations are made. Inventory valuation allowances Inventory is valued net of allowances for unsalable or obsolete raw materials, work in process and finished goods. Statistical allowances are determined quarterly for raw materials and work in process based on historical disposals of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons. For finished goods, quarterly statistical allowances are determined by comparing inventory levels of individual parts to historical shipments, current backlog and estimated future sales in order to identify inventory considered unlikely to be sold. A specific allowance for each material type will be carried if there is a significant event not captured by the statistical allowance, such as an end-of-life part or demand with imminent risk of cancellation. Allowances are also calculated quarterly for instances where inventoried costs for individual products are in excess of the net realizable value for those products. Actual future write-offs of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons may differ from estimates and calculations used to determine valuation allowances due to changes in customer demand, customer negotiations, technology shifts and other factors. Commitments and contingencies See Note 10 to the financial statements for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies. 21 ITEM 7A. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk Foreign exchange risk The U.S. dollar is our functional currency for financial reporting. Our non-U.S. entities own assets or liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars or other currencies, and exchange rate fluctuations in those jurisdictions may impact our effective tax rate. Our balance sheet also reflects amounts remeasured from non-U.S. dollar currencies. Because most of the aggregate non-U.S. dollar balance sheet exposure is hedged by forward currency exchange contracts, which are based on year-end 2021 balances and currency exchange rates, a hypothetical 10% plus or minus fluctuation in non-U.S. currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar would result in a pretax currency exchange gain or loss of approximately $1 million. We use these forward currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings impact that exchange rate fluctuations may have on our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures. As of December 31, 2021, we had forward currency exchange contracts outstanding with a notional value of $313 million to hedge net balance sheet exposures (including $127 million to sell Japanese yen, $82 million to sell British pounds and $42 million to sell euros). Similar hedging activities existed at year-end 2020. Interest rate risk We have the following potential exposure to changes in interest rates: (i) the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and short-term investments, which could produce a gain or a loss; and (ii) the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our debt. As of December 31, 2021, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and short-term investments by about $15 million and decrease the fair value of our long-term debt by $715 million. Because interest rates on our long-term debt are fixed, changes in interest rates would not affect the cash flows associated with long-term debt. Equity risk Long-term investments at year-end 2021 include the following: • Investments in mutual funds – includes mutual funds that were selected to generate returns that offset changes in certain liabilities related to deferred compensation arrangements. The mutual funds hold a variety of debt and equity investments. • Investments in venture capital funds – includes investments in limited partnerships (accounted for under either the equity method or at cost with adjustments to observable market changes or impairments). • Equity investments – includes non-marketable (non-publicly traded) equity securities. Investments in mutual funds are stated at fair value. Changes in prices of the mutual fund investments are expected to offset related changes in certain deferred compensation liabilities. Non-marketable equity securities and certain venture capital funds are stated at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes. Investments in the remaining venture capital funds are stated using the equity method. See Note 6 to the financial statements for details of equity and other long-term investments. We also utilize total return swaps to economically hedge exposure to changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements with employees. Gains or losses from changes in the fair value of these total return swaps generally offset the related losses or gains on the deferred compensation liabilities. 22 ITEM 8.

Description of business, including segment and geographic area information We design, make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. We have two reportable segments, Analog and Embedded Processing, each of which represents groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels. • Analog semiconductors change real-world signals, such as sound, temperature, pressure or images, by conditioning them, amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors. Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in all electronic equipment by converting, distributing, storing, discharging, isolating and measuring electrical energy, whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or using a battery. Our Analog segment consists of two major product lines: Power and Signal Chain. • Embedded Processing products are the digital “brains” of many types of electronic equipment. They are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for various combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application. We report the results of our remaining business activities in Other. Other includes operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for individually reportable segments and cannot be aggregated with other operating segments. Other includes DLP ® products, calculators and custom ASIC products. In Other, we also include items that are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments. Examples of these items include acquisition, integration and restructuring charges (see Note 11); and certain corporate-level items, such as litigation expenses, environmental costs, insurance settlements, and gains and losses from other activities, including asset dispositions. We allocate the remainder of our expenses associated with corporate activities to our operating segments based on specific methodologies, such as percentage of operating expenses or headcount. Our centralized manufacturing and support organizations, such as facilities, procurement and logistics, provide support to our operating segments, including those in Other. Costs incurred by these organizations, including depreciation, are charged to the segments on a per-unit basis. Consequently, depreciation expense is not an independently identifiable component within the segments’ results and, therefore, is not provided. With the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segment, nor does the chief operating decision maker evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information. We have no material intersegment revenue. The accounting policies of the segments are consistent with those described in the summary of significant accounting policies and practices. 29 Segment information For Years Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Revenue: Analog $ 14,050 $ 10,886 $ 10,223 Embedded Processing 3,049 2,570 2,943 Other 1,245 1,005 1,217 Total revenue $ 18,344 $ 14,461 $ 14,383 Operating profit: Analog $ 7,393 $ 4,912 $ 4,477 Embedded Processing 1,174 743 907 Other 393 239 339 Total operating profit $ 8,960 $ 5,894 $ 5,723 Geographic area information The following geographic area information includes revenue, based on product shipment destination, and property, plant and equipment, based on physical location. The geographic revenue information does not necessarily reflect end demand by geography because our products tend to be shipped to the locations where our customers manufacture their products. For Years Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Revenue: United States $ 1,906 $ 1,547 $ 1,827 Asia (a) 12,185 9,541 8,650 Europe, Middle East and Africa 2,802 2,249 2,707 Japan 959 734 796 Rest of world 492 390 403 Total revenue $ 18,344 $ 14,461 $ 14,383 (a) Revenue from products shipped into China was $ 10.0 billion, $ 8.0 billion and $ 7.2 billion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which includes shipments to customers that manufacture in China and then export end products to their customers around the world, as well as distributors that transship inventory through China to service other countries. December 31, 2021 2020 Property, plant and equipment: United States $ 3,648 $ 2,036 Asia (a) 1,292 1,005 Europe, Middle East and Africa 47 52 Japan 139 165 Rest of world 15 11 Total property, plant and equipment $ 5,141 $ 3,269 (a) Property, plant and equipment at our two sites in the Philippines was $ 370 million and $ 333 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Property, plant and equipment at our sites in China was $ 570 million and $ 370 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 30 Major customer One of our end customers accounted for 9 %, 10 % and 8 % of revenue in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, recognized primarily in our Analog segment. No end customer accounted for 10% or more of revenue in 2021 or 2019. 2. Basis of presentation and significant accounting policies and practices Basis of presentation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The basis of these financial statements is comparable for all periods presented herein. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. All dollar and share amounts in the financial statements and tables in these notes, except per-share amounts, are presented in millions unless otherwise indicated. We have reclassified certain amounts in the prior periods’ financial statements to conform to the 2021 presentation. The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates from which final results may vary. Significant accounting policies and practices Revenue recognition We generate revenue primarily from the sale of semiconductor products, either directly to a customer or to a distributor, and recognize revenue when control is transferred. Control is considered transferred when title and risk of loss pass, when the customer becomes obligated to pay and, where required, when the customer has accepted the products. This transfer generally occurs at a point in time upon shipment or delivery to the customer or distributor, depending upon the terms of the sales order. Payment for sales to customers and distributors is generally due on our standard commercial terms. For sales to distributors, payment is not contingent upon resale of the products. Revenue from sales of our products that are subject to inventory consignment agreements is recognized at a point in time, when the customer or distributor pulls product from consignment inventory that we store at designated locations. Delivery and transfer of control occur at that point, when title and risk of loss transfers and the customer or distributor becomes obligated to pay for the products pulled from inventory. Until the products are pulled for use or sale by the customer or distributor, we retain control over the products’ disposition, including the right to pull back or relocate the products. The revenue recognized is adjusted based on allowances, which are prepared on a portfolio basis using a most likely amount methodology based on analysis of historical data and contractual terms. These allowances, which are not material, generally include adjustments for pricing arrangements, product returns , incentives and credit losses. We recognize shipping fees, if any, received from customers in revenue. We include the related shipping and handling costs in cost of revenue. The majority of our customers pay these fees directly to third parties. Advertising costs We expense advertising and other promotional costs as incurred. This expense was $ 27 million, $ 28 million and $ 30 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Income taxes We account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach. We record the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences related to events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns. We record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Other assessed taxes Some transactions require us to collect taxes such as sales, value-added and excise taxes from our customers. These transactions are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Income on a net (excluded from revenue) basis. 31 Leases We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Leases are included in other long-term assets, accrued expenses and other liabilities, and other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Lease assets represent our right to use underlying assets for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligations to make lease payments over the lease term. On the commencement date, leases are evaluated for classification, and assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. We use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement in determining the present value of lease payments. Operating lease expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Our lease values include options to extend or not to terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options. We have agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for as a single lease component. Leases with an initial lease term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; we recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Earnings per share (EPS) We use the two-class method for calculating EPS because the restricted stock units (RSUs) we grant are participating securities containing non-forfeitable rights to receive dividend equivalents. Under the two-class method, a portion of net income is allocated to RSUs and excluded from the calculation of income allocated to common stock. Computation and reconciliation of earnings per common share are as follows: For Years Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Net Income Shares EPS Net Income Shares EPS Net Income Shares EPS Basic EPS: Net income $ 7,769 $ 5,595 $ 5,017 Income allocated to RSUs ( 33 ) ( 27 ) ( 32 ) Income allocated to common stock $ 7,736 923 $ 8.38 $ 5,568 921 $ 6.05 $ 4,985 936 $ 5.33 Dilutive effect of stock compensation plans 13 12 16 Diluted EPS: Net income $ 7,769 $ 5,595 $ 5,017 Income allocated to RSUs ( 33 ) ( 27 ) ( 31 ) Income allocated to common stock $ 7,736 936 $ 8.26 $ 5,568 933 $ 5.97 $ 4,986 952 $ 5.24 Potentially dilutive securities representing 3 million, 4 million and 6 million shares of common stock that were outstanding in 2021, 2020 and 2019 respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per common share during these periods because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. Investments We present investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as cash equivalents, short-term investments or other long-term assets. See Note 6 for additional information. • Cash equivalents and short-term investments – The primary objectives of our cash equivalent and short-term investment activities are to preserve capital and maintain liquidity while generating appropriate returns. We consider investments in available-for-sale debt securities with maturities of 90 days or less from the date of our investment to be cash equivalents. We consider investments in available-for-sale debt securities with maturities beyond 90 days from the date of our investment as being available for use in current operations and include them in short-term investments. 32 • Other long-term assets – Long-term investments, which are included within other long-term assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, consist of mutual funds, venture capital funds and non-marketable equity securities. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. Cost is generally computed on a currently adjusted standard cost basis, which approximates cost on a first-in, first-out basis. Standard cost is based on the normal utilization of installed factory capacity. Cost associated with underutilization of capacity is expensed as incurred. Inventory held at consignment locations is included in our finished goods inventory. We review inventory quarterly for salability and obsolescence. A statistical allowance is provided for inventory considered unlikely to be sold. The statistical allowance is based on an analysis of historical disposal activity, historical customer shipments, as well as estimated future sales. A specific allowance for each material type will be carried if there is a significant event not captured by the statistical allowance. We write off inventory in the period in which disposal occurs. Property, plant and equipment; acquisition-related intangibles; and other capitalized costs Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Our cost basis includes certain assets acquired in business combinations that were initially recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the improvements. We amortize acquisition-related intangibles on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life of the assets. Capitalized software licenses generally are amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the license. Fully depreciated or amortized assets are written off against accumulated depreciation or amortization. Impairments of long-lived assets We regularly review whether facts or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying values of property, plant and equipment or other long-lived assets, including intangible assets, are impaired. We assess the recoverability of assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with those assets to their respective carrying amounts. Any impairment charge is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. Fair value is determined by available market valuations, if applicable, or by discounted cash flows. Goodwill Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if certain impairment indicators arise. We perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, including goodwill. If, as a result of the qualitative assessment, we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. See Note 11 for additional information. Foreign currency The functional currency for our non-U.S. subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Accounts recorded in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are remeasured into the functional currency. Current assets (except inventories), deferred taxes, other long-term assets, current liabilities and long-term liabilities are remeasured at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period. Property, plant and equipment with associated depreciation and inventories are valued at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expense accounts other than depreciation for each month are calculated at the appropriate daily rate of exchange. Currency exchange gains and losses from remeasurement are credited or charged to OI&E. Derivatives and hedging We use derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to foreign exchange risk. These instruments are primarily forward foreign currency exchange contracts, which are used as economic hedges to reduce the earnings impact that exchange rate fluctuations may have on our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures. Gains and losses from changes in the fair value of these forward foreign currency exchange contracts are credited or charged to OI&E. We do not apply hedge accounting to our foreign currency derivative instruments. We are exposed to variability in compensation charges related to certain deferred compensation obligations to employees. We use total return swaps to economically hedge this exposure and offset the related compensation expense, recognizing changes in the value of the swaps and the related deferred compensation liabilities in SG&A. 33 In connection with the issuance of long-term debt, we may use financial derivatives such as treasury-rate lock agreements that are recognized in AOCI and amortized over the life of the related debt. The results of these derivative transactions were not material. We do not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. 3. Stock compensation We have stock options outstanding to participants under long-term incentive plans. The option price per share may not be less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of the grant. The options have a 10 -year term, generally vest ratably over four years and continue to vest after the option recipient retires. We also have RSUs outstanding to participants under long-term incentive plans. Each RSU represents the right to receive one share of TI common stock, issued on the vesting date, which is generally four years after the date of grant. RSUs continue to vest after the recipient retires. Holders of RSUs receive an annual cash payment equivalent to the dividends paid on our common stock. The fair value per share of RSUs is generally determined based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. We have options and RSUs outstanding to non-employee directors under director compensation plans. The plans generally provide for annual grants of stock options and RSUs, a one-time grant of RSUs to each new non-employee director and the issuance of TI common stock upon the distribution of stock units credited to director deferred compensation accounts. We also have an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) under which options are offered to all eligible employees in amounts based on a percentage of the employee’s compensation, subject to a cap. Under the plan, the option price per share is 85 % of the fair market value on the exercise date. As of December 31, 2021, 33 million shares remain available for future issuance under this plan. Total stock compensation expense recognized is as follows: For Years Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 COR $ 21 $ 21 $ 21 R&D 67 68 66 SG&A 134 135 130 Restructuring charges/other 8 — — Total 230 224 217 These amounts include expenses related to non-qualified stock options, RSUs and stock options offered under our ESPP and are net of estimated forfeitures. We recognize compensation expense for non-qualified stock options and RSUs on a straight-line basis over the minimum service period required for vesting of the award, adjusting for estimated forfeitures based on historical activity. Awards issued to employees who are retirement eligible or nearing retirement eligibility are expensed on an accelerated basis. Options issued under our ESPP are expensed over a three -month period. As of December 31, 2021, total future compensation related to equity awards not yet recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Income was $ 271 million, which we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of 1.7 years. 34 Fair value methods and assumptions We account for all awards granted under our various stock compensation plans at fair value. We estimate the fair values for non-qualified stock options using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: For Years Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Weighted average grant date fair value, per share $ 40.78 $ 25.55 $ 22.08 Weighted average assumptions used: Expected volatility 32 % 26 % 26 % Expected lives (in years) 6.7 6.8 7.1 Risk-free interest rates 0.72 % 1.53 % 2.66 % Expected dividend yields 2.41 % 2.76 % 2.95 % We use market-based measures of implied volatility to determine expected volatility on all options granted. We determine expected lives of options based on the historical option exercise experience of our option holders using a rolling 10-year average. Expected dividend yields are based on the annualized approved quarterly dividend rate and the current market price of our common stock at the time of grant. No assumption for a future dividend rate change is included unless there is an approved plan to change the dividend in the near term. Long-term incentive and director compensation plans Stock option and RSU transactions under our long-term incentive and director compensation plans are as follows: Stock Options RSUs Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price per Share Shares Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value per Share Outstanding grants, December 31, 2020 28 $ 79.69 5 $ 100.80 Granted 3 169.52 1 176.08 Stock options exercised/RSUs vested ( 6 ) 65.89 ( 2 ) 81.31 Outstanding grants, December 31, 2021 (a) 25 91.58 4 124.80 (a) Forfeited and expired shares were not material. For Years Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Weighted average grant date fair value per share for RSUs $ 176.08 $ 130.59 $ 106.58 Total grant date fair value of shares vested for RSUs $ 115 $ 110 $ 125 Aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised $ 611 $ 681 $ 819 As of December 31, 2021, 37 million shares remain available for future issuance under these plans. Summarized information about stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2021, is as follows: Stock Options Outstanding Exercise Price Range Number Outstanding (Shares) Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Life (Years) Weighted Average Exercise Price per Share $ 28.13 to 193.58 25 5.5 $ 91.58 35 Options Fully Vested and Expected to Vest (a) Options Exercisable Options outstanding (shares) 25 16 Weighted average remaining contractual life (in years) 5.5 4.2 Weighted average exercise price per share $ 90.97 $ 69.43 Intrinsic value $ 2,408 $ 1,952 (a) Includes effects of expected forfeitures. Excluding the effects of expected forfeitures, the aggregate intrinsic value of stock options outstanding was $ 2.42 billion. Effect on shares outstanding and treasury shares Treasury shares were acquired in connection with the board-authorized stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2021, $ 10.10 billion of stock repurchase authorizations remain, and no expiration date has been specified. Our practice is to issue shares of common stock from treasury shares upon exercise of stock options, distribution of director deferred compensation and vesting of RSUs. The following table reflects the changes in our treasury shares: For Years Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Balance, January 1 821 809 796 Repurchases 3 23 27 Shares issued ( 7 ) ( 11 ) ( 14 ) Balance, December 31 817 821 809 The effects on cash flows are as follows: For Years Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Proceeds from common stock transactions (a) $ 377 $ 470 $ 539 Tax benefit realized from stock compensation $ 175 $ 195 $ 224 Reduction to deferred tax asset ( 39 ) ( 44 ) ( 49 ) Excess tax benefit for stock compensation $ 136 $ 151 $ 175 (a) Net of taxes paid for employee shares withheld of $ 53 million, $ 53 million and $ 52 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 4. Income taxes Income before income taxes is comprised of the following components: For Years Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 U.S. $ 7,998 $ 5,210 $ 4,915 Non-U.S. 921 807 813 Total $ 8,919 $ 6,017 $ 5,728 36 Provision for income taxes is comprised of the following components: For Years Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Current Deferred Total Current Deferred Total Current Deferred Total U.S. federal $ 948 $ ( 23 ) $ 925 $ 357 $ ( 122 ) $ 235 $ 483 $ 25 $ 508 Non-U.S. 169 38 207 192 ( 15 ) 177 135 56 191 U.S. state 18 — 18 10 — 10 12 — 12 Total $ 1,135 $ 15 $ 1,150 $ 559 $ ( 137 ) $ 422 $ 630 $ 81 $ 711 Principal reconciling items from the U.S. statutory income tax rate to the effective tax rate (provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes) are as follows: For Years Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 U.S. statutory income tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 % U.S. tax benefit for foreign derived intangible income ( 6.1 ) ( 6.1 ) ( 4.9 ) U.S. excess tax benefit for stock compensation ( 1.5 ) ( 2.5 ) ( 3.1 ) U.S. R&D tax credit ( 0.9 ) ( 1.3 ) ( 1.4 ) Impact of changes in uncertain tax positions ( 0.2 ) ( 4.0 ) ( 0.1 ) Other 0.6 ( 0.1 ) 0.9 Effective tax rate 12.9 % 7.0 % 12.4 % The earnings represented by non-cash operating assets, such as fixed assets and inventory, will continue to be permanently reinvested outside the United States. Provisions of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act), such as the one-time tax on indefinitely reinvested earnings and the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) tax for years beginning in 2018, eliminate any additional U.S. taxation resulting from repatriation of earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries to the United States. Consequently, no U.S. tax provision has been made for the future remittance of these earnings. However, withholding or distribution taxes in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions will be incurred upon repatriation of available cash to the United States. A provision has been made for deferred taxes on these undistributed earnings to the extent that repatriation of the available cash to the United States is expected to result in a tax liability. As of December 31, 2021, we have no basis differences that would result in material unrecognized deferred tax liabilities. We have made an allowable policy election to account for the effects of GILTI as a component of income tax expense in the period in which the tax is incurred. 37 The primary components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows: December 31, 2021 2020 Deferred tax assets: Accrued expenses $ 209 $ 180 Deferred loss and tax credit carryforwards 207 207 Stock compensation 110 106 Inventories and related reserves 74 105 Retirement costs for defined benefit and retiree health care — 44 Other 40 3 Total deferred tax assets, before valuation allowance 640 645 Valuation allowance ( 188 ) ( 179 ) Total deferred tax assets, after valuation allowance 452 466 Deferred tax liabilities: Property, plant and equipment ( 197 ) ( 116 ) International earnings ( 38 ) ( 44 ) Retirement costs for defined benefit and retiree health care ( 15 ) — Acquisition-related intangibles and fair-value adjustments ( 12 ) ( 40 ) Other ( 14 ) ( 13 ) Total deferred tax liabilities ( 276 ) ( 213 ) Net deferred tax asset $ 176 $ 253 The deferred tax assets and liabilities based on tax jurisdictions are presented on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows: December 31, 2021 2020 Deferred tax assets $ 263 $ 343 Deferred tax liabilities ( 87 ) ( 90 ) Net deferred tax asset $ 176 $ 253 We make an ongoing assessment regarding the realization of U.S. and non-U.S. deferred tax assets. This assessment is based on our evaluation of relevant criteria, including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets, taxable income in prior carryback years and expectations for future taxable income. Valuation allowances increased $ 9 million in 2021, decreased $ 1 million in 2020 and increased $ 8 million in 2019. These changes had no impact to net income in 2021, 2020 or 2019. We have no material tax loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2021. Cash payments made for income taxes, net of refunds, were $ 1.20 billion, $ 720 million and $ 570 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Uncertain tax positions We operate in a number of tax jurisdictions, and our income tax returns are subject to examination by tax authorities in those jurisdictions who may challenge any item on these tax returns. Because the matters challenged by authorities are typically complex, their ultimate outcome is uncertain. Before any benefit can be recorded in our financial statements, we must determine that it is “more likely than not” that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate tax authorities. We recognize accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions and penalties as components of OI&E. 38 The changes in the total amounts of uncertain tax positions are as follows: 2021 2020 2019 Balance, January 1 $ 89 $ 303 $ 286 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 2 3 3 Additions for tax positions of prior years 7 35 63 Reductions for tax positions of prior years ( 6 ) ( 249 ) ( 41 ) Settlements with tax authorities ( 23 ) — ( 8 ) Expiration of the statute of limitations for assessing taxes — ( 3 ) — Balance, December 31 $ 69 $ 89 $ 303 Interest income (expense) recognized in the year ended December 31 $ ( 5 ) $ 39 $ 9 Interest payable as of December 31 $ 13 $ 8 $ 44 The liability for uncertain tax positions is a component of other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. All of the $ 69 million and $ 89 million liabilities for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, are comprised of positions that, if recognized, would lower the effective tax rate. If these liabilities are ultimately realized, $ 2 million of existing deferred tax assets in 2020 would also be realized. Reductions for tax positions of prior years in 2020 include a $ 249 million tax benefit for the effective settlement of a depreciation-related uncertain tax position. Accrued interest of $ 46 million related to this uncertain tax position was reversed and included in OI&E. As of December 31, 2021, the statute of limitations remains open for U.S. federal tax returns for 2017 and following years. Certain tax treaty procedures for relief from double taxation remain pending for U.S. federal tax returns for the years 2011 through 2020. In non-U.S. jurisdictions, the years open to audit represent the years still open under the statute of limitations. With respect to major jurisdictions outside the United States, our subsidiaries are no longer subject to income tax audits for years before 2012. 5. Financial instruments and risk concentration Financial instruments We hold derivative financial instruments such as forward foreign currency exchange contracts, the fair value of which was not material as of December 31, 2021. Our forward foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2021, had a notional value of $ 313 million to hedge our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures, including $ 127 million to sell Japanese yen, $ 82 million to sell British pounds and $ 42 million to sell euros. Our investments in cash equivalents, short-term investments and certain long-term investments, as well as our deferred compensation liabilities, are carried at fair value. Our postretirement plan assets are carried at fair value or net asset value per share. The carrying values for other current financial assets and liabilities, such as accounts receivable and accounts payable, approximate fair value due to the short maturity of such instruments. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of long-term debt, including the current portion, was $ 7.74 billion, and the estimated fair value was $ 8.38 billion. The estimated fair value is measured using broker-dealer quotes, which are Level 2 inputs. See Note 6 for a description of fair value and the definition of Level 2 inputs. 39 Risk concentration We are subject to counterparty risks from financial institutions, customers and issuers of debt securities. Financial instruments that could subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash deposits, cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable. To manage our credit risk exposure, we place cash investments in investment-grade debt securities and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. We also limit counterparties on cash deposits and financial derivative contracts to financial institutions with investment-grade ratings. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across different industries and geographic areas. We maintain allowances for expected returns, disputes, adjustments, incentives and credit losses. These allowances are deducted from accounts receivable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accounts receivable allowances changed to reflect amounts charged (credited) to operating results by ($ 3 ) million, $ 3 million and ($ 11 ) million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 6. Valuation of debt and equity investments and certain liabilities Investments measured at fair value Money market funds, available-for-sale debt investments and mutual funds are stated at fair value, which is generally based on market prices or broker quotes. See Fair-value considerations . Unrealized gains and losses from available-for-sale debt securities are recorded as an increase or decrease, net of taxes, in AOCI on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and any credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities are recorded as an allowance for credit losses with an offset recognized in OI&E in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Our mutual funds hold a variety of debt and equity investments intended to generate returns that offset changes in certain deferred compensation liabilities. We record changes in the fair value of these mutual funds and the related deferred compensation liabilities in SG&A. Other investments Our other investments include equity-method investments and non-marketable equity investments, which are not measured at fair value. These investments consist of interests in venture capital funds and other non-marketable equity securities. Gains and losses from equity-method investments are recognized in OI&E based on our ownership share of the investee’s financial results. Non-marketable equity securities are measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments. Gains and losses on non-marketable equity investments are recognized in OI&E. 40 Details of our investments are as follows: December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Cash and Cash Equivalents Short-Term Investments Long-Term Investments Cash and Cash Equivalents Short-Term Investments Long-Term Investments Measured at fair value: Money market funds $ 1,824 $ — $ — $ 886 $ — $ — Corporate obligations 1,060 1,070 — 256 257 — U.S. government and agency securities 642 3,388 — 1,340 3,054 — Non-U.S. government and agency securities 300 650 — — 150 — Mutual funds — — 16 — — 18 Total 3,826 5,108 16 2,482 3,461 18 Other measurement basis: Equity-method investments — — 42 — — 27 Non-marketable equity investments — — 4 — — 4 Cash on hand 805 — — 625 — — Total $ 4,631 $ 5,108 $ 62 $ 3,107 $ 3,461 $ 49 As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, unrealized gains and losses associated with our available-for-sale investments were not material. We did no t recognize any credit losses related to available-for-sale investments in 2021, 2020 or 2019. All of our debt securities classified as available for sale as of December 31 , 2021 , have maturities within one year. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, the proceeds from sales, redemptions and maturities of short-term available-for-sale investments were $ 8.48 billion, $ 5.29 billion and $ 2.31 billion, respectively. Gross realized gains and losses from these sales were not material. In 2020, we entered into total return swaps to economically hedge the variability of certain deferred compensation obligations to employees. As a result, in 2020, we received proceeds of $ 253 million from the sale of investments in mutual funds that were previously being utilized to offset this exposure. Fair-value considerations We measure and report certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The three-level hierarchy described below indicates the extent and level of judgment used to estimate fair-value measurements. • Level 1 – Uses unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. • Level 2 – Uses inputs other than Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date through correlation with market data, including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and quoted prices in markets that are not active. Level 2 also includes assets and liabilities that are valued using models or other pricing methodologies that do not require significant judgment since the input assumptions used in the models, such as interest rates and volatility factors, are corroborated by readily observable data. We utilize a third-party data service to provide Level 2 valuations. We verify these valuations for reasonableness relative to unadjusted quotes obtained from brokers or dealers based on observable prices for similar assets in active markets. 41 • Level 3 – Uses inputs that are unobservable, supported by little or no market activity and reflect the use of significant management judgment. These values are generally determined using pricing models that utilize management estimates of market participant assumptions. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had no Level 3 assets or liabilities. The following are our assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis. These tables do not include cash on hand, assets held by our postretirement plans, or assets and liabilities that are measured at historical cost or any basis other than fair value. December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Level 1 Level 2 Total Level 1 Level 2 Total Assets: Money market funds $ 1,824 $ — $ 1,824 $ 886 $ — $ 886 Corporate obligations — 2,130 2,130 — 513 513 U.S. government and agency securities 3,629 401 4,030 4,394 — 4,394 Non-U.S. government and agency securities — 950 950 — 150 150 Mutual funds 16 — 16 18 — 18 Total assets $ 5,469 $ 3,481 $ 8,950 $ 5,298 $ 663 $ 5,961 Liabilities: Deferred compensation $ 395 $ — $ 395 $ 350 $ — $ 350 Total liabilities $ 395 $ — $ 395 $ 350 $ — $ 350 7. Postretirement benefit plans Plan descriptions We have various employee retirement plans, including defined contribution, defined benefit and retiree health care benefit plans. For qualifying employees, we offer deferred compensation arrangements. U.S. retirement plans Our principal retirement plans in the United States are a defined contribution plan, an enhanced defined contribution plan and qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans. The defined benefit plans were closed to new participants in 1997, and then current participants were allowed to make a one-time election to continue accruing a benefit in the plans or to cease accruing a benefit and instead to participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan. Both defined contribution plans offer an employer-matching savings option that allows employees to make pretax and post-tax contributions to various investment choices. Employees who elected to continue accruing a benefit in the qualified defined benefit pension plans may also participate in the defined contribution plan, where employer-matching contributions are provided for up to 2 % of the employee’s annual eligible earnings. Employees who elected not to continue accruing a benefit in the defined benefit pension plans and employees hired after November 1997 and through December 31, 2003, may participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan. This plan provides for a fixed employer contribution of 2 % of the employee’s annual eligible earnings, plus an employer-matching contribution of up to 4 % of the employee’s annual eligible earnings. Employees hired after December 31, 2003, do not receive the fixed employer contribution of 2 % of the employee’s annual eligible earnings. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, as a result of employees’ elections, TI’s U.S. defined contribution plans held shares of TI common stock totaling 6 million shares and 7 million shares valued at $ 1.16 billion and $ 1.12 billion, respectively. Dividends paid on these shares in both 2021 and 2020 were $ 27 million. Effective April 1, 2016, the TI common stock fund was frozen to new contributions or transfers into the fund. Our aggregate expense for the U.S. defined contribution plans was $ 63 million in 2021 and $ 61 million in 2020 and 2019. 42 The defined benefit pension plans include employees still accruing benefits, as well as employees and participants who no longer accrue service-related benefits, but instead, may participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan. Benefits under the qualified defined benefit pension plan are determined using a formula based on years of service and the highest five consecutive years of compensation. We intend to contribute amounts to this plan to meet the minimum funding requirements of applicable local laws and regulations, plus such additional amounts as we deem appropriate. The non-qualified defined benefit plans are unfunded and closed to new participants. U.S. retiree health care benefit plan U.S. employees who meet eligibility requirements are offered medical coverage during retirement. We make a contribution toward the cost of those retiree medical benefits for certain retirees and their dependents. The contribution rates are based upon various factors, the most important of which are an employee’s date of hire, date of retirement, years of service and eligibility for Medicare benefits. The balance of the cost is borne by the plan’s participants. Employees hired after January 1, 2001, are responsible for the full cost of their medical benefits during retirement. Non-U.S. retirement plans We provide retirement coverage for non-U.S. employees, as required by local laws or to the extent we deem appropriate, through a number of defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Retirement benefits are generally based on an employee’s years of service and compensation. Funding requirements are determined on an individual country and plan basis and are subject to local country practices and market circumstances. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, as a result of employees’ elections, TI’s non-U.S. defined contribution plans held TI common stock valued at $ 38 million and $ 36 million, respectively. Dividends paid on these shares of TI common stock in 2021 and 2020 were not material. Effects on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Balance Sheets Expenses related to defined benefit and retiree health care benefit plans are as follows: U.S. Defined Benefit U.S. Retiree Health Care Non-U.S. Defined Benefit 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 2019 Service cost $ 21 $ 18 $ 18 $ 3 $ 3 $ 3 $ 36 $ 34 $ 31 Interest cost 30 31 38 10 13 14 37 38 43 Expected return on plan assets ( 31 ) ( 36 ) ( 41 ) ( 9 ) ( 12 ) ( 14 ) ( 81 ) ( 78 ) ( 86 ) Amortization of prior service cost (credit) — — — ( 2 ) ( 2 ) ( 1 ) 1 1 1 Recognized net actuarial loss 15 7 9 — — — 7 14 29 Net periodic benefit costs 35 20 24 2 2 2 — 9 18 Settlement losses 13 16 10 — — — 2 1 3 Total, including other postretirement losses $ 48 $ 36 $ 34 $ 2 $ 2 $ 2 $ 2 $ 10 $ 21 All defined benefit and retiree health care benefit plan expense components other than service cost are recognized in OI&E in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Service cost is recognized within operating profit. For the U.S. qualified pension and retiree health care plans, the expected return on plan assets component of net periodic benefit cost is based upon a market-related value of assets. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the market-related value of assets is the fair value adjusted by a smoothing technique whereby certain gains and losses are phased in over a period of three years . 43 Changes in the benefit obligations and plan assets for defined benefit and retiree health care benefit plans are as follows: U.S. Defined Benefit U.S. Retiree Health Care Non-U.S. Defined Benefit 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 Change in plan benefit obligation Benefit obligation at beginning of year: $ 1,097 $ 960 $ 389 $ 359 $ 2,868 $ 2,581 Service cost 21 18 3 3 36 34 Interest cost 30 31 10 13 37 38 Participant contributions — — 14 13 9 7 Benefits paid ( 12 ) ( 12 ) ( 38 ) ( 39 ) ( 101 ) ( 95 ) Settlements ( 162 ) ( 94 ) — — ( 12 ) ( 8 ) Actuarial loss (gain) ( 79 ) 194 ( 18 ) 40 ( 111 ) 143 Plan amendments — — — — — 1 Effects of exchange rate changes — — — — ( 152 ) 167 Benefit obligation at end of year $ 895 $ 1,097 $ 360 $ 389 $ 2,574 $ 2,868 Change in plan assets Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year: $ 1,061 $ 987 $ 389 $ 356 $ 3,008 $ 2,661 Actual return on plan assets 37 164 19 58 75 260 Employer contributions (qualified plans) — — 1 1 7 11 Employer contributions (non-qualified plans) 10 16 — — — — Participant contributions — — 14 13 9 7 Benefits paid ( 12 ) ( 12 ) ( 38 ) ( 39 ) ( 101 ) ( 95 ) Settlements ( 162 ) ( 94 ) — — ( 12 ) ( 8 ) Effects of exchange rate changes — — — — ( 173 ) 172 Fair value of plan assets at end of year $ 934 $ 1,061 $ 385 $ 389 $ 2,813 $ 3,008 Funded status at end of year $ 39 $ ( 36 ) $ 25 $ — $ 239 $ 140 Changes in actuarial gains and losses in the projected benefit obligations are generally driven by discount rate movement. Amounts recognized on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, are as follows: U.S. Defined Benefit U.S. Retiree Health Care Non-U.S. Defined Benefit Total 2021 Overfunded retirement plans $ 73 $ 28 $ 291 $ 392 Accrued expenses and other liabilities & other long-term liabilities ( 5 ) — ( 5 ) ( 10 ) Underfunded retirement plans ( 29 ) ( 3 ) ( 47 ) ( 79 ) Funded status at end of 2021 $ 39 $ 25 $ 239 $ 303 2020 Overfunded retirement plans $ 9 $ 3 $ 234 $ 246 Accrued expenses and other liabilities & other long-term liabilities ( 6 ) — ( 5 ) ( 11 ) Underfunded retirement plans ( 39 ) ( 3 ) ( 89 ) ( 131 ) Funded status at end of 2020 $ ( 36 ) $ — $ 140 $ 104 Contributions to the plans meet or exceed all minimum funding requirements. We expect to contribute about $ 10 million to our retirement benefit plans in 2022. 44 Accumulated benefit obligations, which are generally less than the projected benefit obligations as they exclude the impact of future salary increases, were $ 820 million and $ 992 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, for the U.S. defined benefit plans, and $ 2.47 billion and $ 2.72 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, for the non-U.S. defined benefit plans.

The tables below set forth the fair value of our plan assets using the same three-level hierarchy of fair-value inputs described in Note 6.

The investments in our major benefit plans largely consist of low-cost, broad-market index funds to mitigate risks of concentration within market sectors. Our investment policy is designed to better match the interest rate sensitivity of the plan assets and liabilities. The appropriate mix of equity and bond investments is determined primarily through the use of detailed asset-liability modeling studies that look to balance the impact of changes in the discount rate against the need to provide asset growth to cover future service cost. Most of our plans around the world have a greater proportion of fixed income securities with return characteristics that are more closely aligned with changes in the liabilities caused by discount rate volatility. Assumptions and investment policies U.S. Defined Benefit U.S. Retiree Health Care Non-U.S. Defined Benefit 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 Weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations: Discount rate 2.74 % 2.81 % 3.05 % 2.74 % 1.57 % 1.31 % Long-term pay progression 3.70 % 3.70 % n/a n/a 3.15 % 3.15 % Weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost: Discount rate 2.95 % 3.42 % 2.74 % 3.63 % 1.31 % 1.46 % Long-term rate of return on plan assets 3.50 % 4.00 % 3.10 % 3.50 % 2.82 % 2.93 % Long-term pay progression 3.70 % 3.30 % n/a n/a 3.15 % 3.06 % We utilize a variety of methods to select an appropriate discount rate depending on the depth of the corporate bond market in the country in which the benefit plan operates. In the United States, we use a settlement approach whereby a portfolio of bonds is selected from the universe of actively traded high-quality U.S. corporate bonds. The selected portfolio is designed to provide cash flows sufficient to pay the plan’s expected benefit payments when due. The resulting discount rate reflects the rate of return of the selected portfolio of bonds. For our non-U.S. locations with a sufficient number of actively traded high-quality bonds, an analysis is performed in which the projected cash flows from the defined benefit plans are discounted against a yield curve constructed with an appropriate universe of high-quality corporate bonds available in each country. In this manner, a present value is developed. The discount rate selected is the single equivalent rate that produces the same present value. For countries that lack a sufficient corporate bond market, a government bond index is used to establish the discount rate. 46 Assumptions for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets are based on future expectations for returns for each asset class and the effect of periodic target asset allocation rebalancing. We adjust the results for the payment of reasonable expenses of the plan from plan assets. We believe our assumptions are appropriate based on the investment mix and long-term nature of the plans’ investments. Assumptions used for the non-U.S. defined benefit plans reflect the different economic environments within the various countries. The target allocation ranges for the plans that hold a substantial majority of the defined benefit assets are as follows: U.S. Defined Benefit U.S. Retiree Health Care Non-U.S. Defined Benefit Fixed income securities and cash equivalents 65 % – 80 % 65 % – 80 % 60 % – 100 % Equity securities 20 % – 35 % 20 % – 35 % 0 % – 40 % We rebalance the plans’ investments when they are outside the target allocation ranges. Weighted average asset allocations as of December 31 are as follows: U.S. Defined Benefit U.S. Retiree Health Care Non-U.S. Defined Benefit 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 Fixed income securities and cash equivalents 70 % 70 % 64 % 65 % 79 % 76 % Equity securities 30 % 30 % 36 % 35 % 21 % 24 % None of the plan assets related to the defined benefit pension plans and retiree health care benefit plan are directly invested in TI common stock. The following assumed future benefit payments to plan participants in the next 10 years are used to measure our benefit obligations. Almost all of the payments, which may vary significantly from these assumptions, will be made from plan assets and not from company assets. 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 – 2031 U.S. Defined Benefit $ 89 $ 96 $ 87 $ 87 $ 87 $ 391 U.S. Retiree Health Care 28 27 26 25 24 108 Non-U.S. Defined Benefit 99 101 103 105 107 566 Assumed health care cost trend rates for the U.S. retiree health care benefit plan as of December 31 are as follows: 2021 2020 Assumed health care cost trend rate for next year 6.50 % 6.75 % Ultimate trend rate 5.00 % 5.00 % Year in which ultimate trend rate is reached 2028 2028 Deferred compensation plans We have deferred compensation plans that allow U.S. employees whose base salary and management responsibility exceed a certain level to defer receipt of a portion of their cash compensation. Payments under these plans are made based on the participant’s distribution election and plan balance. Participants can earn a return on their deferred compensation based on notional investments in the same investment funds that are offered in our defined contribution plans. As of December 31, 2021, our liability to participants of the deferred compensation plans was $ 395 million and is recorded in other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. This amount reflects the accumulated participant deferrals and earnings thereon as of that date. We utilize total return swaps and investments in mutual funds that serve as economic hedges of our exposure to changes in the fair value of these liabilities. We record changes in the fair value of the liability and the related total return swaps and mutual funds in SG&A, as discussed in Note 6. As of December 31, 2021, we held $ 16 million in mutual funds related to these plans that are recorded in long-term investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 47 8. Debt and lines of credit Short-term borrowings We maintain a line of credit to support commercial paper borrowings, if any, and to provide additional liquidity through bank loans. As of December 31, 2021, we had a variable-rate revolving credit facility from a consortium of investment-grade banks that allows us to borrow up to $ 2 billion until March 2024. As of December 31, 2021, our credit facility was undrawn, and we had no commercial paper outstanding. Long-term debt In February 2021, we retired $ 550 million of maturing debt. In September 2021, we issued three series of senior unsecured notes for an aggregate principal amount of $ 1.5 billion, consisting of $ 500 million of 1.125 % notes due in 2026, $ 500 million of 1.90 % notes due in 2031 and $ 500 million of 2.70 % notes due in 2051.

Cash payments for interest on long-term debt were $ 181 million, $ 182 million and $ 156 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Capitalized interest was not material. 9. Leases We conduct certain operations in leased facilities and also lease a portion of our data processing and other equipment. In addition, certain long-term supply agreements to purchase industrial gases are accounted for as operating leases. Lease agreements frequently include renewal provisions and require us to pay real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs. Our leases are included as a component of the following balance sheet lines: December 31, 2021 2020 Other long-term assets $ 465 $ 319 Accrued expenses and other liabilities $ 82 $ 72 Other long-term liabilities 383 249 49 Details of our operating leases are as follows: For Years Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Lease cost related to lease liabilities $ 69 $ 70 $ 66 Variable lease cost 56 36 41 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities: Operating cash flows for lease cost $ 61 $ 59 $ 60 Lease assets obtained in exchange for new lease liabilities $ 210 $ 59 $ 167 As of December 31, 2021, we had committed to make the following minimum payments under our non-cancellable operating leases: 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Thereafter Total Lease payments $ 84 $ 72 $ 60 $ 50 $ 45 $ 214 $ 525 Imputed lease interest ( 60 ) Total lease liabilities $ 465 The weighted-average remaining lease term was 9.2 years and 8.9 years as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Commitments and contingencies Purchase commitments Our purchase commitments include payments for software licenses and contractual arrangements with suppliers when there is a fixed, non-cancellable payment schedule or when minimum payments are due with a reduced delivery schedule. As of December 31, 2021, we had committed to make the following minimum payments under our purchase commitments: 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Thereafter Total Purchase commitments $ 564 $ 436 $ 433 $ 43 $ 26 $ 74 $ 1,576 Indemnification guarantees We routinely sell products with an intellectual property indemnification included in the terms of sale. Historically, we have had only minimal, infrequent losses associated with these indemnities. Consequently, we cannot reasonably estimate any future liabilities that may result. Warranty costs/product liabilities We accrue for known product-related claims if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. During the periods presented, there have been no material accruals or payments regarding product warranty or product liability. Historically, we have experienced a low rate of payments on product claims. Although we cannot predict the likelihood or amount of any future claims, we do not believe they will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Our stated warranties for semiconductor products obligate us to repair, replace or credit the purchase price of a covered product back to the buyer. Product claim consideration may exceed the price of our products. 50 General We are subject to various legal and administrative proceedings. Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of these matters, we believe that the results of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 11. Supplemental financial information Restructuring charges/other Restructuring charges/other are included in Other for segment reporting purposes and are comprised of the following components: For Years Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Restructuring charges (a) $ — $ 25 $ ( 15 ) Integration charges (b) 104 — — Gains on sales of assets (c) ( 50 ) ( 1 ) ( 21 ) Restructuring charges/other $ 54 $ 24 $ ( 36 ) (a) Includes severance and benefits, accelerated depreciation, changes in estimates and other exit costs.

The restructuring accrual balances are reported as a component of either accrued expenses and other liabilities or other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, depending on the expected timing of payment. In 2020, we recognized $ 25 million of restructuring charges primarily for severance and benefit costs associated with our Embedded Processing business. As of December 31, 2021, $ 21 million of payments have been made. In 2020, we announced a multiyear plan to close our two remaining factories with 150-millimeter production, located in Sherman and Dallas, Texas. During 2021 we decided not to close a portion of our factory in Dallas. We expect this plan to be completed no later than 2025. Charges for the closures cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. 51 Other income (expense), net (OI&E) For Years Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Other income (a) $ 145 $ 327 $ 201 Other expense (b) ( 2 ) ( 14 ) ( 26 ) Total $ 143 $ 313 $ 175 (a) Other income includes royalty and lease income, investment gains and losses, interest income, as well as reversals of tax interest accruals.

The estimated fair value of assets acquired was determined based on market comparable information to purchase or build comparable assets and allocated on a relative basis to purchase consideration. Assets acquired included $ 28 million of land, $ 305 million of buildings and improvements and $ 526 million of machinery and equipment. Goodwill Goodwill by segment as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, is as follows: Goodwill Analog $ 4,158 Embedded Processing 172 Other 32 Total $ 4,362 We perform our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter and determine whether the fair value of each of our reporting units is in excess of its carrying value. In 2021, we elected to perform a qualitative analysis to assess impairment of goodwill rather than to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The key qualitative factors considered in the assessment included the change in the industry and competitive environment, market capitalization and overall financial performance. Based on this qualitative analysis, we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, we determined no impairment was indicated.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 4, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical audit matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates. 54 Uncertain tax positions Description of the matter As discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company operates in the United States and multiple international tax jurisdictions, and its income tax returns are subject to examination by tax authorities in those jurisdictions who may challenge any tax position on these returns. Uncertainty in a tax position may arise because tax laws are subject to interpretation. The Company uses significant judgment to (1) determine whether, based on the technical merits, a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and (2) measure the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. Auditing management’s estimate of the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition involved auditor judgment because management’s estimate is complex, requires a high degree of judgment and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings. How we addressed the matter in our audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s accounting process for uncertain tax positions. For example, this included controls over the Company’s assessment of the technical merits of tax positions and management’s process to measure the benefit of those tax positions. Among other procedures performed, we involved our tax professionals to assess the technical merits of the Company’s tax positions. This included assessing the Company’s correspondence with the relevant tax authorities and evaluating income tax opinions or other third-party advice obtained by the Company. We also evaluated the appropriateness of the Company’s accounting for its tax positions taking into consideration relevant international and local income tax laws and legal rulings. We analyzed the Company’s assumptions and data used to determine the amount of tax benefit to recognize and tested the accuracy of the calculations. We also evaluated the adequacy of the Company’s financial statement disclosures in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements related to these tax matters. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1952. Dallas, Texas February 4, 2022 55 ITEM 9. Changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure Not applicable. ITEM 9A. Controls and procedures Disclosure controls and procedures An evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that those disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Internal control over financial reportin g Report by management on internal control over financial reporting The management of TI is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. TI’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements issued for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2021 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. TI management assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria) in Internal Control − Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2021, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on the COSO criteria. TI’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which immediately follows this report. 56 Report of independent registered public accounting firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Texas Instruments Incorporated Opinion on internal control over financial reporting We have audited Texas Instruments Incorporated’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Texas Instruments Incorporated (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes, and our report dated February 4, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying report by management on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Dallas, Texas February 4, 2022 57 ITEM 9B.

These forward-looking statements generally can be identified by phrases such as TI or its management “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “foresees,” “forecasts,” “estimates” or other words or phrases of similar import. Similarly, statements herein that describe TI’s business strategy, outlook, objectives, plans, intentions or goals also are forward-looking statements. All such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements. We urge you to carefully consider the following important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations of TI or our management: • The duration and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic, government and other third-party responses to it and the consequences for the global economy, including to our business and the businesses of our suppliers, customers and distributors; • Economic, social and political conditions, and natural events in the countries in which we, our customers or our suppliers operate, including global trade policies; • Market demand for semiconductors, particularly in the industrial and automotive markets, and customer demand that differs from forecasts; • Our ability to compete in products and prices in an intensely competitive industry; • Evolving cybersecurity and other threats relating to our information technology systems or those of our customers, vendors and other third parties; • Our ability to successfully implement and realize opportunities from strategic, business and organizational changes, or our ability to realize our expectations regarding the amount and timing of associated restructuring charges and cost savings; • Our ability to develop, manufacture and market innovative products in a rapidly changing technological environment, our timely implementation of new manufacturing technologies and installation of manufacturing equipment, and our ability to realize expected returns on significant investments in manufacturing capacity; • Availability and cost of raw materials, utilities, manufacturing equipment, third-party manufacturing services and manufacturing technology; • Product liability, warranty or other claims relating to our products, software, manufacturing, delivery, services, design or communications, or recalls by our customers for a product containing one of our parts; • Compliance with or changes in the complex laws, rules and regulations to which we are or may become subject, or actions of enforcement authorities, that restrict our ability to operate our business or subject us to fines, penalties or other legal liability; • Changes in tax law and accounting standards that impact the tax rate applicable to us, the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed, adverse resolution of tax audits, increases in tariff rates, and the ability to realize deferred tax assets; • Financial difficulties of our distributors or semiconductor distributors’ promotion of competing product lines to our detriment; or disputes with current or former distributors; • Losses or curtailments of purchases from key customers or the timing and amount of customer inventory adjustments; • Our ability to maintain or improve profit margins, including our ability to utilize our manufacturing facilities at sufficient levels to cover our fixed operating costs, in an intensely competitive and cyclical industry and changing regulatory environment; • Our ability to maintain and enforce a strong intellectual property portfolio and maintain freedom of operation in all jurisdictions where we conduct business; or our exposure to infringement claims; • Instability in the global credit and financial markets; • Our ability to recruit and retain skilled personnel, and effectively manage key employee succession; and 62 • Impairments of our non-financial assets. For a more detailed discussion of these factors, see the Risk factors discussion in Item 1A of this report.

PART I ITEM 1. Business We design and make semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. Our operations began in 1930, and we are incorporated in Delaware. With headquarters in Dallas, Texas, we have design, manufacturing or sales operations in more than 30 countries. Our two reportable segments are Analog and Embedded Processing, and we report the results of our remaining business activities in Other. In 2020, we generated $14.46 billion of revenue. For decades, we have operated with a passion to create a better world by making electronics more affordable through semiconductors. We were pioneers in the transition from vacuum tubes to transistors and then to integrated circuits. As each generation became more reliable, more affordable and lower in power, semiconductors were used by a growing number of customers and markets. This passion is alive today as we help our customers develop electronics and new applications, particularly in industrial and automotive markets. For many years, we have run our business with three overarching ambitions in mind. First, we will act like owners who will own the company for decades. Second, we will adapt and succeed in a world that is ever changing. And third, we will be a company that we are personally proud to be a part of and that we would want as our neighbor. When we are successful in achieving these ambitions, our employees, customers, communities and shareholders all win. As engineers, we are fortunate to work on exciting technology which helps our customers innovate to create a better world. Technology is the foundation of our company, but ultimately, our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate long-term value for owners is the growth of free cash flow per share. Our strategy to maximize free cash flow per share growth has three elements: The first element of our strategy is a business model that is focused on analog and embedded processing products and built around four competitive advantages. This business model is the result of a series of strategic decisions made over the years and that continue today. The four sustainable competitive advantages are a strong foundation of manufacturing and technology, a broad portfolio of analog and embedded processing products, the reach of our market channels, and diversity and longevity of our products, markets and customer positions. In combination, these four competitive advantages provide tangible benefits, are difficult to replicate and ultimately separate us from our best peers. Together, these competitive advantages help position TI in a unique class of companies capable of generating and returning significant amounts of cash for our owners. We make our investments with an eye towards long-term strengthening and leveraging of these advantages. The second element of our strategy to maximize free cash flow per share growth is disciplined allocation of capital. This spans how we select R&D projects, develop new capabilities like TI.com, invest in new manufacturing capacity or how we think about acquisitions and returning cash to our owners. Over a 10-year period from 2011 to 2020, we allocated $83 billion, which reinforces the importance of discipline in capital allocation. The largest allocation over this period was to drive organic growth, which includes investments in R&D, sales and marketing, capital expenditures and working capital for inventory. Beyond that, we also allocated capital to dividends and share repurchases. Dividends are designed to appeal to a broad set of investors, and share repurchases are made with the goal of the accretive capture of future free cash flow for long-term investors. Lastly, we allocate to acquisitions for inorganic growth, which we last did in 2011 when we acquired National Semiconductor. The third element of our strategy is efficiency, which we think of as constantly striving for more output for every dollar spent. This is about getting our investments in the most impactful areas to maximize the growth of long-term free cash flow per share; it is not just about optimizing cost-cutting to get to the last dollar of expense. We bring this philosophy of efficiency and continuous improvement to all areas of the company, and this focus on efficiency contributes to revenue growth, improved gross margins, disciplined R&D and SG&A expense, free cash flow margins and ultimately to free cash flow per share growth. We believe that our business model with the combined effect of our four competitive advantages sets TI apart from our peers and will for a long time to come. We will invest to strengthen our competitive advantages, be disciplined in capital allocation and stay diligent in our pursuit of efficiencies. Finally, we will remain focused on the belief that long-term growth of free cash flow per share is the ultimate measure to generate value. 2 Product information Semiconductors are electronic components that serve as the building blocks inside modern electronic systems and equipment. Semiconductors, generally known as “chips,” combine multiple transistors to form a complete electronic circuit. We have a diverse product portfolio that is used to accomplish many different things, such as converting and amplifying signals, interfacing with other devices, managing and distributing power, processing data, canceling noise and improving signal resolution. This broad portfolio includes approximately 80,000 products that are integral to almost every type of electronic equipment. Our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels. Our segments also reflect how management allocates resources and measures results. Analog Our Analog segment generated $10.89 billion of revenue in 2020. Analog semiconductors change real-world signals, such as sound, temperature, pressure or images, by conditioning them, amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors. Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in all electronic equipment by converting, distributing, storing, discharging, isolating and measuring electrical energy, whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or using a battery. As the digitization of electronics continues, there is a growing need and opportunity for analog chips to provide the power to run devices and the critical interfaces with human beings, the real world and other electronic devices. Our Analog products are used in many markets, particularly industrial, automotive and personal electronics. Sales of our Analog products generated about 75% of our revenue in 2020. Our Analog segment includes the following major product lines: Power and Signal Chain. Power Power includes products that help customers manage power in electronic systems in all end markets. Our broad portfolio is designed to manage power requirements across different voltage levels, including battery-management solutions, DC/DC switching regulators, AC/DC and isolated controllers and converters, power switches, linear regulators, voltage supervisors, voltage references and lighting products. Signal Chain Signal Chain includes products that sense, condition and measure real-world signals to allow information to be transferred or converted for further processing and control. Our Signal Chain products, which serve a variety of end markets, include amplifiers, data converters, interface products, motor drives, clocks, logic and sensing products. Embedded Processing Our Embedded Processing segment generated $2.57 billion of revenue in 2020. Embedded Processing products are the digital “brains” of many types of electronic equipment. They are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for various combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application. Our devices vary from simple, low-cost microcontrollers used in applications such as electric toothbrushes to highly specialized, complex devices such as motor control. Our Embedded Processing products are used in many markets, particularly industrial and automotive. An important characteristic of our Embedded Processing products is that our customers often invest their own research and development (R&D) to write software that operates on our products. This investment tends to increase the length of our customer relationships because many customers prefer to reuse software from one product generation to the next. Sales of Embedded Processing products generated about 18% of our revenue in 2020. Our Embedded Processing segment includes microcontrollers, digital signal processors (DSPs) and applications processors. Microcontrollers are self-contained systems with a processor core, memory and peripherals that are designed to control a set of specific tasks for electronic equipment. DSPs perform mathematical computations almost instantaneously to process or improve digital data. Applications processors are designed for specific computing activity. 3 Other We report the results of our remaining business activities in Other, which includes operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for individually reportable segments and cannot be aggregated with other operating segments. Other generated $1.01 billion of revenue in 2020 and includes revenue from DLP ® products (primarily used to project high-definition images), calculators and certain custom semiconductors known as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). In Other, we also include items that are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments. Examples of these items include acquisition charges, restructuring charges and certain corporate-level items, such as litigation expenses, environmental costs and gains and losses from other activities, including asset dispositions. Markets for our products The table below lists the major markets for our products in 2020 and the estimated percentage of our 2020 revenue that the market represented. The chart also lists, in declining order of our revenue, the sectors within each market. Market Sector Industrial Factory automation & control (37% of TI revenue) Medical Building automation Grid infrastructure Aerospace & defense Appliances Test & measurement Motor drives Power delivery Pro audio, video & signage Retail automation & payment Industrial transport Lighting Automotive Infotainment & cluster (20% of TI revenue) Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) Hybrid, electric & powertrain systems Passive safety Body electronics & lighting Personal electronics Mobile phones (27% of TI revenue) PC & notebooks Portable electronics Connected peripherals & printers TV Home theater & entertainment Tablets Wearables (non-medical) Data storage Gaming Communications equipment Wireless infrastructure (8% of TI revenue) Wired networking Broadband fixed line access Datacom module Enterprise systems Data center & enterprise computing (6% of TI revenue) Enterprise projectors Enterprise machine Other (calculators and other) (2% of TI revenue) 4 Market characteristics Competitive landscape Despite recent consolidation, the analog and embedded processing markets remain highly fragmented. As a result, we face significant global competition from dozens of large and small companies, including both broad-based suppliers and niche suppliers. Our competitors also include emerging companies, particularly in Asia. We believe that competitive performance in the semiconductor market generally depends on several factors, including the breadth of a company’s product line, the strength and reach of its channels to market, technological innovation, product development execution, technical support, customer service, quality, reliability, price and manufacturing capacity and capabilities. In addition, manufacturing process and package technologies that provide differentiated levels of performance and a structural cost advantage are competitive factors for our analog products, and customers’ prior investments in software development is a competitive factor for our embedded processing products. Market cycle The “semiconductor cycle” refers to the ebb and flow of supply and demand and the building and depleting of inventories. The semiconductor market historically has been characterized by periods of tight supply caused by strengthening demand and/or insufficient manufacturing capacity, followed by periods of surplus inventory caused by weakening demand and/or excess manufacturing capacity. These are typically referred to as upturns and downturns in the semiconductor cycle. A semiconductor cycle could be affected by the significant time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing facilities. We employ several strategies which have many benefits, including dampening the effect of the semiconductor cycle on TI. As an example, we are focused on building closer direct relationships with customers. When it comes to market cycles, these relationships provide improved insight into customer demand and allow us to more accurately and efficiently manage factory loadings and inventory levels, which lead to more stable lead times and higher product availability. Finally, we focus our resources on analog and embedded processing products and industrial and automotive markets. Generally, our products serve a large and diverse customer base, which reduces our dependence on the performance of any single product, market or customer. In addition, they typically have long shelf lives and low risk of obsolescence. Industrial and automotive markets also benefit from long product life cycles, with revenue often lasting 10 years or more, which help to smooth the impact of cyclicality. Seasonality Our revenue is subject to some seasonal variation. Historically, our sequential revenue growth rate tends to be weaker in the first and fourth quarters when compared with the second and third quarters. Customers, sales and distribution We sell our products to over 100,000 customers. Our customer base is diverse, with more than one-third of our revenue derived from customers outside our largest 100. We market and sell our products through direct sales channels, including our website and broad sales and applications team, and through distributors. Over the past several years, we have been investing in new capabilities and evolving our distribution network to better align with our strategy to establish closer direct relationships with our customers. With less business flowing through the distribution channel, we require fewer distributors. During 2020, we completed our transition to a single worldwide distributor, coupled with a few region-specific distributors, for order fulfillment. Building closer direct customer relationships strengthens our reach of market channel advantage, which gives us access to more customers and more of their design projects, leading to the opportunity to sell more of our products into each design. Additionally, broader and deeper access gives us better insight and knowledge of customer needs. Our investments in new and improved capabilities to directly support our customers include website and e-commerce enhancements as well as inventory consignment programs and order fulfillment services. 5 Manufacturing Semiconductor manufacturing begins with a sequence of photolithographic and chemical processing steps that fabricate a number of semiconductor devices on a thin silicon wafer. Each device on the wafer is packaged and tested. The entire process takes place in highly specialized facilities that require substantial investments. We own and operate semiconductor manufacturing facilities in North America, Asia, Japan and Europe. These include both wafer fabrication and assembly/test facilities. We invest in manufacturing technologies and do most of our manufacturing in-house. This strategic decision to make manufacturing and technology a core competitive advantage delivers tangible benefits of lower manufacturing costs and greater control of our supply chain. We have focused on creating a competitive manufacturing structural cost advantage by investing in our advanced analog 300-millimeter capacity. An unpackaged chip built on 300-millimeter wafers costs about 40% less than an unpackaged chip built on 200-millimeter wafers. To strengthen this advantage, construction is underway on our new 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facility in Richardson, Texas, as 300-millimeter wafers will continue to support the majority of our Analog growth. We assess and are careful to address potential health, safety, and environmental risks presented by our operations, including our manufacturing operations. We care for our environment and work to prevent pollution and the potential risks related to climate change by implementing practices such as recycling and reusing materials, controlling harmful emissions, and properly handling hazardous and restricted substances. We expect to continue to maintain sufficient internal manufacturing capacity to meet the majority of our production needs and to obtain manufacturing equipment to support new technology developments and revenue growth. To supplement our manufacturing capacity and maximize our responsiveness to customer demand, we selectively use the capacity of outside suppliers, commonly known as foundries, and subcontractors. In 2020, we sourced about 20% of our total wafers from external foundries and about 40% of our assembly/test services from subcontractors. Inventory Our objectives for inventory are to maintain high levels of customer service, maintain stable and competitive lead times, minimize inventory obsolescence and improve manufacturing asset utilization. To meet these objectives and to allow greater flexibility in periods of high demand, we build ahead of demand our broad-based products that are used across a diverse set of applications and customers and have low risk of obsolescence. Inventory levels will vary based on market conditions and seasonality. Raw materials We purchase materials, parts and supplies from a number of suppliers. In some cases we purchase such items from sole-source suppliers. The materials, parts and supplies essential to our business are generally available at present, and we believe that such materials, parts and supplies will be available in the foreseeable future. Intellectual property We own many patents and have many patent applications pending in the United States and other countries in fields relating to our business. We have developed a strong, broad-based patent portfolio and continually add patents to that portfolio. We also have license agreements, which vary in duration, involving rights to our portfolio or those of other companies. We do not consider our business materially dependent upon any one patent or patent license. 6 Executive officers of the Registrant The following is an alphabetical list of the names and ages of the executive officers of the company and the positions or offices with the company held by each person named: Name Age Position Ahmad S.

Risk factors You should read the following risk factors in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and in materials incorporated by reference into these filings. These risk factors are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to TI, a company with broad international operations. Like many companies, we are susceptible to a potential downturn associated with macroeconomic weakness, which may affect our performance and the performance of our customers. Similarly, the price of our securities is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions, actual financial results that do not meet our and/or the investment community’s expectations, changes in our and/or the investment community’s expectations for our future results, dividends or share repurchases, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Risks related to our business and industry The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition is uncertain. The global spread of the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the coronavirus disease, COVID-19, has created significant uncertainty and economic disruption, both near-term and potentially long-term. We have modified, and might further modify, our business practices in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, related third-party responses, including from government authorities and our suppliers, customers and distributors, and the economic and social ramifications of the disease and societal responses across the markets in which TI operates. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to affect our business, results of operation and financial condition is difficult to predict and depends on numerous evolving factors including: the duration and scope of the pandemic; government, social, business and other actions that have been and will be taken in response to the pandemic; and the effect of the pandemic on short- and long-term general economic conditions. We might experience short- or long-term constrained supply or volatility in customer demand, which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results in future periods. Our global operations subject us to risks associated with domestic or international political, social, economic or other conditions. We have facilities in more than 30 countries. About 90% of our revenue comes from shipments to locations outside the United States; shipments of products to China-based customers represent about 20% of our revenue. Certain countries where we operate have experienced, and other countries may experience, trade tension that affects global trade and macroeconomic conditions through the enactment of tariffs, import or export restrictions, trade embargoes and sanctions, restrictions on cross-border investment and other trade barriers. Trade tensions impact our ability to deliver products and product support into China, cause Chinese customers to seek alternate suppliers and could otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial results. We are exposed to political, social and economic conditions, security risks, terrorism or other hostile acts, health conditions and epidemics, labor conditions, and possible disruptions in transportation, communications and information technology networks of the various countries in which we operate. In addition, our global operations expose us to periods when the U.S. dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the non-U.S. currencies in which we transact business. The remeasurement of non-U.S. dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We face substantial competition that requires us to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressures. We face intense technological and pricing competition in the markets in which we operate. We expect this competition will continue to increase from large competitors and from small competitors serving niche markets, and also from emerging companies, particularly in Asia, that sell products into the same markets in which we operate. For example, we may face increased competition as a result of China actively promoting and reshaping its domestic semiconductor industry through policy changes and investment. These actions, in conjunction with trade tensions, may restrict us from participating in the China market or may prevent us from competing effectively. Certain competitors possess sufficient financial, technical and management resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably against our products, and consolidation among our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively. The price and product development pressures that result from competition may lead to reduced profit margins and lost business opportunities in the event that we are unable to match the price declines or cost efficiencies, or meet the technological, product, support, software or manufacturing advancements of our competitors. 8 Changes in expected demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our customers include companies in a wide range of end markets and sectors within those markets. If demand in one or more sectors within our end markets declines or the rate of growth slows, our results of operations may be adversely affected. The cyclical nature of the semiconductor market occasionally leads to significant and rapid increases and decreases in product demand. Additionally, the loss or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of our large customers, including curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers, the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustments, changes in demand for customer products, or trade restrictions, may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our results of operations also might suffer because of a general decline in customer demand resulting from, for example: uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets; natural events, epidemics or domestic or international political, social, economic or other conditions; breaches of customer information technology systems that disrupt customer operations; or a customer’s inability to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity. Our ability to match inventory and production with the product mix needed to fill orders may affect our ability to meet a quarter’s revenue forecast. We manufacture products based on forecasts of customers’ demands. These forecasts are based on multiple assumptions, and if inaccurate, could cause us to hold inadequate, excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our operating results and our reputation could be adversely affected by breaches, disruptions or other incidents relating to our information technology systems. Breaches, disruptions or other incidents relating to our information technology systems or the systems of our customers, vendors and other third parties could be caused by factors such as computer viruses, system failures, restricted network access, unauthorized access, terrorism, employee malfeasance, or human error. These events could, among other things, compromise our information technology networks; result in corrupt or lost data or the unauthorized release of our, our customers’ or our suppliers’ confidential or proprietary information; cause a disruption to our manufacturing and other operations; result in the release of personal data; or cause us to incur costs associated with increased protection, remediation, regulatory inquiries or penalties, or claims for damages, any of which could adversely affect our operating results and our reputation. Cybersecurity or other threats to our information technology systems or the systems of our customers, vendors and other third parties are frequent and constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of defending against them. Our ability to successfully implement strategic, business and organizational changes could affect our business plans and results of operations. From time to time, we undertake strategic, business and organizational changes, including acquisitions, divestitures and restructuring actions, to support or carry out our objectives. If we do not successfully implement these changes, our business plans and operating results could be adversely affected. We may not achieve or sustain the expected growth, cost savings or other benefits of strategic, business and organizational changes, and charges associated with these actions could differ materially in amount and timing from our expectations. Our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we operate. We have manufacturing, data and design facilities and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather, geological events or epidemics that could disrupt operations. A natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption, particularly where we have principal manufacturing and design operations, as listed in the Properties section in Item 2, may adversely affect our results and financial condition. Rapid technological change in markets we serve requires us to develop new technologies and products. Rapid technological change in markets we serve could contribute to shortened product life cycles and a decline in average selling prices of our products. Our results of operations depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop, manufacture and market innovative products in a timely and cost-effective manner. We make significant investments in research and development to improve existing technology and products, develop new products to meet changing customer demands, and improve our production processes. In some cases, we might not realize a return or the expected return on our investments because they are generally made before commercial viability can be assured. Further, projects that are commercially viable may not contribute to our operating results until at least a few years after they are completed. 9 We face supply chain and manufacturing risks. We rely on third parties to supply us with goods and services in a cost-effective and timely manner. Our access to needed goods and services may be adversely affected by potential disputes with suppliers or disruptions in our suppliers’ operations as a result of, for example: quality excursions; uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets; domestic or international political, social, economic and other conditions; natural events or epidemics in the locations in which our suppliers operate; or limited or delayed access to key raw materials, natural resources and utilities. Additionally, a breach or other incident relating to our suppliers’ information technology systems could result in a release of confidential or proprietary information. If our suppliers are unable to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity, we may be unable to obtain needed supplies, collect accounts receivable or access needed technology. In particular, our manufacturing processes and critical manufacturing equipment require that certain key raw materials, natural resources and utilities be available. Limited or delayed access to and high costs of these items could adversely affect our results of operations. Our products contain materials that are subject to conflict minerals reporting requirements. Our relationships with customers and suppliers may be adversely affected if we are unable to describe our products as conflict-free. Additionally, our costs may increase if one or more of our customers demand that we change the sourcing of materials we cannot identify as conflict-free. Our inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect our results of operations. We subcontract a portion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our products, and we depend on third parties to provide advanced logic manufacturing process technology development. We do not have long-term contracts with all of these suppliers, and the number of alternate suppliers is limited. Reliance on these suppliers involves risks, including possible shortages of capacity in periods of high demand, suppliers’ inability to develop and deliver advanced logic manufacturing process technology in a timely, cost-effective, and appropriate manner, the possibility of suppliers’ imposition of increased costs on us and the unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property. Our results of operations and our reputation could be affected by warranty claims, product liability claims, product recalls or legal proceedings. Claims based on warranty, product liability, epidemic or delivery failures, or other grounds relating to our products, manufacturing, services, designs, communications or cybersecurity could lead to significant expenses as we defend the claims or pay damage awards or settlements. In the event of a claim, we would also incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected customer or end consumer. Any such claims may also cause us to write off the value of related inventory. We maintain product liability insurance, but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims. In addition, it is possible for a customer to recall a product containing a TI part, for example, with respect to products used in automotive applications or handheld electronics, which may cause us to incur costs and expenses relating to the recall. Any of these events could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and reputation. Our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if a customer or a distributor suffers a loss with respect to our inventory. We have consignment inventory programs in place for some of our largest customers and distributors. If a customer or distributor were to experience a loss with respect to TI-consigned inventory, our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected if we do not recover the full value of the lost inventory from the customer, distributor or insurer, or if our recovery is delayed. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by distributors’ promotion of competing product lines or our distributors’ financial performance. In 2020, about half of our revenue was generated from sales of our products through distributors. Our distributors carry competing product lines, and our sales could be affected if semiconductor distributors promote competing products over our products. Moreover, our results of operations could be affected if our distributors suffer financial difficulties that result in their inability to pay amounts owed to us. Disputes with current or former distributors could be disruptive or harmful to our business. 10 Our margins vary. Our profit margins vary due to a number of factors, which may include customer demand and shipment volume; our manufacturing processes; product mix; inventory levels; tariffs; freight costs; and new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting practices or standards. In addition, we operate in a highly competitive market environment that might adversely affect pricing for our products. Because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating costs is fixed. In general, these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or factory loadings, and can adversely affect profit margins as a result. Our continued success depends in part on our ability to retain and recruit a sufficient number of qualified employees in a competitive environment. Our continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel, as well as the effective management of succession for key employees. Skilled and experienced personnel in our industry, including engineering, management, marketing, technical and staff personnel, are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key engineering, management and technical personnel that we require to execute our business strategy. Our ability to recruit internationally or deploy employees to various locations may be limited by immigration laws. Legal and regulatory risks Our operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject. We are subject to complex laws, rules and regulations affecting our domestic and international operations relating to, for example, the environment and climate change, safety and health; trade; bribery and corruption; financial reporting; tax; data privacy and protection; labor and employment; competition; market access; epidemics; intellectual property ownership and infringement; and the movement of currency. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive and could restrict our ability to manufacture or ship our products and operate our business. If we do not comply or if we become subject to enforcement activity, we could be subject to fines, penalties or other legal liability. Furthermore, should these laws, rules and regulations be amended or expanded, or new ones enacted, we could incur materially greater compliance costs or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business. Some of these complex laws, rules and regulations – for example, those related to environmental, safety and health requirements – may particularly affect us in the jurisdictions in which we manufacture products, especially if such laws and regulations: require the use of abatement equipment beyond what we currently employ; require the addition or elimination of a raw material or process to or from our current manufacturing processes; or impose costs, fees or reporting requirements on the direct or indirect use of energy, natural resources, or materials or gases used or emitted into the environment in connection with the manufacture of our products. A substitute for a prohibited raw material or process might not be available, or might not be available at reasonable cost. Our results of operations could be affected by changes in tax-related matters. We have facilities in more than 30 countries and as a result are subject to taxation and audit by a number of taxing authorities. Tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate. If our tax rate increases, our results of operations could be adversely affected. A number of factors could cause our tax rate to increase, including a change in the jurisdictions in which our profits are earned and taxed; a change in the mix of profits from those jurisdictions; changes in available tax credits or deductions, including for amounts relating to stock compensation; changes in applicable tax rates; changes in tariff regulations or surcharges; changes in accounting principles; or adverse resolution of audits by taxing authorities. We have deferred tax assets on our balance sheet. Changes in applicable tax laws and regulations or in our business performance could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax assets, which could also affect our results of operations. In addition, we are subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction. These laws and regulations can be complex and subject to interpretation. Changes in these laws and regulations, including those that align with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting recommendations, could affect the locations where we are deemed to earn income, which could in turn affect our results of operations. Each quarter we forecast our tax expense based on our forecast of our performance for the year. If that performance forecast changes, our forecasted tax expense will change. 11 Our performance depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights and to maintain freedom of operation. Access to worldwide markets depends in part on the continued strength of our intellectual property portfolio in all jurisdictions where we conduct business. There can be no assurance that, as our business evolves, we will obtain the necessary intellectual property rights, or that we will be able to independently develop the technology, software or know-how necessary to conduct our business or that we can do so without infringing the intellectual property rights of others. To the extent that we have to rely on technology from others for which a license is required, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such a license at all or on terms we consider reasonable. We, directly and indirectly, face infringement claims from third parties, including non-practicing entities that have acquired patents to pursue enforcement actions against other companies. We also face infringement claims where we or our customers make, use or sell products and where the intellectual property laws may be less established or less predictable. These assertions, whether or not of any merit, expose us to claims for damages and/or injunctions from third parties, as well as claims for indemnification by our customers in instances where we have a contractual or other legal obligation to indemnify them against damages resulting from infringement claims. We actively enforce and protect our own intellectual property rights. However, our efforts cannot prevent all misappropriation or improper use of our protected technology and information, including, for example, third parties’ use of our patented or copyrighted technology, or our trade secrets in their products without the right to do so, or third parties’ sale of counterfeit products bearing our trademark. The risk of unfair copying or cloning may impede our ability to sell our products. The laws of countries where we operate may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as U.S. laws. Increases in health care and pension benefit costs could affect our results of operations and financial condition. Federal and state health care reform programs could increase our costs with regard to medical coverage of our employees, which could reduce profitability and affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, obligations related to our pension and other postretirement plans reflect assumptions that affect the planned funding and costs of these plans, including the actual return on plan assets, discount rates, plan participant population demographics and changes in pension regulations. Changes in these assumptions may affect plan funding, cash flow and results of operations, and our costs and funding obligations could increase significantly if our plans’ actual experience differs from these assumptions. Risks related to our financing activities and other risks Our debt could affect our operations and financial condition. From time to time, we issue debt securities with various interest rates and maturities. While we believe we will have the ability to service this debt, our ability to make principal and interest payments when due depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles, and business and other factors affecting our operations, including our other risk factors, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, our obligation to make principal and interest payments could divert funds that otherwise might be invested in our operations or returned to shareholders, or could cause us to raise funds by, for example, issuing new debt or equity or selling assets. Our results of operations and liquidity could be affected by changes in the financial markets. We maintain bank accounts, one or more multiyear revolving credit agreements, and a portfolio of investments to support the financing needs of the company. Our ability to fund our operations, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, service our debt obligations and meet our cash return objectives depends upon continuous access to our bank and investment accounts, and may depend on access to our bank credit lines that support commercial paper borrowings and provide additional liquidity through short-term bank loans. If we are unable to access these accounts and credit lines (for example, due to instability in the financial markets), our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected and our ability to access the capital markets or redeem our investments could be restricted. Material impairments of our goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our results of operations. We have a significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet. Charges associated with impairments of goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. ITEM 1B.

Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Overview We design, make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. Technology is the foundation of our company, but ultimately, our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate long-term value for owners is the growth of free cash flow per share. Our strategy to maximize free cash flow per share growth has three elements: 1. A great business model that is focused on analog and embedded processing products and built around four sustainable competitive advantages. The four sustainable competitive advantages are powerful in combination and provide tangible benefits: i. A strong foundation of manufacturing and technology that provides lower costs and greater control of our supply chain. ii. A broad portfolio of analog and embedded processing products that offers more opportunity per customer and more value for our investments. iii. The reach of our market channels that gives access to more customers and more of their design projects, leading to the opportunity to sell more of our products into each design and gives us better insight and knowledge of customer needs. iv. Diversity and longevity of our products, markets and customer positions that provide less single point dependency and longer returns on our investments. Together, these competitive advantages help position TI in a unique class of companies capable of generating and returning significant amounts of cash for our owners. We make our investments with an eye towards long-term strengthening and leveraging of these advantages. 2. Discipline in allocating capital to the best opportunities. This spans how we select R&D projects, develop new capabilities like TI.com, invest in new manufacturing capacity or how we think about acquisitions and returning cash to our owners. 3. Efficiency, which means constantly striving for more output for every dollar spent. We believe that our business model with the combined effect of our four competitive advantages sets TI apart from our peers and will for a long time to come. We will invest to strengthen our competitive advantages, be disciplined in capital allocation and stay diligent in our pursuit of efficiencies. Finally, we will remain focused on the belief that long-term growth of free cash flow per share is the ultimate measure to generate value. Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document. In the following discussion of our results of operations: • Our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels, and how management allocates resources and measures results. During 2020, we reorganized the product lines within our Analog segment to simplify our business structure into our Power and Signal Chain product lines. These changes had no impact on our previously reported consolidated financial statements or on our reportable segment results. See Note 1 to the financial statements for more information regarding our segments. • When we discuss our results: ◦ Unless otherwise noted, changes in our revenue are attributable to changes in customer demand, which are evidenced by fluctuations in shipment volumes. ◦ New products do not tend to have a significant impact on our revenue in any given period because we sell such a large number of products. ◦ From time to time, our revenue and gross profit are affected by changes in demand for higher-priced or lower-priced products, which we refer to as changes in the “mix” of products shipped. 16 ◦ Because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed. When factory loadings decrease, our fixed costs are spread over reduced output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins decrease. Conversely, as factory loadings increase, our fixed costs are spread over increased output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins increase. Increases and decreases in factory loadings tend to correspond to increases and decreases in demand. • For an explanation of free cash flow and the term “annual operating tax rate,” see the Non-GAAP financial information section. • All dollar amounts in the tables are stated in millions of U.S. dollars. Our results of operations provides details of our financial results for 2020 and 2019 and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussion of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. Impact of COVID-19 The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and its follow-on effects are impacting and will likely continue to impact business activity across industries worldwide, including TI. Therefore, we remain cautious about how the economy might behave for the next few years. The impact to our lead times and ability to fulfill orders was minimal in 2020. However, depending on pandemic-related factors like the potential of local manufacturing restrictions on our factories, we could experience constraints in fulfilling customer orders in future periods. The coronavirus pandemic remains dynamic with uncertainty around its duration and broader impact. We continue to monitor and assess the situation and address implications to our business, supply chain and customer demand. We have long had a business continuity plan in place for unforeseeable situations, like we have seen with COVID-19. Additionally, over the past several years, we have invested in building inventory and expanding our global internally owned manufacturing footprint. Investing in these capabilities has given us flexibility, such as the ability to build products across multiple manufacturing sites. These investments have helped to minimize disruptions, but may not be sufficient to eliminate them. Results of operations Our strategic focus is on analog and embedded processing products sold into six end markets: industrial, automotive, personal electronics, communications equipment, enterprise systems and other. While all end markets represent good opportunities, we place additional strategic emphasis on designing and selling those products into the industrial and automotive markets, which we believe represent the best growth opportunities. Gross margin of 64.1% reflected the quality of our product portfolio, as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, including the benefit of 300-millimeter Analog production. Our focus on analog and embedded processing allows us to generate strong cash flow from operations. Our cash flow from operations of $6.14 billion underscored the strength of our business model. Free cash flow was $5.49 billion and represented 38.0% of revenue. During 2020, consistent with our commitment to return free cash flow to owners, we returned $5.98 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. Our dividend represented 62% of free cash flow, underscoring its sustainability. Details of financial results – 2020 compared with 2019 Revenue of $14.46 billion increased $78 million, or 1%, primarily due to higher revenue from Analog, partially offset by lower revenue from Embedded Processing. Gross profit of $9.27 billion was up $105 million, or 1%, due to higher revenue and increased factory loadings. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit increased to 64.1% from 63.7%. Operating expenses (R&D and SG&A) were $3.15 billion compared with $3.19 billion. Acquisition charges were $198 million compared with $288 million and were non-cash. See Note 7 to the financial statements. 17 Restructuring charges/other was a charge of $24 million due to an Embedded Processing action, compared with a credit of $36 million due to the sale of our manufacturing facility in Greenock, Scotland in 2019. Operating profit was $5.89 billion, or 40.8% of revenue, compared with $5.72 billion, or 39.8% of revenue. Other income and expense (OI&E) was $313 million of income compared with $175 million of income, which increased primarily due to higher royalty income. See Note 12 to the financial statements. Interest and debt expense of $190 million increased $20 million due to the issuance of additional long-term debt. Our provision for income taxes was $422 million compared with $711 million. The decrease was due to higher discrete tax benefits, which included a $249 million benefit from the settlement of a depreciation-related uncertain tax position and, to a lesser extent, higher U.S. tax benefits, partially offset by higher income before income taxes. Our annual operating tax rate, which does not include discrete tax items, was 14% compared with 16% in 2019. We use “annual operating tax rate” to describe the estimated annual effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate, which includes discrete tax items, was 7% in 2020 compared with 12% in 2019. See Note 4 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to our effective tax rate. Net income was $5.60 billion compared with $5.02 billion. EPS was $5.97 compared with $5.24. Segment results – 2020 compared with 2019 Analog (includes Power and Signal Chain product lines) 2020 2019 Change Revenue $ 10,886 $ 10,223 6 % Operating profit 4,912 4,477 10 % Operating profit % of revenue 45.1 % 43.8 % Analog revenue increased in both product lines about evenly. Operating profit increased due to higher revenue and associated gross profit.

Operating profit decreased due to lower revenue and associated gross profit. Other (includes DLP ® products, calculators and custom ASIC products) 2020 2019 Change Revenue $ 1,005 $ 1,217 (17) % Operating profit * 239 339 (29) % Operating profit % of revenue 23.8 % 27.9 % * Includes acquisition charges and restructuring charges/other Other revenue decreased $212 million, and operating profit decreased $100 million. Financial condition At the end of 2020, total cash (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments) was $6.57 billion, an increase of $1.18 billion from the end of 2019. 18 Accounts receivable were $1.41 billion, an increase of $340 million compared with the end of 2019. Days sales outstanding at the end of 2020 were 31 compared with 29 at the end of 2019. Inventory was $1.96 billion, a decrease of $46 million from the end of 2019. Days of inventory at the end of 2020 were 123 compared with 144 at the end of 2019. Liquidity and capital resources Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations. Additional sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and a variable rate, revolving credit facility. Cash flows from operating activities for 2020 were $6.14 billion, a decrease of $510 million primarily due to an increase in cash used for working capital, partially offset by higher net income. Our revolving credit facility is with a consortium of investment-grade banks and allows us to borrow up to $2 billion until March 2024. This credit facility also serves as support for the issuance of commercial paper. As of December 31, 2020, our credit facility was undrawn, and we had no commercial paper outstanding. Investing activities for 2020 used $922 million compared with $1.92 billion in 2019. Capital expenditures were $649 million compared with $847 million in 2019 and were primarily for semiconductor manufacturing equipment and facilities in both periods. Short-term investments used cash of $241 million in 2020 compared with $1.14 billion in 2019. Financing activities for 2020 used $4.55 billion compared with $4.73 billion in 2019. In 2020, we received net proceeds of $1.50 billion from the issuance of fixed-rate, long-term debt and retired maturing debt of $500 million. In 2019, we received net proceeds of $1.49 billion from the issuance of fixed-rate, long-term debt and retired maturing debt of $750 million. Dividends paid in 2020 were $3.43 billion compared with $3.01 billion in 2019, reflecting an increase in the dividend rate, partially offset by fewer shares outstanding. We used $2.55 billion to repurchase 23.4 million shares of our common stock compared with $2.96 billion used in 2019 to repurchase 27.4 million shares. Employee exercises of stock options provided cash proceeds of $470 million compared with $539 million in 2019. We had $3.11 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $3.46 billion of short-term investments as of December 31, 2020. We believe we have the necessary financial resources and operating plans to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend and debt-related payments and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months. Non-GAAP financial information This MD&A includes references to free cash flow and ratios based on that measure. These are financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). Free cash flow was calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from the most directly comparable GAAP measure, cash flows from operating activities (also referred to as cash flow from operations). We believe that free cash flow and the associated ratios provide insight into our liquidity, our cash-generating capability and the amount of cash potentially available to return to shareholders, as well as insight into our financial performance. These non-GAAP measures are supplemental to the comparable GAAP measures. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in the table below. For Years Ended December 31, 2020 2019 Cash flow from operations (GAAP) $ 6,139 $ 6,649 Capital expenditures (649) (847) Free cash flow (non-GAAP) $ 5,490 $ 5,802 Revenue $ 14,461 $ 14,383 Cash flow from operations as a percentage of revenue (GAAP) 42.5 % 46.2 % Free cash flow as a percentage of revenue (non-GAAP) 38.0 % 40.3 % 19 This MD&A also includes references to an annual operating tax rate, a non-GAAP term we use to describe the estimated annual effective tax rate, a GAAP measure that by definition does not include discrete tax items. We believe the term annual operating tax rate helps differentiate from the effective tax rate, which includes discrete tax items.

(b) Includes payments for software licenses and contractual arrangements with suppliers when there is a fixed, non-cancellable payment schedule or when minimum payments are due with a reduced delivery schedule. Excludes cancellable arrangements. See Note 11 to the financial statements. (c) Includes payments for the one-time transition tax on our indefinitely reinvested earnings related to the 2017 enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. (d) Includes minimum payments for leased facilities and equipment and purchases of industrial gases under contracts accounted for as operating leases. See Note 10 to the financial statements. (e) Estimated payments for certain liabilities that existed as of December 31, 2020. (f) Excludes $89 million of uncertain tax liabilities under ASC 740, as well as any planned future funding contributions to retirement benefit plans. Amounts associated with uncertain tax liabilities have been excluded because of the difficulty in making reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities. Regarding future funding of retirement benefit plans, we plan to contribute about $10 million in 2021, but funding projections beyond 2021 are not practical to estimate due to the rules affecting tax-deductible contributions and the impact from the plans’ asset performance, interest rates and potential U.S. and non-U.S. legislation. Critical accounting policies Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements. As disclosed in Note 2, the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. However, based on facts and circumstances inherent in developing estimates and assumptions, management believes it is unlikely that applying other estimates and assumptions would have a material impact on the financial statements. We consider the following accounting policies to be those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and that require a higher degree of judgment. Income taxes In determining net income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax provisions and the resultant tax liabilities and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. 20 In the ordinary course of global business, there may be many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. The calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the interpretation and application of complex tax laws, and significant judgment is necessary to (i) determine whether, based on the technical merits, a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and (ii) measure the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. Although we believe the estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different from what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals. As part of our financial process, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered. If recovery is not likely, the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are estimated not to be ultimately recoverable. Our judgment regarding future recoverability of our deferred tax assets may change due to various factors, including changes in U.S. or international tax laws and changes in market conditions and their impact on our assessment of taxable income in future periods. These changes, if any, may require adjustments to the deferred tax assets and an accompanying reduction or increase in net income in the period when such determinations are made. Inventory valuation allowances Inventory is valued net of allowances for unsalable or obsolete raw materials, work in process and finished goods. Statistical allowances are determined quarterly for raw materials and work in process based on historical disposals of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons. For finished goods, quarterly statistical allowances are determined by comparing inventory levels of individual parts to historical shipments, current backlog and estimated future sales in order to identify inventory considered unlikely to be sold. A specific allowance for each material type will be carried if there is a significant event not captured by the statistical allowance, such as an end-of-life part or demand with imminent risk of cancellation. Allowances are also calculated quarterly for instances where inventoried costs for individual products are in excess of the net realizable value for those products. Actual future write-offs of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons may differ from estimates and calculations used to determine valuation allowances due to changes in customer demand, customer negotiations, technology shifts and other factors. Changes in accounting standards See Note 2 to the financial statements for information regarding the status of new accounting and reporting standards. Off-balance sheet arrangements As of December 31, 2020, we had no significant off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. Commitments and contingencies See Note 11 to the financial statements for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies. 21 ITEM 7A. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk Foreign exchange risk The U.S. dollar is our functional currency for financial reporting. Our non-U.S. entities own assets or liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars or other currencies. Exchange rate fluctuations impact taxable income in those jurisdictions and consequently impact our effective tax rate. Our balance sheet also reflects amounts remeasured from non-U.S. dollar currencies. Because most of the aggregate non-U.S. dollar balance sheet exposure is hedged by forward currency exchange contracts, which are based on year-end 2020 balances and currency exchange rates, a hypothetical 10% plus or minus fluctuation in non-U.S. currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar would result in a pretax currency exchange gain or loss of approximately $3 million. We use these forward currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings impact that exchange rate fluctuations may have on our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures. As of December 31, 2020, we had forward currency exchange contracts outstanding with a notional value of $416 million to hedge net balance sheet exposures (including $147 million to sell Japanese yen, $85 million to sell euros and $82 million to sell British pounds). Similar hedging activities existed at year-end 2019. Interest rate risk We have the following potential exposure to changes in interest rates: (i) the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and short-term investments, which could produce a gain or a loss; and (ii) the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our debt. As of December 31, 2020, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and short-term investments by about $9 million and decrease the fair value of our long-term debt by $650 million. Because interest rates on our long-term debt are fixed, changes in interest rates would not affect the cash flows associated with long-term debt. Equity risk Long-term investments at year-end 2020 include the following: • Investments in mutual funds – includes mutual funds that were selected to generate returns that offset changes in certain liabilities related to deferred compensation arrangements. The mutual funds hold a variety of debt and equity investments. • Investments in venture capital funds – includes investments in limited partnerships (accounted for under either the equity method or at cost as non-marketable equity securities). • Equity investments – includes non-marketable (non-publicly traded) equity securities. Investments in mutual funds are stated at fair value. Changes in prices of the mutual fund investments are expected to offset related changes in certain deferred compensation liabilities. Non-marketable equity securities and certain venture capital funds are stated at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes. Investments in the remaining venture capital funds are stated using the equity method. See Note 6 to the financial statements for details of equity and other long-term investments. We also utilize total return swaps to economically hedge exposure to changes in liabilities related to the equity market risks of certain deferred compensation arrangements with employees. Gains or losses from changes in the fair value of these total return swaps generally offset the related losses or gains on the deferred compensation liabilities. 22 ITEM 8.

Description of business, including segment and geographic area information We design, make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. We have two reportable segments, Analog and Embedded Processing, each of which represents groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels. • Analog semiconductors change real-world signals, such as sound, temperature, pressure or images, by conditioning them, amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors. Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in all electronic equipment by converting, distributing, storing, discharging, isolating and measuring electrical energy, whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or using a battery. Our Analog segment consists of two major product lines: Power and Signal Chain. • Embedded Processing products are the digital “brains” of many types of electronic equipment. They are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for various combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application. During 2020, we reorganized the product lines within our Analog segment to simplify our business structure into our Power and Signal Chain product lines. These changes had no effect on either our previously reported consolidated financial statements or our reportable segment results. We report the results of our remaining business activities in Other. Other includes operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for individually reportable segments and cannot be aggregated with other operating segments. Other includes DLP ® products, calculators and custom ASIC products. In Other, we also include items that are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments. Examples of these items include acquisition charges (see Note 7); restructuring charges (see Note 12); and certain corporate-level items, such as litigation expenses, environmental costs, insurance settlements, and gains and losses from other activities, including asset dispositions. We allocate the remainder of our expenses associated with corporate activities to our operating segments based on specific methodologies, such as percentage of operating expenses or headcount. Our centralized manufacturing and support organizations, such as facilities, procurement and logistics, provide support to our operating segments, including those in Other. Costs incurred by these organizations, including depreciation, are charged to the segments on a per-unit basis. Consequently, depreciation expense is not an independently identifiable component within the segments’ results and, therefore, is not provided. With the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segment, nor does the chief operating decision maker evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information. We have no material intersegment revenue. The accounting policies of the segments are consistent with those described in the summary of significant accounting policies and practices. 29 Segment information For Years Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Revenue: Analog $ 10,886 $ 10,223 $ 10,801 Embedded Processing 2,570 2,943 3,554 Other 1,005 1,217 1,429 Total revenue $ 14,461 $ 14,383 $ 15,784 Operating profit: Analog $ 4,912 $ 4,477 $ 5,109 Embedded Processing 743 907 1,205 Other 239 339 399 Total operating profit $ 5,894 $ 5,723 $ 6,713 Geographic area information The following geographic area information includes revenue, based on product shipment destination, and property, plant and equipment, based on physical location. The geographic revenue information does not necessarily reflect end demand by geography because our products tend to be shipped to the locations where our customers manufacture their products.

Basis of presentation and significant accounting policies and practices Basis of presentation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The basis of these financial statements is comparable for all periods presented herein. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. All dollar amounts in the financial statements and tables in these notes, except per-share amounts, are stated in millions of U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated. We have reclassified certain amounts in the prior periods’ financial statements to conform to the 2020 presentation. The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates from which final results may vary. Significant accounting policies and practices Revenue recognition We generate revenue primarily from the sale of semiconductor products, either directly to a customer or to a distributor. We have a variety of types of contracts with our customers and distributors. In determining whether a contract exists, we evaluate the terms of the arrangement, the relationship with the customer or distributor and their ability to pay. We recognize revenue from sales of our products, including sales to our distributors, when control is transferred. Control is considered transferred when title and risk of loss pass, when the customer becomes obligated to pay and, where required, when the customer has accepted the products. This transfer generally occurs at a point in time upon shipment or delivery to the customer or distributor, depending upon the terms of the sales order. Payment for sales to customers and distributors is generally due on our standard commercial terms. For sales to distributors, payment is not contingent upon resale of the products. Revenue from sales of our products that are subject to inventory consignment agreements is recognized at a point in time, when the customer or distributor pulls product from consignment inventory that we store at designated locations. Delivery and transfer of control occur at that point, when title and risk of loss transfers and the customer or distributor becomes obligated to pay for the products pulled from inventory. Until the products are pulled for use or sale by the customer or distributor, we retain control over the products’ disposition, including the right to pull back or relocate the products. The revenue recognized is adjusted based on allowances, which are prepared on a portfolio basis using a most likely amount methodology based on analysis of historical data and contractual terms. These allowances, which are not material, generally include adjustments for pricing arrangements, product returns and incentives. The length of time between invoicing and payment is not significant under any of our payment terms. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. In addition, we record an allowance for credit losses on accounts receivable that we estimate may not be collected. We monitor collectability of accounts receivable primarily through review of accounts receivable aging. When collection is at risk, we assess the impact on amounts recorded for credit losses and, if necessary, record a charge in the period such determination is made. We recognize shipping fees, if any, received from customers in revenue. We include the related shipping and handling costs in cost of revenue. The majority of our customers pay these fees directly to third parties. Advertising costs We expense advertising and other promotional costs as incurred. This expense was $ 28 million, $ 30 million and $ 34 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Income taxes We account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach. We record the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences related to events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns. We record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 31 Other assessed taxes Some transactions require us to collect taxes such as sales, value-added and excise taxes from our customers. These transactions are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Income on a net (excluded from revenue) basis. Leases We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Leases are included in other long-term assets, accrued expenses and other liabilities, and other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Lease assets represent our right to use underlying assets for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligations to make lease payments over the lease term. On the commencement date, leases are evaluated for classification, and assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. We use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement in determining the present value of lease payments. Operating lease expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Our lease values include options to extend or not to terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options. We have agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for as a single lease component. Leases with an initial lease term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; we recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Earnings per share (EPS) We use the two-class method for calculating EPS because the restricted stock units (RSUs) we grant are participating securities containing non-forfeitable rights to receive dividend equivalents. Under the two-class method, a portion of net income is allocated to RSUs and excluded from the calculation of income allocated to common stock. Computation and reconciliation of earnings per common share are as follows (shares in millions): For Years Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Net Income Shares EPS Net Income Shares EPS Net Income Shares EPS Basic EPS: Net income $ 5,595 $ 5,017 $ 5,580 Income allocated to RSUs ( 27 ) ( 32 ) ( 43 ) Income allocated to common stock $ 5,568 921 $ 6.05 $ 4,985 936 $ 5.33 $ 5,537 970 $ 5.71 Dilutive effect of stock compensation plans 12 16 20 Diluted EPS: Net income $ 5,595 $ 5,017 $ 5,580 Income allocated to RSUs ( 27 ) ( 31 ) ( 42 ) Income allocated to common stock $ 5,568 933 $ 5.97 $ 4,986 952 $ 5.24 $ 5,538 990 $ 5.59 Potentially dilutive securities representing 4 million, 6 million and 4 million shares of common stock that were outstanding in 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per common share during these periods because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. Investments We present investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as cash equivalents, short-term investments or long-term investments, which are detailed below. See Note 6 for additional information. • Cash equivalents and short-term investments – We consider investments in available-for-sale debt securities with maturities of 90 days or less from the date of our investment to be cash equivalents. We consider investments in available-for-sale debt securities with maturities beyond 90 days from the date of our investment as being available for use in current operations and include them in short-term investments. The primary objectives of our cash equivalent and short-term investment activities are to preserve capital and maintain liquidity while generating appropriate returns. 32 • Long-term investments – Long-term investments consist of mutual funds, venture capital funds and non-marketable equity securities. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. Cost is generally computed on a currently adjusted standard cost basis, which approximates cost on a first-in, first-out basis. Standard cost is based on the normal utilization of installed factory capacity. Cost associated with underutilization of capacity is expensed as incurred. Inventory held at consignment locations is included in our finished goods inventory. We review inventory quarterly for salability and obsolescence. A statistical allowance is provided for inventory considered unlikely to be sold. The statistical allowance is based on an analysis of historical disposal activity, historical customer shipments, as well as estimated future sales. A specific allowance for each material type will be carried if there is a significant event not captured by the statistical allowance. We write off inventory in the period in which disposal occurs. Property, plant and equipment; acquisition-related intangibles; and other capitalized costs Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Our cost basis includes certain assets acquired in business combinations that were initially recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the improvements. We amortize acquisition-related intangibles on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life of the assets. Capitalized software licenses generally are amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the license. Fully depreciated or amortized assets are written off against accumulated depreciation or amortization. Impairments of long-lived assets We regularly review whether facts or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying values of property, plant and equipment or other long-lived assets, including intangible assets, are impaired. We assess the recoverability of assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with those assets to their respective carrying amounts. Any impairment charge is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. Fair value is determined by available market valuations, if applicable, or by discounted cash flows. Goodwill Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if certain impairment indicators arise. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1 for our reporting units, which compares the fair value for each reporting unit to its associated carrying value, including goodwill. See Note 7 for additional information. Foreign currency The functional currency for our non-U.S. subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Accounts recorded in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are remeasured into the functional currency. Current assets (except inventories), deferred taxes, other assets, current liabilities and long-term liabilities are remeasured at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period. Property, plant and equipment with associated depreciation and inventories are valued at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expense accounts other than depreciation for each month are remeasured at the appropriate daily rate of exchange. Currency exchange gains and losses from remeasurement are credited or charged to OI&E. Derivatives and hedging We use derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to foreign exchange risk. These instruments are primarily forward foreign currency exchange contracts, which are used as economic hedges to reduce the earnings impact that exchange rate fluctuations may have on our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures. Gains and losses from changes in the fair value of these forward foreign currency exchange contracts are credited or charged to OI&E. We do not apply hedge accounting to our foreign currency derivative instruments. We are exposed to variability in compensation charges related to certain deferred compensation obligations to employees. We use total return swaps to economically hedge this exposure and offset the related compensation expense, recognizing changes in the value of the swaps and the related deferred compensation liabilities in SG&A. In connection with the issuance of long-term debt, we may use financial derivatives such as treasury-rate lock agreements that are recognized in AOCI and amortized over the life of the related debt. The results of these derivative transactions have not been material. We do not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. 33 Changes in accounting standards – adopted standards for current period We adopted the following Accounting Standards Updates (ASU) during the current period, none of which had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. ASU Description Adopted Date ASU No. 2016-13 Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments January 1, 2020 ASU No. 2018-13 Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework – Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement January 1, 2020 ASU No. 2018-15 Intangibles – Goodwill and Other – Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract January 1, 2020 3. Stock compensation We have stock options outstanding to participants under long-term incentive plans. The option price per share may not be less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of the grant. The options have a 10 -year term, generally vest ratably over four years and continue to vest after the option recipient retires. We also have RSUs outstanding to participants under long-term incentive plans. Each RSU represents the right to receive one share of TI common stock, issued on the vesting date, which is generally four years after the date of grant. RSUs continue to vest after the recipient retires. Holders of RSUs receive an annual cash payment equivalent to the dividends paid on our common stock. We have options and RSUs outstanding to non-employee directors under director compensation plans. The plans generally provide for annual grants of stock options and RSUs, a one-time grant of RSUs to each new non-employee director and the issuance of TI common stock upon the distribution of stock units credited to director deferred compensation accounts. We also have an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) under which options are offered to all eligible employees in amounts based on a percentage of the employee’s compensation, subject to a cap. Under the plan, the option price per share is 85 % of the fair market value on the exercise date. Total stock compensation expense recognized is as follows: For Years Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 COR $ 21 $ 21 $ 25 R&D 68 66 69 SG&A 135 130 138 Total $ 224 $ 217 $ 232 These amounts include expenses related to non-qualified stock options, RSUs and stock options offered under our ESPP and are net of estimated forfeitures. We recognize compensation expense for non-qualified stock options and RSUs on a straight-line basis over the minimum service period required for vesting of the award, adjusting for estimated forfeitures based on historical activity. Awards issued to employees who are retirement eligible or nearing retirement eligibility are expensed on an accelerated basis. Options issued under our ESPP are expensed over a three -month period. 34 Fair-value methods and assumptions We account for all awards granted under our various stock compensation plans at fair value. We estimate the fair values for non-qualified stock options using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: For Years Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Weighted average grant date fair value, per share $ 25.55 $ 22.08 $ 23.20 Weighted average assumptions used: Expected volatility 26 % 26 % 23 % Expected lives (in years) 6.8 7.1 7.2 Risk-free interest rates 1.53 % 2.66 % 2.57 % Expected dividend yields 2.76 % 2.95 % 2.25 % We determine expected volatility on all options granted using available implied volatility rates. We believe that market-based measures of implied volatility are currently the best available indicators of the expected volatility used in these estimates. We determine expected lives of options based on the historical option exercise experience of our optionees using a rolling 10-year average. We believe the historical experience method is the best estimate of future exercise patterns currently available. Risk-free interest rates are determined using the implied yield currently available for zero-coupon U.S. government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options. Expected dividend yields are based on the annualized approved quarterly dividend rate and the current market price of our common stock at the time of grant. No assumption for a future dividend rate change is included unless there is an approved plan to change the dividend in the near term. The fair value per share of RSUs is determined based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. Our ESPP is a discount-purchase plan and consequently the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model is not used to determine the fair value per share of these awards. The fair value per share under this plan equals the amount of the discount. Long-term incentive and director compensation plans Stock option and RSU transactions under our long-term incentive and director compensation plans are as follows: Stock Options RSUs Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price per Share Shares Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value per Share Outstanding grants, December 31, 2019 32,493,944 $ 66.57 5,897,800 $ 79.62 Granted 4,253,606 130.48 1,005,778 130.59 Stock options exercised/RSUs vested ( 8,392,354 ) 53.28 ( 2,034,933 ) 53.88 Forfeited and expired ( 359,919 ) 111.06 ( 157,021 ) 103.90 Outstanding grants, December 31, 2020 27,995,277 79.69 4,711,624 100.80 The weighted average grant date fair values per share of RSUs granted in 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $ 130.59 , $ 106.58 and $ 110.05 , respectively. In 2020, 2019 and 2018, the total grant date fair values of shares vested from RSU grants were $ 110 million, $ 125 million and $ 123 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, the number of shares remaining available for future issuance under these plans was 40,334,683 . 35 Summarized information about stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2020, is as follows: Stock Options Outstanding Options Exercisable Exercise Price Range Number Outstanding (Shares) Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Life (Years) Weighted Average Exercise Price per Share Number Exercisable (Shares) Weighted Average Exercise Price per Share $ 28.13 to 161.98 27,995,277 5.8 $ 79.69 17,221,451 $ 59.33 In 2020, 2019 and 2018, the aggregate intrinsic values (i.e., the difference in the closing market price on the date of exercise and the exercise price paid by the optionee) of options exercised were $ 681 million, $ 819 million and $ 561 million, respectively. Summarized information as of December 31, 2020, about outstanding stock options that are vested and expected to vest, as well as stock options that are currently exercisable, is as follows: Outstanding Stock Options (Fully Vested and Expected to Vest) (a) Options Exercisable Number of outstanding (shares) 27,596,705 17,221,451 Weighted average remaining contractual life (in years) 5.8 4.4 Weighted average exercise price per share $ 79.13 $ 59.33 Intrinsic value (millions of dollars) $ 2,346 $ 1,805 (a) Includes effects of expected forfeitures. Excluding the effects of expected forfeitures, the aggregate intrinsic value of stock options outstanding was $ 2.36 billion. As of December 31, 2020, total future compensation related to equity awards not yet recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Income was $ 237 million, consisting of $ 103 million related to unvested stock options and $ 134 million related to unvested RSUs. The $ 237 million is expected to be recognized as follows: $ 115 million in 2021, $ 77 million in 2022, $ 40 million in 2023 and $ 5 million in 2024. Employee stock purchase plan Options outstanding under the ESPP as of December 31, 2020, had an exercise price equal to 85 % of the fair market value of TI common stock on the date of automatic exercise. The automatic exercise occurred on January 4, 2021, resulting in an exercise price of $ 137.89 per share. Of the total outstanding options, none were exercisable as of December 31, 2020. ESPP transactions are as follows: Shares Exercise Price Outstanding grants, December 31, 2019 173,849 $ 110.14 Granted 714,680 108.74 Exercised ( 745,483 ) 103.48 Outstanding grants, December 31, 2020 143,046 137.89 The weighted average grant date fair values per share of options granted under the ESPP in 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $ 19.19 , $ 18.05 and $ 15.43 , respectively. In 2020, 2019 and 2018, the total intrinsic value of options exercised under these plans was $ 14 million, $ 13 million and $ 13 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, the number of shares remaining available for future issuance under this plan was 33,097,602 . 36 Effect on shares outstanding and treasury shares Treasury shares were acquired in connection with the board-authorized stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2020, $ 10.63 billion of stock repurchase authorizations remain, and no expiration date has been specified. Our current practice is to issue shares of common stock from treasury shares upon exercise of stock options, distribution of director deferred compensation and vesting of RSUs. The following table reflects the changes in our treasury shares: Stock Options RSUs Treasury Shares Balance, December 31, 2017 757,657,217 Repurchases 49,482,220 Shares used for: Stock options/RSUs ( 8,432,458 ) ( 2,769,994 ) Stock applied to taxes — 553,720 ESPP ( 819,878 ) — Director deferred stock units — — ( 5,181 ) Total issued ( 9,252,336 ) ( 2,216,274 ) ( 11,468,610 ) Balance, December 31, 2018 795,665,646 Repurchases 27,398,701 Shares used for: Stock options/RSUs ( 11,529,174 ) ( 2,370,762 ) Stock applied to taxes — 490,347 ESPP ( 798,806 ) — Director deferred stock units — — ( 71,571 ) Total issued ( 12,327,980 ) ( 1,880,415 ) ( 14,208,395 ) Balance, December 31, 2019 808,784,381 Repurchases 23,430,215 Shares used for: Stock options/RSUs ( 8,392,354 ) ( 2,034,933 ) Stock applied to taxes — 421,518 ESPP ( 745,483 ) — Director deferred stock units — — ( 1,557 ) Total issued ( 9,137,837 ) ( 1,613,415 ) ( 10,751,252 ) Balance, December 31, 2020 821,461,787 The effects on cash flows are as follows: For Years Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Proceeds from common stock transactions (a) $ 470 $ 539 $ 373 Tax benefit realized from stock compensation $ 195 $ 224 $ 179 Reduction to deferred tax asset ( 44 ) ( 49 ) ( 43 ) Excess tax benefit for stock compensation $ 151 $ 175 $ 136 (a) Net of taxes paid for employee shares withheld of $ 53 million, $ 52 million and $ 60 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 37 4. Income taxes Income before income taxes is comprised of the following components: For Years Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 U.S. $ 5,210 $ 4,915 $ 5,672 Non-U.S. 807 813 1,014 Total $ 6,017 $ 5,728 $ 6,686 Provision for income taxes is comprised of the following components: For Years Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Current Deferred Total Current Deferred Total Current Deferred Total U.S. federal $ 357 $ ( 122 ) $ 235 $ 483 $ 25 $ 508 $ 979 $ ( 98 ) $ 881 Non-U.S. 192 ( 15 ) 177 135 56 191 225 ( 8 ) 217 U.S. state 10 — 10 12 — 12 7 1 8 Total $ 559 $ ( 137 ) $ 422 $ 630 $ 81 $ 711 $ 1,211 $ ( 105 ) $ 1,106 Principal reconciling items from the U.S. statutory income tax rate to the effective tax rate (provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes) are as follows: For Years Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 U.S. statutory income tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 % U.S. tax benefit for foreign derived intangible income ( 6.1 ) ( 4.9 ) ( 5.3 ) Impact of changes in uncertain tax positions ( 4.0 ) ( 0.1 ) — U.S. excess tax benefit for stock compensation ( 2.5 ) ( 3.1 ) ( 2.0 ) U.S. R&D tax credit ( 1.3 ) ( 1.4 ) ( 1.3 ) U.S. Tax Act transitional non-cash expense — — 4.2 Other ( 0.1 ) 0.9 ( 0.1 ) Effective tax rate 7.0 % 12.4 % 16.5 % The earnings represented by non-cash operating assets, such as fixed assets and inventory, will continue to be permanently reinvested outside the United States. Provisions of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act), such as the one-time tax on indefinitely reinvested earnings and the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) tax for years beginning in 2018, eliminate any additional U.S. taxation resulting from repatriation of earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries to the United States. Consequently, no U.S. tax provision has been made for the future remittance of these earnings. However, withholding or distribution taxes in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions will be incurred upon repatriation of available cash to the United States. A provision has been made for deferred taxes on these undistributed earnings to the extent that repatriation of the available cash to the United States is expected to result in a tax liability. As of December 31, 2020, we have no basis differences that would result in material unrecognized deferred tax liabilities. We have made an allowable policy election to account for the effects of GILTI as a component of income tax expense in the period in which the tax is incurred. 38 The primary components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows: December 31, 2020 2019 Deferred tax assets: Deferred loss and tax credit carryforwards $ 207 $ 213 Accrued expenses 180 182 Stock compensation 106 109 Inventories and related reserves 105 109 Retirement costs for defined benefit and retiree health care 44 49 Other 3 — Total deferred tax assets, before valuation allowance 645 662 Valuation allowance ( 179 ) ( 180 ) Total deferred tax assets, after valuation allowance 466 482 Deferred tax liabilities: Property, plant and equipment ( 116 ) ( 164 ) International earnings ( 44 ) ( 62 ) Acquisition-related intangibles and fair-value adjustments ( 40 ) ( 82 ) Other ( 13 ) ( 55 ) Total deferred tax liabilities ( 213 ) ( 363 ) Net deferred tax asset $ 253 $ 119 The deferred tax assets and liabilities based on tax jurisdictions are presented on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows: December 31, 2020 2019 Deferred tax assets $ 343 $ 197 Deferred tax liabilities ( 90 ) ( 78 ) Net deferred tax asset $ 253 $ 119 We make an ongoing assessment regarding the realization of U.S. and non-U.S. deferred tax assets. This assessment is based on our evaluation of relevant criteria, including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets, taxable income in prior carryback years and expectations for future taxable income. Valuation allowances decreased $ 1 million in 2020 and increased $ 8 million and $ 7 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. These changes had no impact to net income in 2020, 2019 or 2018. We have no tax loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2020. Cash payments made for income taxes, net of refunds, were $ 720 million, $ 570 million and $ 705 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Uncertain tax positions We operate in a number of tax jurisdictions, and our income tax returns are subject to examination by tax authorities in those jurisdictions who may challenge any item on these tax returns. Because the matters challenged by authorities are typically complex, their ultimate outcome is uncertain. Before any benefit can be recorded in our financial statements, we must determine that it is “more likely than not” that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate tax authorities. We recognize accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions and penalties as components of OI&E. 39 The changes in the total amounts of uncertain tax positions are as follows: 2020 2019 2018 Balance, January 1 $ 303 $ 286 $ 300 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 3 3 3 Additions for tax positions of prior years 35 63 1 Reductions for tax positions of prior years ( 249 ) ( 41 ) — Settlements with tax authorities — ( 8 ) ( 18 ) Expiration of the statute of limitations for assessing taxes ( 3 ) — — Balance, December 31 $ 89 $ 303 $ 286 Interest income (expense) recognized in the year ended December 31 $ 39 $ 9 $ ( 15 ) Interest payable as of December 31 $ 8 $ 44 $ 49 The liability for uncertain tax positions is a component of other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. All of the $ 89 million and $ 303 million liabilities for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, are comprised of positions that, if recognized, would lower the effective tax rate. If these liabilities are ultimately realized, $ 2 million of existing deferred tax assets in both 2020 and 2019 would also be realized. Reductions for tax positions of prior years in 2020 include a $ 249 million tax benefit for the effective settlement of a depreciation-related uncertain tax position. Accrued interest of $ 46 million related to this uncertain tax position was reversed and included in OI&E. As of December 31, 2020, the statute of limitations remains open for U.S. federal tax returns for 2013 and following years. Audit activities related to our U.S. federal tax returns through 2015 have been completed except for certain pending tax treaty procedures for relief from double taxation and an Internal Revenue Service appeals process related to the 2013 through 2015 audit. The procedures for relief from double taxation pertain to U.S. federal tax returns for the years 2007 through 2012. In non-U.S. jurisdictions, the years open to audit represent the years still open under the statute of limitations. With respect to major jurisdictions outside the United States, our subsidiaries are no longer subject to income tax audits for years before 2007. 5. Financial instruments and risk concentration Financial instruments We hold derivative financial instruments such as forward foreign currency exchange contracts, the fair value of which was not material as of December 31, 2020. Our forward foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2020, had a notional value of $ 416 million to hedge our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures, including $ 147 million to sell Japanese yen, $ 85 million to sell euros and $ 82 million to sell British pounds. Our investments in cash equivalents, short-term investments and certain long-term investments, as well as our deferred compensation liabilities, are carried at fair value. Our postretirement plan assets are carried at fair value or net asset value per share. The carrying values for other current financial assets and liabilities, such as accounts receivable and accounts payable, approximate fair value due to the short maturity of such instruments. As of December 31, 2020, the carrying value of long-term debt, including the current portion, was $ 6.80 billion, and the estimated fair value was $ 7.78 billion. The estimated fair value is measured using broker-dealer quotes, which are Level 2 inputs. See Note 6 for a description of fair value and the definition of Level 2 inputs. Risk concentration We are subject to counterparty risks from financial institutions, customers and issuers of debt securities. Financial instruments that could subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash deposits, cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable. To manage our credit risk exposure, we place cash investments in investment-grade debt securities and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. We also limit counterparties on cash deposits and financial derivative contracts to financial institutions with investment-grade ratings. 40 Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across different industries and geographic areas. We maintain allowances for expected returns, disputes, adjustments, incentives and credit losses. These allowances are deducted from accounts receivable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accounts receivable allowances changed to reflect amounts charged (credited) to operating results by $ 3 million, ($ 11 ) million and $ 11 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Major customer One of our end customers accounted for 10 %, 8 % and 8 % of revenue in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, recognized primarily in our Analog segment. No end customer accounted for 10% or more of revenue in 2019 or 2018 . 6. Valuation of debt and equity investments and certain liabilities Investments measured at fair value Available-for-sale debt investments, money market funds and mutual funds are stated at fair value, which is generally based on market prices or broker quotes. See Fair-value considerations . Unrealized gains and losses from available-for-sale debt securities are recorded as an increase or decrease, net of taxes, in AOCI on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and any credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities are recorded as an allowance for credit losses with an offset recognized in OI&E in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Our mutual funds hold a variety of debt and equity investments intended to generate returns that offset changes in certain deferred compensation liabilities. We record changes in the fair value of these mutual funds and the related deferred compensation liabilities in SG&A. Other investments Our other investments include equity-method investments and non-marketable equity investments, which are not measured at fair value. These investments consist of interests in venture capital funds and other non-marketable equity securities. Gains and losses from equity-method investments are recognized in OI&E based on our ownership share of the investee’s financial results. Non-marketable equity securities are measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments. Gains and losses on non-marketable equity investments are recognized in OI&E. Details of our investments are as follows: December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Cash and Cash Equivalents Short-Term Investments Long-Term Investments Cash and Cash Equivalents Short-Term Investments Long-Term Investments Measured at fair value: Money market funds $ 886 $ — $ — $ 1,213 $ — $ — Corporate obligations 256 407 — 174 1,216 — U.S. government agency and Treasury securities 1,340 3,054 — 604 1,734 — Mutual funds — — 18 — — 272 Total 2,482 3,461 18 1,991 2,950 272 Other measurement basis: Equity-method investments — — 27 — — 24 Non-marketable equity investments — — 4 — — 4 Cash on hand 625 — — 446 — — Total $ 3,107 $ 3,461 $ 49 $ 2,437 $ 2,950 $ 300 41 As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, unrealized gains and losses associated with our available-for-sale investments were not material. We did no t recognize any credit losses related to available-for-sale investments in 2020, 2019 or 2018. All of our debt securities classified as available for sale as of December 31, 2020, have maturities within one year. In 2020, 2019 and 2018, the proceeds from sales, redemptions and maturities of short-term available-for-sale investments were $ 5.29 billion, $ 2.31 billion and $ 6.71 billion, respectively. Gross realized gains and losses from these sales were not material. In 2020, we entered into total return swaps to economically hedge the variability of certain deferred compensation obligations to employees. As a result, we received proceeds of $ 253 million from the sale of investments in mutual funds that were previously being utilized to offset this exposure. Fair-value considerations We measure and report certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The three-level hierarchy described below indicates the extent and level of judgment used to estimate fair-value measurements. • Level 1 – Uses unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. • Level 2 – Uses inputs other than Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date through correlation with market data, including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and quoted prices in markets that are not active. Level 2 also includes assets and liabilities that are valued using models or other pricing methodologies that do not require significant judgment since the input assumptions used in the models, such as interest rates and volatility factors, are corroborated by readily observable data. We utilize a third-party data service to provide Level 2 valuations. We verify these valuations for reasonableness relative to unadjusted quotes obtained from brokers or dealers based on observable prices for similar assets in active markets. • Level 3 – Uses inputs that are unobservable, supported by little or no market activity and reflect the use of significant management judgment. These values are generally determined using pricing models that utilize management estimates of market participant assumptions. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had no Level 3 assets or liabilities. The following are our assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis. These tables do not include cash on hand, assets held by our postretirement plans, or assets and liabilities that are measured at historical cost or any basis other than fair value. December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Level 1 Level 2 Total Level 1 Level 2 Total Assets: Money market funds $ 886 $ — $ 886 $ 1,213 $ — $ 1,213 Corporate obligations — 663 663 — 1,390 1,390 U.S. government agency and Treasury securities 4,394 — 4,394 2,338 — 2,338 Mutual funds 18 — 18 272 — 272 Total assets $ 5,298 $ 663 $ 5,961 $ 3,823 $ 1,390 $ 5,213 Liabilities: Deferred compensation $ 350 $ — $ 350 $ 298 $ — $ 298 Total liabilities $ 350 $ — $ 350 $ 298 $ — $ 298 42 7. Goodwill and acquisition-related intangibles Goodwill by segment as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, is as follows: Goodwill Analog $ 4,158 Embedded Processing 172 Other 32 Total $ 4,362 We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1 and determine whether the fair value of each of our reporting units is in excess of its carrying value. Determination of fair value is based upon management estimates and judgment, using unobservable inputs in discounted cash flow models to calculate the fair value of each reporting unit. These unobservable inputs are considered Level 3 measurements, as described in Note 6. In 2020, 2019 and 2018, we determined no impairment was indicated. The components of acquisition-related intangibles are as follows: December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Amortization Period (Years) Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Developed technology 8 – 10 $ 1,895 $ 1,753 $ 142 $ 2,000 $ 1,660 $ 340 Other intangibles 5 10 — 10 — — — Total $ 1,905 $ 1,753 $ 152 $ 2,000 $ 1,660 $ 340 Acquisition charges Acquisition charges represent the ongoing amortization of intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of National Semiconductor Corporation. These amounts are included in Other for segment reporting purposes, consistent with how management measures the performance of its segments. Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles was $ 198 million, $ 288 million and $ 318 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Fully amortized assets are written off against accumulated amortization. The remaining estimated amortization is $ 144 million in 2021. 8. Postretirement benefit plans Plan descriptions We have various employee retirement plans, including defined contribution, defined benefit and retiree health care benefit plans. For qualifying employees, we offer deferred compensation arrangements. U.S. retirement plans Our principal retirement plans in the United States are a defined contribution plan, an enhanced defined contribution plan and qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans. The defined benefit plans were closed to new participants in 1997, and then current participants were allowed to make a one-time election to continue accruing a benefit in the plans or to cease accruing a benefit and instead to participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan. Both defined contribution plans offer an employer-matching savings option that allows employees to make pretax and post-tax contributions to various investment choices. Employees who elected to continue accruing a benefit in the qualified defined benefit pension plans may also participate in the defined contribution plan, where employer-matching contributions are provided for up to 2 % of the employee’s annual eligible earnings. Employees who elected not to continue accruing a benefit in the defined benefit pension plans and employees hired after November 1997 and through December 31, 2003, may participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan. This plan provides for a fixed employer contribution of 2 % of the employee’s annual eligible earnings, plus an employer-matching contribution of up to 4 % of the employee’s annual eligible earnings. Employees hired after December 31, 2003, do not receive the fixed employer contribution of 2 % of the employee’s annual eligible earnings. 43 As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, as a result of employees’ elections, TI’s U.S. defined contribution plans held shares of TI common stock totaling 7 million shares and 8 million shares valued at $ 1.12 billion and $ 988 million, respectively. Dividends paid on these shares in 2020 and 2019 were $ 27 million and $ 26 million, respectively. Effective April 1, 2016, the TI common stock fund was frozen to new contributions or transfers into the fund. Our aggregate expense for the U.S. defined contribution plans was $ 61 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018. The defined benefit pension plans include employees still accruing benefits, as well as employees and participants who no longer accrue service-related benefits, but instead, may participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan. Benefits under the qualified defined benefit pension plan are determined using a formula based on years of service and the highest five consecutive years of compensation. We intend to contribute amounts to this plan to meet the minimum funding requirements of applicable local laws and regulations, plus such additional amounts as we deem appropriate. The non-qualified defined benefit plans are unfunded and closed to new participants. U.S. retiree health care benefit plan U.S. employees who meet eligibility requirements are offered medical coverage during retirement. We make a contribution toward the cost of those retiree medical benefits for certain retirees and their dependents. The contribution rates are based upon various factors, the most important of which are an employee’s date of hire, date of retirement, years of service and eligibility for Medicare benefits. The balance of the cost is borne by the plan’s participants. Employees hired after January 1, 2001, are responsible for the full cost of their medical benefits during retirement. Non-U.S. retirement plans We provide retirement coverage for non-U.S. employees, as required by local laws or to the extent we deem appropriate, through a number of defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Retirement benefits are generally based on an employee’s years of service and compensation. Funding requirements are determined on an individual country and plan basis and are subject to local country practices and market circumstances. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, as a result of employees’ elections, TI’s non-U.S. defined contribution plans held TI common stock valued at $ 36 million and $ 28 million, respectively. Dividends paid on these shares of TI common stock in 2020 and 2019 were not material. Effects on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Balance Sheets Expenses related to defined benefit and retiree health care benefit plans are as follows: U.S. Defined Benefit U.S. Retiree Health Care Non-U.S. Defined Benefit 2020 2019 2018 2020 2019 2018 2020 2019 2018 Service cost $ 18 $ 18 $ 19 $ 3 $ 3 $ 5 $ 34 $ 31 $ 36 Interest cost 31 38 35 13 14 15 38 43 45 Expected return on plan assets ( 36 ) ( 41 ) ( 42 ) ( 12 ) ( 14 ) ( 15 ) ( 78 ) ( 86 ) ( 67 ) Amortization of prior service cost (credit) — — — ( 2 ) ( 1 ) ( 3 ) 1 1 ( 1 ) Recognized net actuarial loss 7 9 17 — — 2 14 29 20 Net periodic benefit costs 20 24 29 2 2 4 9 18 33 Settlement losses 16 10 23 — — — 1 3 3 Total, including other postretirement losses $ 36 $ 34 $ 52 $ 2 $ 2 $ 4 $ 10 $ 21 $ 36 All defined benefit and retiree health care benefit plan expense components other than service cost are recognized in OI&E in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Service cost is recognized within operating profit. For the U.S. qualified pension and retiree health care plans, the expected return on plan assets component of net periodic benefit cost is based upon a market-related value of assets. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the market-related value of assets is the fair value adjusted by a smoothing technique whereby certain gains and losses are phased in over a period of three years . 44 Changes in the benefit obligations and plan assets for defined benefit and retiree health care benefit plans are as follows: U.S. Defined Benefit U.S. Retiree Health Care Non-U.S. Defined Benefit 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 Change in plan benefit obligation Benefit obligation at beginning of year: $ 960 $ 874 $ 359 $ 361 $ 2,581 $ 2,411 Service cost 18 18 3 3 34 31 Interest cost 31 38 13 14 38 43 Participant contributions — — 13 13 7 7 Benefits paid ( 12 ) ( 11 ) ( 39 ) ( 41 ) ( 95 ) ( 103 ) Settlements ( 94 ) ( 66 ) — — ( 8 ) ( 12 ) Curtailments — — — — — ( 1 ) Actuarial loss (gain) 194 107 40 9 143 193 Plan amendments — — — — 1 — Effects of exchange rate changes — — — — 167 12 Benefit obligation at end of year $ 1,097 $ 960 $ 389 $ 359 $ 2,868 $ 2,581 Change in plan assets Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year: $ 987 $ 869 $ 356 $ 330 $ 2,661 $ 2,410 Actual return on plan assets 164 185 58 53 260 337 Employer contributions (qualified plans) — — 1 1 11 9 Employer contributions (non-qualified plans) 16 10 — — — — Participant contributions — — 13 13 7 7 Benefits paid ( 12 ) ( 11 ) ( 39 ) ( 41 ) ( 95 ) ( 103 ) Settlements ( 94 ) ( 66 ) — — ( 8 ) ( 12 ) Effects of exchange rate changes — — — — 172 13 Fair value of plan assets at end of year $ 1,061 $ 987 $ 389 $ 356 $ 3,008 $ 2,661 Funded status at end of year $ ( 36 ) $ 27 $ — $ ( 3 ) $ 140 $ 80 The actuarial loss (gain) for all pension plans was primarily related to a change in the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations of those plans in 2020 and 2019. Amounts recognized on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, are as follows: U.S. Defined Benefit U.S. Retiree Health Care Non-U.S. Defined Benefit Total 2020 Overfunded retirement plans $ 9 $ 3 $ 234 $ 246 Accrued expenses and other liabilities & other long-term liabilities ( 6 ) — ( 5 ) ( 11 ) Underfunded retirement plans ( 39 ) ( 3 ) ( 89 ) ( 131 ) Funded status at end of 2020 $ ( 36 ) $ — $ 140 $ 104 2019 Overfunded retirement plans $ 73 $ — $ 145 $ 218 Accrued expenses and other liabilities & other long-term liabilities ( 17 ) — ( 4 ) ( 21 ) Underfunded retirement plans ( 29 ) ( 3 ) ( 61 ) ( 93 ) Funded status at end of 2019 $ 27 $ ( 3 ) $ 80 $ 104 Contributions to the plans meet or exceed all minimum funding requirements. We expect to contribute about $ 10 million to our retirement benefit plans in 2021. 45 Accumulated benefit obligations, which are generally less than the projected benefit obligations as they exclude the impact of future salary increases, were $ 992 million and $ 878 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, for the U.S. defined benefit plans, and $ 2.72 billion and $ 2.46 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, for the non-U.S. defined benefit plans.

The tables below set forth the fair value of our plan assets using the same three-level hierarchy of fair-value inputs described in Note 6. December 31, 2020 Level 1 Level 2 Other (a) Total Assets of U.S. defined benefit plan: Fixed income securities and cash equivalents $ — $ — $ 743 $ 743 Equity securities — — 318 318 Total $ — $ — $ 1,061 $ 1,061 Assets of U.S. retiree health care plan: Fixed income securities and cash equivalents $ 29 $ — $ 222 $ 251 Equity securities — — 138 138 Total $ 29 $ — $ 360 $ 389 Assets of non-U.S. defined benefit plans: Fixed income securities and cash equivalents $ 69 $ 146 $ 2,063 $ 2,278 Equity securities 43 2 685 730 Total $ 112 $ 148 $ 2,748 $ 3,008 (a) Consists of bond index and equity index funds, measured at net asset value per share, as well as cash equivalents. 46 December 31, 2019 Level 1 Level 2 Other (a) Total Assets of U.S. defined benefit plan: Fixed income securities and cash equivalents $ — $ — $ 640 $ 640 Equity securities — — 347 347 Total $ — $ — $ 987 $ 987 Assets of U.S. retiree health care plan: Fixed income securities and cash equivalents $ 62 $ — $ 168 $ 230 Equity securities — — 126 126 Total $ 62 $ — $ 294 $ 356 Assets of non-U.S. defined benefit plans: Fixed income securities and cash equivalents $ 59 $ 126 $ 1,762 $ 1,947 Equity securities 41 2 671 714 Total $ 100 $ 128 $ 2,433 $ 2,661 (a) Consists of bond index and equity index funds, measured at net asset value per share, as well as cash equivalents. The investments in our major benefit plans largely consist of low-cost, broad-market index funds to mitigate risks of concentration within market sectors. Our investment policy is designed to better match the interest rate sensitivity of the plan assets and liabilities. The appropriate mix of equity and bond investments is determined primarily through the use of detailed asset-liability modeling studies that look to balance the impact of changes in the discount rate against the need to provide asset growth to cover future service cost. Most of our plans around the world have a greater proportion of fixed income securities with return characteristics that are more closely aligned with changes in the liabilities caused by discount rate volatility. Assumptions and investment policies U.S. Defined Benefit U.S. Retiree Health Care Non-U.S. Defined Benefit 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 Weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations: Discount rate 2.81 % 3.62 % 2.74 % 3.63 % 1.31 % 1.46 % Long-term pay progression 3.70 % 3.30 % n/a n/a 3.15 % 3.06 % Weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost: Discount rate 3.42 % 4.35 % 3.63 % 4.30 % 1.46 % 1.85 % Long-term rate of return on plan assets 4.00 % 4.90 % 3.50 % 4.40 % 2.93 % 3.62 % Long-term pay progression 3.30 % 3.30 % n/a n/a 3.06 % 3.03 % We utilize a variety of methods to select an appropriate discount rate depending on the depth of the corporate bond market in the country in which the benefit plan operates. In the United States, we use a settlement approach whereby a portfolio of bonds is selected from the universe of actively traded high-quality U.S. corporate bonds. The selected portfolio is designed to provide cash flows sufficient to pay the plan’s expected benefit payments when due. The resulting discount rate reflects the rate of return of the selected portfolio of bonds. For our non-U.S. locations with a sufficient number of actively traded high-quality bonds, an analysis is performed in which the projected cash flows from the defined benefit plans are discounted against a yield curve constructed with an appropriate universe of high-quality corporate bonds available in each country. In this manner, a present value is developed. The discount rate selected is the single equivalent rate that produces the same present value. For countries that lack a sufficient corporate bond market, a government bond index is used to establish the discount rate. 47 Assumptions for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets are based on future expectations for returns for each asset class and the effect of periodic target asset allocation rebalancing. We adjust the results for the payment of reasonable expenses of the plan from plan assets. We believe our assumptions are appropriate based on the investment mix and long-term nature of the plans’ investments. Assumptions used for the non-U.S. defined benefit plans reflect the different economic environments within the various countries. The target allocation ranges for the plans that hold a substantial majority of the defined benefit assets are as follows: U.S. Defined Benefit U.S. Retiree Health Care Non-U.S. Defined Benefit Fixed income securities and cash equivalents 65 % – 80 % 65 % – 80 % 60 % – 100 % Equity securities 20 % – 35 % 20 % – 35 % 0 % – 40 % We rebalance the plans’ investments when they are outside the target allocation ranges. Weighted average asset allocations as of December 31 are as follows: U.S. Defined Benefit U.S. Retiree Health Care Non-U.S. Defined Benefit 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 Fixed income securities and cash equivalents 70 % 65 % 65 % 65 % 76 % 73 % Equity securities 30 % 35 % 35 % 35 % 24 % 27 % None of the plan assets related to the defined benefit pension plans and retiree health care benefit plan are directly invested in TI common stock. The following assumed future benefit payments to plan participants in the next 10 years are used to measure our benefit obligations. Almost all of the payments, which may vary significantly from these assumptions, will be made from plan assets and not from company assets. 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 – 2030 U.S. Defined Benefit $ 95 $ 137 $ 102 $ 100 $ 102 $ 490 U.S. Retiree Health Care 29 28 27 26 25 113 Non-U.S. Defined Benefit 99 102 102 105 106 558 Assumed health care cost trend rates for the U.S. retiree health care benefit plan as of December 31 are as follows: 2020 2019 Assumed health care cost trend rate for next year 6.75 % 7.00 % Ultimate trend rate 5.00 % 5.00 % Year in which ultimate trend rate is reached 2028 2028 Deferred compensation plans We have deferred compensation plans that allow U.S. employees whose base salary and management responsibility exceed a certain level to defer receipt of a portion of their cash compensation. Payments under these plans are made based on the participant’s distribution election and plan balance. Participants can earn a return on their deferred compensation based on notional investments in the same investment funds that are offered in our defined contribution plans. As of December 31, 2020, our liability to participants of the deferred compensation plans was $ 350 million and is recorded in other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. This amount reflects the accumulated participant deferrals and earnings thereon as of that date. We utilize total return swaps and investments in mutual funds that serve as economic hedges of our exposure to changes in the fair value of these liabilities. We record changes in the fair value of the liability and the related total return swaps and mutual funds in SG&A, as discussed in Note 6. As of December 31, 2020, we held $ 18 million in mutual funds related to these plans that are recorded in long-term investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 48 9. Debt and lines of credit Short-term borrowings We maintain a line of credit to support commercial paper borrowings, if any, and to provide additional liquidity through bank loans. As of December 31, 2020, we had a variable-rate revolving credit facility from a consortium of investment-grade banks that allows us to borrow up to $ 2 billion until March 2024. The interest rate on borrowings under this credit facility, if drawn, is indexed to the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). As of December 31, 2020, our credit facility was undrawn, and we had no commercial paper outstanding. Long-term debt In March 2020, we issued a principal amount of $ 750 million of fixed-rate, long-term debt due in 2025. We incurred $ 4 million of issuance costs. The proceeds of the offering were $ 749 million, net of the original issuance discount, and were used for general corporate purposes and the repayment of maturing debt. In April 2020, we retired $ 500 million of maturing debt. In May 2020, we issued a principal amount of $ 750 million of fixed-rate, long-term debt due in 2030. We incurred $ 5 million of issuance costs. The proceeds of the offering were $ 749 million, net of the original issuance discount, and were used for general corporate purposes. In March 2019, we issued a principal amount of $ 750 million of fixed-rate, long-term debt due in 2039. We incurred $ 7 million of issuance costs. The proceeds of the offering were $ 743 million, net of the original issuance discount, and were used for general corporate purposes. In August 2019, we retired $ 750 million of maturing debt. In September 2019, we issued a principal amount of $ 750 million of fixed-rate, long-term debt due in 2029. We incurred $ 5 million of issuance costs. The proceeds of the offering were $ 748 million, net of the original issuance discount, and were used for general corporate purposes. In May 2018, we retired $ 500 million of maturing debt. In the second quarter of 2018, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $ 1.5 billion of fixed-rate, long-term debt due in 2048, comprised of the issuance of $ 1.3 billion in May 2018 and an additional $ 200 million in June 2018. We incurred $ 16 million of issuance and other related costs. The proceeds of the offering were $ 1.5 billion, net of the original issuance discount and premium, and were used for general corporate purposes. 49 Long-term debt outstanding is as follows: December 31, 2020 2019 Notes due 2020 at 1.75 % $ — $ 500 Notes due 2021 at 2.75 % 550 550 Notes due 2022 at 1.85 % 500 500 Notes due 2023 at 2.25 % 500 500 Notes due 2024 at 2.625 % 300 300 Notes due 2025 at 1.375 % 750 — Notes due 2027 at 2.90 % 500 500 Notes due 2029 at 2.25 % 750 750 Notes due 2030 at 1.75 % 750 — Notes due 2039 at 3.875 % 750 750 Notes due 2048 at 4.15 % 1,500 1,500 Total debt 6,850 5,850 Net unamortized discounts, premiums and issuance costs ( 52 ) ( 47 ) Total debt, including net unamortized discounts, premiums and issuance costs 6,798 5,803 Current portion of long-term debt ( 550 ) ( 500 ) Long-term debt $ 6,248 $ 5,303 Interest and debt expense was $ 190 million, $ 170 million and $ 125 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. This was net of the amortized discounts, premiums and issuance costs. Cash payments for interest on long-term debt were $ 182 million, $ 156 million and $ 114 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Capitalized interest was not material. 10. Leases We conduct certain operations in leased facilities and also lease a portion of our data processing and other equipment. In addition, certain long-term supply agreements to purchase industrial gases are accounted for as operating leases. Lease agreements frequently include renewal provisions and require us to pay real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs. Our leases are included as a component of the following balance sheet lines: December 31, 2020 2019 Other long-term assets $ 319 $ 337 Accrued expenses and other liabilities $ 72 $ 73 Other long-term liabilities 249 259 50 Details of our operating leases are as follows: For Years Ended December 31, 2020 2019 Lease cost related to lease liabilities $ 70 $ 66 Variable lease cost 36 41 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities: Operating cash flows for lease cost $ 59 $ 60 Lease assets obtained in exchange for new lease liabilities $ 59 $ 167 Weighted average remaining lease term 8.9 years 8.2 years Weighted average discount rate 3.02 % 3.37 % As of December 31, 2020, we had committed to make the following minimum payments under our non-cancellable operating leases: 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 Thereafter Total Lease payments $ 76 $ 60 $ 38 $ 33 $ 26 $ 138 $ 371 Imputed lease interest ( 50 ) Total lease liabilities $ 321 11. Commitments and contingencies Purchase commitments Our purchase commitments include payments for software licenses and contractual arrangements with suppliers when there is a fixed, non-cancellable payment schedule or when minimum payments are due with a reduced delivery schedule. As of December 31, 2020, we had committed to make the following minimum payments under our purchase commitments: 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 Thereafter Total Purchase commitments $ 400 $ 127 $ 69 $ 31 $ 24 $ 96 $ 747 Indemnification guarantees We routinely sell products with an intellectual property indemnification included in the terms of sale. Historically, we have had only minimal, infrequent losses associated with these indemnities. Consequently, we cannot reasonably estimate any future liabilities that may result. Warranty costs/product liabilities We accrue for known product-related claims if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. During the periods presented, there have been no material accruals or payments regarding product warranty or product liability. Historically, we have experienced a low rate of payments on product claims. Although we cannot predict the likelihood or amount of any future claims, we do not believe they will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Our stated warranties for semiconductor products obligate us to repair, replace or credit the purchase price of a covered product back to the buyer. Product claim consideration may exceed the price of our products. General We are subject to various legal and administrative proceedings. Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of these matters, we believe that the results of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 51 12. Supplemental financial information Restructuring charges/other Restructuring charges/other are included in Other for segment reporting purposes and are comprised of the following components: For Years Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Restructuring charges (a) $ 25 $ ( 15 ) $ 6 Gains on sales of assets ( 1 ) ( 21 ) ( 3 ) Restructuring charges/other $ 24 $ ( 36 ) $ 3 (a) Includes severance and benefits, accelerated depreciation, changes in estimates and other exit costs.

The restructuring accrual balances are reported as a component of either accrued expenses and other liabilities or other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, depending on the expected timing of payment. In 2020, we recognized $ 25 million of restructuring charges primarily for severance and benefit costs associated with our Embedded Processing business. As of December 31, 2020, $ 8 million of payments have been made. In January 2020, we announced a multiyear plan to close our two remaining factories with 150-millimeter production, which are more than 50 years old and located in Sherman and Dallas, Texas. Production will be transitioned from these sites to our more advanced and cost-effective 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facilities in North Texas. We expect this transition to be completed in the next two to four years . Charges for these closures cannot be reasonably estimated until a later phase of the transition.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 5, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical a udit matter The critical audit matter communicated is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates. 55 Uncertain tax positions Description of the matter As discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company operates in the United States and multiple international tax jurisdictions, and its income tax returns are subject to examination by tax authorities in those jurisdictions who may challenge any tax position on these returns. Uncertainty in a tax position may arise because tax laws are subject to interpretation. The Company uses significant judgment to (1) determine whether, based on the technical merits, a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and (2) measure the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. Auditing management’s estimate of the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition involved auditor judgment because management’s estimate is complex, requires a high degree of judgment and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings. How we addressed the matter in our audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s accounting process for uncertain tax positions. For example, this included controls over the Company’s assessment of the technical merits of tax positions and management’s process to measure the benefit of those tax positions. Among other procedures performed, we involved our tax professionals to assess the technical merits of the Company’s tax positions. This included assessing the Company’s correspondence with the relevant tax authorities and evaluating income tax opinions or other third-party advice obtained by the Company. We also evaluated the appropriateness of the Company’s accounting for its tax positions taking into consideration relevant international and local income tax laws and legal rulings. We analyzed the Company’s assumptions and data used to determine the amount of tax benefit to recognize and tested the accuracy of the calculations. We also evaluated the adequacy of the Company’s financial statement disclosures in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements related to these tax matters.

Controls and procedures Disclosure controls and procedures An evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that those disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Internal control over financial reportin g Report by management on internal control over financial reporting The management of TI is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. TI’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements issued for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2020 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. TI management assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria) in Internal Control − Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2020, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on the COSO criteria. TI’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which immediately follows this report. 57 Report of independent registered public accounting firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Texas Instruments Incorporated Opinion on internal control over financial reporting We have audited Texas Instruments Incorporated’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Texas Instruments Incorporated (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes, and our report dated February 5, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying report by management on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

PART I ITEM 1. Business We design and make semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. Our operations began in 1930, and we are incorporated in Delaware. With headquarters in Dallas, Texas, we have design, manufacturing or sales operations in more than 30 countries. Our two reportable segments are Analog and Embedded Processing, and we report the results of our remaining business activities in Other. In 2019, we generated $14.38 billion of revenue. For many years, we have run our business with three overarching ambitions in mind. First, we will act like owners who will own the company for decades. Second, we will adapt and succeed in a world that is ever changing. And third, we will be a company that we are personally proud to be a part of and that we would want as our neighbor. When we are successful in achieving these ambitions, our employees, customers, communities and shareholders all win. Our business model is designed around four sustainable competitive advantages that we believe, in combination, put us in a unique class of companies. These advantages include (i) a strong foundation of manufacturing and technology, (ii) a broad portfolio of differentiated analog and embedded processing products, (iii) reach of market channels including our sales force and TI.com and (iv) diversity and longevity of our products, markets and customer positions. Our strategic focus, and where we invest the majority of our resources, is on Analog and Embedded Processing, with a particular emphasis on designing and selling those products into the industrial and automotive markets. We believe these markets represent the best growth opportunities over the next decade or longer, due to increasing semiconductor content. Additionally, analog and embedded processing products sold into industrial and automotive markets provide long product life cycles, intrinsic diversity and less capital-intensive manufacturing, which we believe offer stability, profitability and strong cash generation. This business model is the foundation of our capital management strategy, which is based on our belief that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is important for maximizing shareholder value over the long term. We also believe that free cash flow (cash flow from operations less capital expenditures) will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. TI’s business model puts us in a unique class of companies with the ability to grow, generate cash and return that cash to shareholders. The combined effect of our ambitions, business model and sustainable competitive advantages is that we have continued to build a stronger company. Over time, we have gained market share in Analog and Embedded Processing and grown and returned all free cash flow to our owners. Product information Semiconductors are electronic components that serve as the building blocks inside modern electronic systems and equipment. Semiconductors, generally known as “chips,” combine multiple transistors to form a complete electronic circuit. We have tens of thousands of products that are used to accomplish many different things, such as converting and amplifying signals, interfacing with other devices, managing and distributing power, processing data, canceling noise and improving signal resolution. This broad portfolio includes products that are integral to almost all electronic equipment. Our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels. Our segments also reflect how management allocates resources and measures results. Analog Our Analog segment generated $10.22 billion of revenue in 2019. Analog semiconductors change real-world signals, such as sound, temperature, pressure or images, by conditioning them, amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors. Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in all electronic equipment by converting, distributing, storing, discharging, isolating and measuring electrical energy, whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or using a battery. Our Analog products are used in many markets, particularly industrial, automotive and personal electronics. Sales of our Analog products generated about 71% of our revenue in 2019. According to external sources, the market for analog semiconductors was about $54 billion in 2019. Our Analog segment’s revenue in 2019 was about 19% of this fragmented market, which is the leading position. We believe we are well positioned to increase our market share over time. 2 Our Analog segment includes the following major product lines: Power, Signal Chain and High Volume. Power Power includes products that help customers manage power in electronic systems. Our broad portfolio is designed to manage power requirements across different voltage levels using battery management solutions, portable components, power supply controls, point-of-load products, switches and interfaces, integrated protection devices, high-voltage products and mobile lighting and display products. Signal Chain Signal Chain includes products that sense, condition and measure real-world signals to allow information to be transferred or converted for further processing and control. Our Signal Chain products, which serve a variety of end markets, include amplifiers, data converters, interface products, motor drives, clocks and sensing products. High Volume High Volume includes integrated analog and standard products that are primarily sold into markets such as personal electronics, industrial and automotive. These products support applications like displays and automotive safety systems. Embedded Processing Our Embedded Processing segment generated $2.94 billion of revenue in 2019. Embedded Processing products are the “brains” of many types of electronic equipment. Embedded processors are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for various combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application. Our devices vary from simple, low-cost microcontrollers used in applications such as electric toothbrushes to highly specialized, complex devices used in automotive applications such as infotainment systems and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). Our Embedded Processing products are used in many markets, particularly industrial and automotive. An important characteristic of our Embedded Processing products is that our customers often invest their own research and development (R&D) to write software that operates on our products. This investment tends to increase the length of our customer relationships because many customers prefer to re-use software from one product generation to the next. Sales of Embedded Processing products generated about 20% of our revenue in 2019. According to external sources, the market for embedded processors was about $18 billion in 2019. Our Embedded Processing segment’s revenue in 2019 was about 16% of this fragmented market, which is among the leaders. We believe we are well positioned to increase our market share over time. Our Embedded Processing segment includes the following major product lines: Connected Microcontrollers and Processors. Connected Microcontrollers Connected Microcontrollers includes microcontrollers, microcontrollers with integrated wireless capabilities and stand-alone wireless connectivity solutions. Microcontrollers are self-contained systems with a processor core, memory and peripherals that are designed to control a set of specific tasks for electronic equipment. Processors Processors includes digital signal processors (DSPs) and applications processors. DSPs perform mathematical computations almost instantaneously to process or improve digital data. Applications processors are designed for specific computing activity. Other We report the results of our remaining business activities in Other, which includes operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for individually reportable segments and cannot be aggregated with other operating segments. Other generated $1.22 billion of revenue in 2019 and includes revenue from DLP ® products (primarily used in projectors to create high-definition images), calculators and certain custom semiconductors known as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). 3 In Other, we also include items that are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments. Examples of these items include acquisition charges, restructuring charges, and certain corporate-level items, such as litigation expenses, environmental costs, insurance settlements and gains and losses from other activities, including asset dispositions. Markets for our products The table below lists the major markets for our products in 2019 and the estimated percentage of our 2019 revenue that the market represented. The chart also lists, in declining order of our revenue, the sectors within each market. Market Sector Industrial Factory automation & control (36% of TI revenue) Building automation Grid infrastructure Medical Aerospace & defense Test & measurement Appliances Pro audio, video & signage Motor drives Power delivery Retail automation & payments Industrial transport Lighting Automotive Infotainment & cluster (21% of TI revenue) Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) Passive safety Hybrid, electric & powertrain systems Body electronics & lighting Personal electronics Mobile phones (23% of TI revenue) Portable electronics PC & notebooks Connected peripherals & printers Home theatre & entertainment TV Tablets Wearables (non-medical) Data storage Gaming Communications equipment Wireless infrastructure (11% of TI revenue) Wired networking Broadband fixed line access Datacom module Enterprise systems Data center & enterprise computing (6% of TI revenue) Enterprise projectors Enterprise machine Other (calculators and other) (3% of TI revenue) Market characteristics Competitive landscape Despite recent consolidation, the analog and embedded processing markets remain highly fragmented. As a result, we face significant global competition from dozens of large and small companies, including both broad-based suppliers and niche suppliers. Our competitors also include emerging companies, particularly in Asia, that sell products into the same markets in which we operate. 4 We believe that competitive performance in the semiconductor market generally depends on several factors, including the breadth of a company’s product line, the strength and depth of its channels to market, technological innovation, product development execution, technical support, customer service, quality, reliability, manufacturing capacity and capabilities and price. In addition, manufacturing process and package technologies that provide differentiated levels of performance and a structural cost advantage are competitive factors for our Analog products, and customers’ prior investments in software development is a competitive factor for our Embedded Processing products. Product cycle The global semiconductor market is characterized by constant, though generally incremental, advances in product designs and manufacturing processes. Semiconductor prices and manufacturing costs tend to decline over time as manufacturing processes and product life cycles mature. Market cycle The “semiconductor cycle” refers to the ebb and flow of supply and demand and the building and depleting of inventories. The semiconductor market historically has been characterized by periods of tight supply caused by strengthening demand and/or insufficient manufacturing capacity, followed by periods of surplus inventory caused by weakening demand and/or excess manufacturing capacity. These are typically referred to as upturns and downturns in the semiconductor cycle. The semiconductor cycle could be affected by the significant time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing facilities. We employ several strategies to dampen the effect of the semiconductor cycle on TI. We focus our resources on analog and embedded processing products and industrial and automotive markets. These products and markets serve a large and diverse customer base, which reduces our dependence on the performance of a single market or small group of customers. Industrial and automotive markets also benefit from long product life cycles, which help to smooth the impact of cyclicality. In addition, we plan manufacturing facility and equipment expansion ahead of demand, as well as utilize consignment inventory programs to give us improved insight into customer demand and more accurately manage factory loadings. Seasonality Our revenue is subject to some seasonal variation. Historically, our sequential revenue growth rate tends to be weaker in the first and fourth quarters when compared with the second and third quarters. Customers, sales and distribution We sell our products to about 100,000 customers. Our customer base is diverse, with more than one-third of our revenue derived from customers outside our largest 100. We market and sell our products through direct sales channels, including our broad sales force and our website, and through distributors. In 2019, about 65% of our sales were fulfilled through our distributors, and they maintain inventory of our products. Over the past several years, we have been investing in new capabilities and evolving our distribution network to better align with our strategy to establish closer, more direct relationships with our customers. Closer direct customer relationships give us better insight into customer needs and allow us to provide better service and greater assurance of supply, among other benefits. As we expand these direct customer relationships over the next several years, we will have less business flowing through the distribution channel and therefore will require fewer distributors. Our investments in new and improved capabilities to directly support our customers include website and e-commerce enhancements as well as inventory consignment programs and order fulfillment services. Manufacturing Semiconductor manufacturing begins with a sequence of photolithographic and chemical processing steps that fabricate a number of semiconductor devices on a thin silicon wafer. Each device on the wafer is packaged and tested. The entire process takes place in highly specialized facilities, with most products requiring about two to three months for completion. 5 We own and operate semiconductor manufacturing facilities in North America, Asia, Japan and Europe. These include both wafer fabrication and assembly/test facilities. Our facilities require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixed-cost assets once in operation. We invest in manufacturing technologies and do most of our manufacturing in-house. This strategic decision to directly control our manufacturing helps ensure a consistent supply of products for our customers and also allows us to invest in technology that differentiates the features of our products. We have focused on creating a competitive manufacturing cost advantage by investing in our advanced analog 300-millimeter capacity, which has about a 40% cost advantage per unpackaged chip over 200-millimeter. To strengthen this advantage, we are moving forward with our plan to build our new 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facility in Richardson, Texas, as 300-millimeter wafers will continue to support the majority of our Analog growth. We expect to continue to maintain sufficient internal manufacturing capacity to meet the majority of our production needs and to obtain manufacturing equipment to support new technology developments and revenue growth. To supplement our manufacturing capacity and maximize our responsiveness to customer demand, we use the capacity of outside suppliers, commonly known as foundries, and subcontractors. In 2019, we sourced about 20% of our total wafers from external foundries, most of which support our Embedded Processing segment, and about 40% of our assembly/test services from subcontractors. Inventory Our objectives for inventory are to maintain high levels of customer service and stable lead times, minimize inventory obsolescence and improve manufacturing asset utilization. To meet these objectives and to allow greater flexibility in periods of high demand, we build ahead of demand long-lived, low-volume products and maintain inventory of other products that have a broad customer base and low risk of obsolescence. Further, we have improved insight into demand and are better able to manage our factory loadings because over time we have increased consignment inventory programs and are building closer, more direct relationships with our customers. In 2019, about 65% of TI revenue was fulfilled from consignment programs. Our strategy and expected customer demand will cause our inventory levels to fluctuate over time. Backlog We define backlog as of a particular date as purchase orders with a customer-requested delivery date within a specified length of time. Our backlog at any particular date may not be indicative of revenue for any future period. As customer requirements and industry conditions change, orders may be subject to cancellation or modification of terms such as pricing, quantity or delivery date. Customer order placement practices continually evolve based on customers’ individual business needs and capabilities, as well as industry supply and capacity considerations. Further, our consignment programs do not result in backlog because the order occurs at the same time as delivery, i.e., when the customer pulls the product from consigned inventory. Our backlog of orders was $1.0 billion at December 31, 2019, and $1.5 billion at December 31, 2018. Raw materials We purchase materials, parts and supplies from a number of suppliers. In some cases we purchase such items from sole-source suppliers. The materials, parts and supplies essential to our business are generally available at present, and we believe that such materials, parts and supplies will be available in the foreseeable future. Intellectual property We own many patents, and have many patent applications pending, in the United States and other countries in fields relating to our business. We have developed a strong, broad-based patent portfolio and continually add patents to that portfolio. We also have license agreements, which vary in duration, involving rights to our portfolio or those of other companies. We do not consider our business materially dependent upon any one patent or patent license. We often participate in industry initiatives to set technical standards. Our competitors may participate in the same initiatives. Participation in these initiatives may require us to license certain of our patents to other companies on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. We own trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business. These trademarks are valuable assets, the most important of which are “Texas Instruments” and our corporate monogram. 6 Executive officers of the Registrant The following is an alphabetical list of the names and ages of the executive officers of the company and the positions or offices with the company held by each person named: Name Age Position Niels Anderskouv 50 Senior Vice President Ahmad S.

ITEM 1A. Risk factors You should read the following risk factors in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and in materials incorporated by reference into these filings. These risk factors are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to TI, a company with broad international operations. Like many companies, we are susceptible to a potential downturn associated with macroeconomic weakness, which may affect our performance and the performance of our customers. Similarly, the price of our securities is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions, actual financial results that do not meet our and/or the investment community’s expectations, changes in our and/or the investment community’s expectations for our future results, dividends or share repurchases, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. 7 Our global operations subject us to risks associated with domestic or international political, social, economic or other conditions. We have facilities in more than 30 countries. About 85% of our revenue comes from shipments to locations outside the United States; shipments of products into China represent a large portion of our revenue. Certain countries where we operate have experienced, and other countries may experience, increasing protectionism that affects global trade and macroeconomic conditions through the enactment of tariffs, import or export restrictions, trade embargoes and sanctions, restrictions on cross-border investment and other trade barriers. This protectionism impacts our ability to deliver products and product support into China, could cause Chinese customers to seek alternate suppliers and could otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial results. We are exposed to political, social and economic conditions, security risks, terrorism or other hostile acts, health conditions, labor conditions, and possible disruptions in transportation, communications and information technology networks of the various countries in which we operate. In addition, our global operations expose us to periods when the U.S. dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the non-U.S. currencies in which we transact business. The remeasurement of non-U.S. dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We face substantial competition that requires us to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressures. We face intense technological and pricing competition in the markets in which we operate. We expect this competition will continue to increase from large competitors and from small competitors serving niche markets, and also from emerging companies, particularly in Asia, that sell products into the same markets in which we operate. For example, we may face increased competition as a result of China actively promoting and reshaping its domestic semiconductor industry through policy changes and investment. These actions, in conjunction with trade tensions, may restrict us from participating in the China market or may prevent us from competing effectively. Certain competitors possess sufficient financial, technical and management resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably against our products, and consolidation among our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively. The price and product development pressures that result from competition may lead to reduced profit margins and lost business opportunities in the event that we are unable to match the price declines or cost efficiencies, or meet the technological, product, support, software or manufacturing advancements of our competitors. Changes in expected demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our customers include companies in a wide range of end markets and sectors within those markets. If demand in one or more sectors within our end markets declines or the rate of growth slows, our results of operations may be adversely affected. The cyclical nature of the semiconductor market occasionally leads to significant and rapid increases and decreases in product demand. Additionally, the loss or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of our large customers, including curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers, the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustments, or trade restrictions, may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our results of operations also might suffer because of a general decline in customer demand resulting from, for example: uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets; natural events or domestic or international political, social, economic or other conditions; breaches of customer information technology systems that disrupt customer operations; or a customer’s inability to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity. Our ability to match inventory and production with the product mix needed to fill orders may affect our ability to meet a quarter’s revenue forecast. In addition, when responding to customers’ requests for shorter shipment lead times, we manufacture products based on forecasts of customers’ demands. These forecasts are based on multiple assumptions. If we inaccurately forecast customer demand, we may hold inadequate, excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 8 Our operating results and our reputation could be adversely affected by breaches, disruptions or other incidents relating to our information technology systems. Breaches, disruptions or other incidents relating to our information technology systems or the systems of our customers, vendors and other third parties could be caused by factors such as computer viruses, system failures, restricted network access, unauthorized access, terrorism, employee malfeasance, or human error. These events could, among other things, compromise our information technology networks; result in corrupt or lost data or the unauthorized release of our, our customers’ or our suppliers’ confidential or proprietary information; cause a disruption to our manufacturing and other operations; result in the release of personal data; or cause us to incur costs associated with increased protection, remediation, regulatory inquiries or penalties, or claims for damages, any of which could adversely affect our operating results and our reputation. Cybersecurity or other threats to our information technology systems or the systems of our customers, vendors and other third parties are frequent and constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of defending against them. Our ability to successfully implement strategic, business and organizational changes could affect our business plans and results of operations. From time to time, we undertake strategic, business and organizational changes, including acquisitions, divestitures and restructuring actions, to support or carry out our objectives. Our failure to successfully implement these changes could adversely affect our business plans and operating results. We may not achieve or sustain the expected growth, cost savings or other benefits of strategic, business and organizational changes, and restructuring charges could differ materially in amount and timing from our expectations. Our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we operate. We have manufacturing, data and design facilities and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather, geological events or health epidemics that could disrupt operations. A natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption, particularly where we have principal manufacturing and design operations, as listed in Item 2. Properties, may adversely affect our results and financial condition. Rapid technological change in markets we serve requires us to develop new technologies and products. Rapid technological change in markets we serve could contribute to shortened product life cycles and a decline in average selling prices of our products. Our results of operations depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop, manufacture and market innovative products in a timely manner. We make significant investments in research and development to improve existing technology and products, develop new products to meet changing customer demands, and improve our production processes. In some cases, we might not realize a return or the expected return on our investments because they are generally made before commercial viability can be assured. Further, projects that are commercially viable may not contribute to our operating results until at least a few years after they are completed. We face supply chain and manufacturing risks. We rely on third parties to supply us with goods and services in a cost-effective and timely manner. Our access to needed goods and services may be adversely affected by potential disputes with suppliers or disruptions in our suppliers’ operations as a result of, for example: quality excursions; uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets; domestic or international political, social, economic and other conditions; natural events or health epidemics in the locations in which our suppliers operate; or limited or delayed access to key raw materials, natural resources and utilities. Additionally, a breach or other incident relating to our suppliers’ information technology systems could result in a release of confidential or proprietary information. If our suppliers are unable to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity, we may be unable to obtain needed supplies, collect accounts receivable or access needed technology. In particular, our manufacturing processes and critical manufacturing equipment require that certain key raw materials, natural resources and utilities be available. Limited or delayed access to and high costs of these items could adversely affect our results of operations. Our products contain materials that are subject to conflict minerals reporting requirements. Our relationships with customers and suppliers may be adversely affected if we are unable to describe our products as conflict-free. Additionally, our costs may increase if one or more of our customers demand that we change the sourcing of materials we cannot identify as conflict-free. 9 Our inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect our results of operations. We subcontract a portion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our products, and we depend on third parties to provide advanced logic manufacturing process technology development. We do not have long-term contracts with all of these suppliers, and the number of alternate suppliers is limited. Reliance on these suppliers involves risks, including possible shortages of capacity in periods of high demand, suppliers’ inability to develop and deliver advanced logic manufacturing process technology in a timely, cost effective, and appropriate manner, the possibility of suppliers’ imposition of increased costs on us and the unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property. Our results of operations and our reputation could be affected by warranty claims, product liability claims, product recalls or legal proceedings. Claims based on warranty, product liability, epidemic or delivery failures, or other grounds relating to our products, manufacturing, services, designs, communications or cybersecurity could lead to significant expenses as we defend the claims or pay damage awards or settlements. In the event of a claim, we would also incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected customer or end consumer. Any such claims may also cause us to write off the value of related inventory. We maintain product liability insurance, but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims. In addition, it is possible for a customer to recall a product containing a TI part, for example, with respect to products used in automotive applications or handheld electronics, which may cause us to incur costs and expenses relating to the recall. Any of these events could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and reputation. Our operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject. We are subject to complex laws, rules and regulations affecting our domestic and international operations relating to, for example, the environment, safety and health; trade; bribery and corruption; financial reporting; tax; data privacy and protection; labor and employment; competition; market access; intellectual property ownership and infringement; and the movement of currency. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive and could restrict our ability to manufacture or ship our products and operate our business. If we fail to comply or if we become subject to enforcement activity, we could be subject to fines, penalties or other legal liability. Furthermore, should these laws, rules and regulations be amended or expanded, or new ones enacted, we could incur materially greater compliance costs or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business. Some of these complex laws, rules and regulations – for example, those related to environmental, safety and health requirements – may particularly affect us in the jurisdictions in which we manufacture products, especially if such laws and regulations: require the use of abatement equipment beyond what we currently employ; require the addition or elimination of a raw material or process to or from our current manufacturing processes; or impose costs, fees or reporting requirements on the direct or indirect use of energy, natural resources, or materials or gases used or emitted into the environment in connection with the manufacture of our products. A substitute for a prohibited raw material or process might not be available, or might not be available at reasonable cost. Our results of operations could be affected by changes in tax-related matters. We have facilities in more than 30 countries and as a result are subject to taxation and audit by a number of taxing authorities. Tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate. If our tax rate increases, our results of operations could be adversely affected. A number of factors could cause our tax rate to increase, including a change in the jurisdictions in which our profits are earned and taxed; a change in the mix of profits from those jurisdictions; changes in available tax credits or deductions, including for amounts relating to stock compensation; changes in applicable tax rates; changes in tariff regulations or surcharges; changes in accounting principles; or adverse resolution of audits by taxing authorities. We have deferred tax assets on our balance sheet. Changes in applicable tax laws and regulations or in our business performance could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax assets, which could also affect our results of operations. In addition, we are subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction. These laws and regulations can be complex and subject to interpretation. Changes in these laws and regulations, including those that align with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting recommendations, could affect the locations where we are deemed to earn income, which could in turn affect our results of operations. Each quarter we forecast our tax expense based on our forecast of our performance for the year. If that performance forecast changes, our forecasted tax expense will change. 10 Our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if a customer or a distributor suffers a loss with respect to our inventory. We have consignment inventory programs in place for some of our largest customers and distributors. If a customer or distributor were to experience a loss with respect to TI-consigned inventory, our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected if we do not recover the full value of the lost inventory from the customer, distributor or insurer, or if our recovery is delayed. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by our distributors’ promotion of competing product lines or our distributors’ financial performance. In 2019, about 65% of our revenue was generated from sales of our products through distributors. Our distributors carry competing product lines, and our sales could be affected if our distributors promote competing products over our products. Moreover, our results of operations could be affected if our distributors suffer financial difficulties that result in their inability to pay amounts owed to us. Disputes with significant distributors could be disruptive or harmful to our business. Our margins vary. Our profit margins vary due to a number of factors, which may include customer demand and shipment volume; our manufacturing processes; product mix; inventory levels; tariffs; and new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting practices or standards. In addition, we operate in a highly competitive market environment that might adversely affect pricing for our products. Because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating costs is fixed. In general, these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or factory loadings, and can adversely affect profit margins as a result. Our performance depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights and to maintain freedom of operation. Access to worldwide markets depends in part on the continued strength of our intellectual property portfolio in all jurisdictions where we conduct business. There can be no assurance that, as our business evolves, we will obtain the necessary intellectual property rights, or that we will be able to independently develop the technology, software or know-how necessary to conduct our business or that we can do so without infringing the intellectual property rights of others. To the extent that we have to rely on licensed technology from others, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms we consider reasonable. We, directly or indirectly, face infringement claims from third parties, including non-practicing entities that have acquired patents to pursue enforcement actions against other companies. We also face infringement claims where we or our customers make, use or sell products and where the intellectual property laws may be less established or less predictable. These assertions, whether or not of any merit, expose us to claims for damages and/or injunctions from third parties, as well as claims for indemnification by our customers in instances where we have a contractual or other legal obligation to indemnify them against damages resulting from infringement claims. We actively enforce and protect our own intellectual property rights. However, our efforts cannot prevent all misappropriation or improper use of our protected technology and information, including, for example, third parties’ use of our patented or copyrighted technology, or our trade secrets in their products without the right to do so, or third parties’ sale of counterfeit products bearing our trademark. The risk of unfair copying or cloning may impede our ability to sell our products. The laws of countries where we operate may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as U.S. laws. Our debt could affect our operations and financial condition. From time to time, we issue debt securities with various interest rates and maturities. While we believe we will have the ability to service this debt, our ability to make principal and interest payments when due depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles, and business and other factors affecting our operations, including our other risk factors, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, our obligation to make principal and interest payments could divert funds that otherwise would be invested in our operations or returned to shareholders, or could cause us to raise funds by, for example, issuing new debt or equity or selling assets. 11 Our results of operations and liquidity could be affected by changes in the financial markets. We maintain bank accounts, one or more multiyear revolving credit agreements, and a portfolio of investments to support the financing needs of the company. Our ability to fund our operations, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, service our debt obligations and meet our cash return objectives depends upon continuous access to our bank and investment accounts, and may depend on access to our bank credit lines that support commercial paper borrowings and provide additional liquidity through short-term bank loans. If we are unable to access these accounts and credit lines (for example, due to instability in the financial markets), our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected and our ability to access the capital markets or redeem our investments could be restricted. Increases in health care and pension benefit costs could affect our results of operations and financial condition. Federal and state health care reform programs could increase our costs with regard to medical coverage of our employees, which could reduce profitability and affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, obligations related to our pension and other postretirement plans reflect assumptions that affect the planned funding and costs of these plans, including the actual return on plan assets, discount rates, plan participant population demographics and changes in pension regulations. Changes in these assumptions may affect plan funding, cash flow and results of operations, and our costs and funding obligations could increase significantly if our plans’ actual experience differs from these assumptions. Our continued success depends in part on our ability to retain and recruit a sufficient number of qualified employees in a competitive environment. Our continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel, as well as the effective management of succession for key employees. Skilled and experienced personnel in our industry, including engineering, management, marketing, technical and staff personnel, are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key engineering, management and technical personnel that we require to execute our business strategy. Our ability to recruit internationally or deploy employees to various locations may be limited by immigration laws. Material impairments of our goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our results of operations. We have a significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet. Charges associated with impairments of goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. ITEM 1B. Unresolved staff comments Not applicable. 12 ITEM 2. Properties Our principal executive offices are located at 12500 TI Boulevard, Dallas, Texas.

Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Overview We design, make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. For many years, we have run our business with three overarching ambitions in mind. First, we will act like owners who will own the company for decades. Second, we will adapt and succeed in a world that is ever changing. And third, we will be a company that we are personally proud to be a part of and that we would want as our neighbor. When we are successful in achieving these ambitions, our employees, customers, communities and shareholders all win. Our business model is designed around the following four sustainable competitive advantages that we believe, in combination, put us in a unique class of companies: • A strong foundation of manufacturing and technology. We invest in manufacturing technologies and do most of our manufacturing in-house. This strategic decision to directly control our manufacturing helps ensure a consistent supply of products for our customers and also allows us to invest in technology that differentiates the features of our products. We have focused on creating a competitive manufacturing cost advantage by investing in our advanced analog 300-millimeter capacity, which has about a 40% cost advantage per unpackaged chip over 200-millimeter. To strengthen this advantage, we are moving forward with our plan to build our new 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facility in Richardson, Texas, as 300-millimeter wafers will continue to support the majority of our Analog growth. • Broad portfolio of differentiated analog and embedded processing products. Our customers need multiple chips for their systems. The breadth of our portfolio means we can meet more of these needs than our competitors can, which gives us access to more customers and the opportunity to sell more products and generate more revenue per customer system. We invest more than $1 billion each year to develop new products for our portfolio, which includes tens of thousands of products. • Reach of market channels. Customers often begin their initial product selection process and design-in journey on our website, and the breadth of our portfolio attracts more customers to our website than any of our competitors’ websites. Our web presence and global sales and applications team are advantages that give us unique access and insight to about 100,000 customers designing TI semiconductors into their end products. • Diversity and longevity of our products, markets and customer positions. Together, the attributes above result in diverse and long-lived positions that deliver high terminal value to our shareholders. Because of the breadth of our portfolio, we are not dependent on any single product, customer, technology or market. Some of our products generate revenue for decades, which strengthens the return on our investments. Our strategic focus, and where we invest the majority of our resources, is on Analog and Embedded Processing, with a particular emphasis on designing and selling those products into the industrial and automotive markets. We believe these markets represent the best growth opportunities over the next decade or longer, due to increasing semiconductor content. Additionally, analog and embedded processing products sold into industrial and automotive markets provide long product life cycles, intrinsic diversity and less capital-intensive manufacturing, which we believe offer stability, profitability and strong cash generation. This business model is the foundation of our capital management strategy, which is based on our belief that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is important for maximizing shareholder value over the long term. We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. The combined effect of our ambitions, business model and sustainable competitive advantages is that we have continued to build a stronger company. Over time, we have gained market share in Analog and Embedded Processing and grown and returned all free cash flow to our owners. Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document. In the following discussion of our results of operations: • Our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels, and how management allocates resources and measures results. See Note 1 to the financial statements for more information regarding our segments. 16 • When we discuss our results: ◦ Unless otherwise noted, changes in our revenue are attributable to changes in customer demand, which are evidenced by fluctuations in shipment volumes. ◦ New products do not tend to have a significant impact on our revenue in any given period because we sell such a large number of products. ◦ From time to time, our revenue and gross profit are affected by changes in demand for higher-priced or lower-priced products, which we refer to as changes in the “mix” of products shipped. ◦ Because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed. When factory loadings decrease, our fixed costs are spread over reduced output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins decrease. Conversely, as factory loadings increase, our fixed costs are spread over increased output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins increase. Increases and decreases in factory loadings tend to correspond to increases and decreases in demand. • All dollar amounts in the tables are stated in millions of U.S. dollars. Our results of operations discussed below provides details of our financial results for 2019 and 2018 and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018. Discussion of 2017 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2018 and 2017 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. Results of operations In 2019, we continued our focus on analog and embedded processing products and the industrial and automotive markets. Together, these products and markets represent highly diverse opportunities with thousands of applications and long-term growth potential. Gross margin of 63.7% reflected the quality of our product portfolio, as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, including the benefit of 300-millimeter Analog production. Our focus on Analog and Embedded Processing allows us to generate strong cash flow from operations. Our cash flow from operations of $6.65 billion underscored the strength of our business model. Free cash flow was $5.80 billion and represented 40.3% of revenue, up from 38.4% a year ago. During 2019, we returned $5.97 billion to shareholders through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends. Our strategy is to return all free cash flow to shareholders. Our dividends represented 52% of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability. For an explanation of free cash flow, see the Non-GAAP financial information section. Details of financial results – 2019 compared with 2018 Revenue of $14.38 billion decreased $1.40 billion, or 9%, primarily due to lower revenue from Embedded Processing and Analog. Gross profit of $9.16 billion was down $1.11 billion, or 11%, primarily due to lower revenue. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit decreased to 63.7% from 65.1%. Operating expenses (R&D and SG&A) were $3.19 billion compared with $3.24 billion. Acquisition charges of $288 million were non-cash. See Note 7 to the financial statements. Restructuring charges/other was a credit of $36 million due to the sale of our manufacturing facility in Greenock, Scotland. Operating profit was $5.72 billion, or 39.8% of revenue, compared with $6.71 billion, or 42.5% of revenue. Other income and expense (OI&E) was $175 million of income compared with $98 million of income. See Note 12 to the financial statements. Interest and debt expense of $170 million increased $45 million due to the issuance of additional long-term debt. 17 Our provision for income taxes was $711 million compared with $1.11 billion. The decrease was due to lower income before income taxes and a lower annual operating tax rate. Our annual operating tax rate, which does not include discrete tax items, was 16% compared with 20% in 2018. We use “annual operating tax rate” to describe the estimated annual effective tax rate, as explained further in the Non-GAAP financial information section. Our effective tax rate, which includes discrete tax items, was 12% in 2019 compared with 17% in 2018. See Note 4 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the U.S. statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate. Net income was $5.02 billion compared with $5.58 billion. EPS was $5.24 compared with $5.59. Segment results – 2019 compared with 2018 Analog (includes Power, Signal Chain and High Volume product lines) 2019 2018 Change Revenue $ 10,223 $ 10,801 (5) % Operating profit 4,477 5,109 (12) % Operating profit % of revenue 43.8 % 47.3 % Analog revenue decreased due to Power, High Volume and, to a lesser extent, Signal Chain. Operating profit decreased primarily due to lower revenue and associated gross profit. Embedded Processing (includes Connected Microcontrollers and Processors product lines) 2019 2018 Change Revenue $ 2,943 $ 3,554 (17) % Operating profit 907 1,205 (25) % Operating profit % of revenue 30.8 % 33.9 % Embedded Processing revenue decreased in both product lines, led by Processors. Operating profit decreased due to lower revenue and associated gross profit. Other (includes DLP ® products, calculators and custom ASIC products) 2019 2018 Change Revenue $ 1,217 $ 1,429 (15) % Operating profit * 339 399 (15) % Operating profit % of revenue 27.9 % 27.9 % * Includes acquisition charges and restructuring charges/other Other revenue decreased $212 million, and operating profit decreased $60 million. Financial condition At the end of 2019, total cash (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments) was $5.39 billion, an increase of $1.15 billion from the end of 2018. Accounts receivable were $1.07 billion, a decrease of $133 million compared with the end of 2018. Days sales outstanding were 29 at the end of both 2019 and 2018. Inventory was $2.00 billion, a decrease of $216 million from the end of 2018. Days of inventory at the end of 2019 were 144 compared with 152 at the end of 2018. Liquidity and capital resources Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations. Additional sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and a variable rate, revolving credit facility. Cash flows from operating activities for 2019 were $6.65 billion, a decrease of $540 million primarily due to lower net income. 18 Our revolving credit facility is with a consortium of investment-grade banks and allows us to borrow up to $2 billion until March 2024. This credit facility also serves as support for the issuance of commercial paper. As of December 31, 2019, our credit facility was undrawn, and we had no commercial paper outstanding. Investing activities for 2019 used $1.92 billion compared with $78 million in 2018. Capital expenditures were $847 million compared with $1.13 billion in 2018 and were primarily for semiconductor manufacturing equipment in both periods. Short-term investments used cash of $1.14 billion in 2019 and provided cash proceeds of $1.07 billion in 2018. Financing activities for 2019 used $4.73 billion compared with $6.33 billion in 2018. In 2019, we received net proceeds of $1.49 billion from the issuance of fixed-rate, long-term debt and retired maturing debt of $750 million. In 2018, we received net proceeds of $1.50 billion from the issuance of fixed-rate, long-term debt and retired maturing debt of $500 million. Dividends paid in 2019 were $3.01 billion compared with $2.56 billion in 2018, reflecting an increase in the dividend rate, partially offset by fewer shares outstanding. We used $2.96 billion to repurchase 27.4 million shares of our common stock compared with $5.10 billion used in 2018 to repurchase 49.5 million shares. Employee exercises of stock options provided cash proceeds of $539 million compared with $373 million in 2018. We had $2.44 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $2.95 billion of short-term investments as of December 31, 2019. We believe we have the necessary financial resources and operating plans to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend and debt-related payments, and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months. Non-GAAP financial information This MD&A includes references to free cash flow and ratios based on that measure. These are financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). Free cash flow was calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from the most directly comparable GAAP measure, cash flows from operating activities (also referred to as cash flow from operations). We believe that free cash flow and the associated ratios provide insight into our liquidity, our cash-generating capability and the amount of cash potentially available to return to shareholders, as well as insight into our financial performance. These non-GAAP measures are supplemental to the comparable GAAP measures. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in the table below. For Years Ended December 31, 2019 2018 Cash flow from operations (GAAP) $ 6,649 $ 7,189 Capital expenditures (847) (1,131) Free cash flow (non-GAAP) $ 5,802 $ 6,058 Revenue $ 14,383 $ 15,784 Cash flow from operations as a percentage of revenue (GAAP) 46.2 % 45.5 % Free cash flow as a percentage of revenue (non-GAAP) 40.3 % 38.4 % This MD&A also includes references to an annual operating tax rate, a non-GAAP term we use to describe the estimated annual effective tax rate, a GAAP measure that by definition does not include discrete tax items. We believe the term annual operating tax rate helps differentiate from the effective tax rate, which includes discrete tax items. 19 Long-term contractual obligations Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations 2020 2021/2022 2023/2024 Thereafter Total Long-term debt (a) $ 669 $ 1,349 $ 1,060 $ 5,488 $ 8,566 Purchase commitments (b) 452 407 97 109 1,065 Transition tax on indefinitely reinvested earnings (c) — 100 237 169 506 Operating leases (d) 75 114 66 131 386 Deferred compensation plans (e) 23 63 54 135 275 Total (f) $ 1,219 $ 2,033 $ 1,514 $ 6,032 $ 10,798 (a) Principal and related interest payments for our long-term debt obligations, including amounts classified as the current portion of long-term debt. (b) Includes payments for software licenses and contractual arrangements with suppliers when there is a fixed, non-cancellable payment schedule or when minimum payments are due with a reduced delivery schedule. Excludes cancellable arrangements. See Note 11 to the financial statements. (c) Includes payments for the one-time transition tax on our indefinitely reinvested earnings related to the 2017 enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. See Note 4 to the financial statements. (d) Includes minimum payments for leased facilities and equipment and purchases of industrial gases under contracts accounted for as operating leases. See Note 10 to the financial statements. (e) Estimated payments for certain liabilities that existed as of December 31, 2019. (f) Excludes $303 million of uncertain tax liabilities under ASC 740, as well as any planned future funding contributions to retirement benefit plans. Amounts associated with uncertain tax liabilities have been excluded because of the difficulty in making reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities. Regarding future funding of retirement benefit plans, we plan to contribute about $20 million in 2020, but funding projections beyond 2020 are not practical to estimate due to the rules affecting tax-deductible contributions and the impact from the plans’ asset performance, interest rates and potential U.S. and non-U.S. legislation. Critical accounting policies Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements. As disclosed in Note 2, the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. However, based on facts and circumstances inherent in developing estimates and assumptions, management believes it is unlikely that applying other estimates and assumptions would have a material impact on the financial statements. We consider the following accounting policies to be those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and that require a higher degree of judgment. Revenue recognition Based on management’s assessment of the revenue recognition criteria, we generally recognize revenue from sales of our products to distributors upon shipment or delivery to the distributors. For our consignment arrangements with distributors, delivery occurs and revenue is recognized when the distributor pulls product from consignment inventory that we store at designated locations. Recognition is not contingent upon resale of the products to the distributors’ customers in either scenario. Revenue is recognized net of allowances, which are management’s estimates of future credits to be granted to distributors under programs common in the semiconductor industry. These allowances are not material and generally include special pricing arrangements, product returns due to quality issues, and incentives designed to maximize growth opportunities. Allowances are based on analysis of historical data and contractual terms and are recorded when revenue is recognized. We believe we can reasonably and reliably estimate allowances for credits to distributors in a timely manner. 20 Income taxes In determining net income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax provisions and the resultant tax liabilities and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. In the ordinary course of global business, there may be many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. The calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the interpretation and application of complex tax laws, and significant judgment is necessary to (i) determine whether, based on the technical merits, a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and (ii) measure the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. Although we believe the estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different from what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals. As part of our financial process, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered. If recovery is not likely, the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are estimated not to be ultimately recoverable. Our judgment regarding future recoverability of our deferred tax assets may change due to various factors, including changes in U.S. or international tax laws and changes in market conditions and their impact on our assessment of taxable income in future periods. These changes, if any, may require adjustments to the deferred tax assets and an accompanying reduction or increase in net income in the period when such determinations are made. Inventory valuation allowances Inventory is valued net of allowances for unsalable or obsolete raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods. Statistical allowances are determined quarterly for raw materials and work-in-process based on historical disposals of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons. For finished goods, quarterly statistical allowances are determined by comparing inventory levels of individual parts to historical shipments, current backlog and estimated future sales in order to identify inventory considered unlikely to be sold. A specific allowance for each material type will be carried if there is a significant event not captured by the statistical allowance, such as an end-of-life part or demand with imminent risk of cancellation. Allowances are also calculated quarterly for instances where inventoried costs for individual products are in excess of the net realizable value for those products. Actual future write-offs of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons may differ from estimates and calculations used to determine valuation allowances due to changes in customer demand, customer negotiations, technology shifts and other factors. Changes in accounting standards See Note 2 to the financial statements for information regarding the status of new accounting and reporting standards. Off-balance sheet arrangements As of December 31, 2019, we had no significant off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. Commitments and contingencies See Note 11 to the financial statements for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies. 21 ITEM 7A. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk Foreign exchange risk The U.S. dollar is our functional currency for financial reporting. Our non-U.S. entities own assets or liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars or other currencies. Exchange rate fluctuations impact taxable income in those jurisdictions and consequently impact our effective tax rate. Our balance sheet also reflects amounts remeasured from non-U.S. dollar currencies. Because most of the aggregate non-U.S. dollar balance sheet exposure is hedged by forward currency exchange contracts, based on year-end 2019 balances and currency exchange rates, a hypothetical 10% plus or minus fluctuation in non-U.S. currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar would result in a pretax currency exchange gain or loss of less than $1 million. We use these forward currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings impact that exchange rate fluctuations may have on our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures. As of December 31, 2019, we had forward currency exchange contracts outstanding with a notional value of $458 million to hedge net balance sheet exposures (including $136 million to sell Japanese yen, $106 million to sell Indian rupees and $74 million to sell British pounds). Similar hedging activities existed at year-end 2018. Interest rate risk We have the following potential exposure to changes in interest rates: (i) the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and short-term investments, which could produce a gain or a loss; and (ii) the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our debt. As of December 31, 2019, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and short-term investments by about $8 million and decrease the fair value of our long-term debt by $532 million. Because interest rates on our long-term debt are fixed, changes in interest rates would not affect the cash flows associated with long-term debt. Equity risk Long-term investments at year-end 2019 include the following: • Investments in mutual funds – includes mutual funds that were selected to generate returns that offset changes in certain liabilities related to deferred compensation arrangements. The mutual funds hold a variety of debt and equity investments. • Investments in venture capital funds – includes investments in limited partnerships (accounted for under either the equity method or at cost as non-marketable equity securities). • Equity investments – includes non-marketable (non-publicly traded) equity securities. Investments in mutual funds are stated at fair value. Changes in prices of the mutual fund investments are expected to offset related changes in deferred compensation liabilities such that a 10% increase or decrease in the investments’ fair values would not materially affect operating results. Non-marketable equity securities and certain venture capital funds are stated at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes. Investments in the remaining venture capital funds are stated using the equity method. See Note 6 to the financial statements for details of equity and other long-term investments. 22 ITEM 8.

Description of business, including segment and geographic area information We design, make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. We have two reportable segments, which are established along major categories of products as follows: • Analog – consisting of the following product lines: Power, Signal Chain and High Volume. • Embedded Processing – consisting of the following product lines: Connected Microcontrollers and Processors. We report the results of our remaining business activities in Other. Other includes operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for individually reportable segments and cannot be aggregated with other operating segments. Other includes DLP ® products, calculators and custom ASIC products. In Other, we also include items that are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments. Examples of these items include acquisition charges (see Note 7); restructuring charges (see Note 12); and certain corporate-level items, such as litigation expenses, environmental costs, insurance settlements, and gains and losses from other activities, including asset dispositions. We allocate the remainder of our expenses associated with corporate activities to our operating segments based on specific methodologies, such as percentage of operating expenses or headcount. Our centralized manufacturing and support organizations, such as facilities, procurement and logistics, provide support to our operating segments, including those in Other. Costs incurred by these organizations, including depreciation, are charged to the segments on a per-unit basis. Consequently, depreciation expense is not an independently identifiable component within the segments’ results and therefore is not provided. With the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segment, nor does the chief operating decision maker evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information. We have no material intersegment revenue. The accounting policies of the segments are consistent with those described below in the summary of significant accounting policies and practices. Segment information For Years Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Revenue: Analog $ 10,223 $ 10,801 $ 9,900 Embedded Processing 2,943 3,554 3,498 Other 1,217 1,429 1,563 Total revenue $ 14,383 $ 15,784 $ 14,961 Operating profit: Analog $ 4,477 $ 5,109 $ 4,468 Embedded Processing 907 1,205 1,143 Other 339 399 472 Total operating profit $ 5,723 $ 6,713 $ 6,083 29 Geographic area information The following geographic area information includes revenue, based on product shipment destination, and property, plant and equipment, based on physical location. The geographic revenue information does not necessarily reflect end demand by geography because our products tend to be shipped to the locations where our customers manufacture their products. For Years Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Revenue: United States $ 1,827 $ 2,288 $ 1,901 Asia (a) 8,650 9,240 8,824 Europe, Middle East and Africa 2,707 3,047 2,907 Japan 796 869 1,049 Rest of world 403 340 280 Total revenue $ 14,383 $ 15,784 $ 14,961 (a) Revenue from products shipped into China was $ 7.2 billion, $ 7.0 billion and $ 6.6 billion in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, which includes shipments to customers that manufacture in China and then export end products to their customers around the world, as well as distributors that transship inventory through China to service other countries. December 31, 2019 2018 Property, plant and equipment: United States $ 1,998 $ 1,812 Asia (a) 1,046 1,116 Europe, Middle East and Africa 63 84 Japan 185 157 Rest of world 11 14 Total property, plant and equipment $ 3,303 $ 3,183 (a) Property, plant and equipment at our two sites in the Philippines was $ 394 million and $ 437 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Property, plant and equipment at our sites in China was $ 304 million and $ 313 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 2. Basis of presentation and significant accounting policies and practices Basis of presentation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The basis of these financial statements is comparable for all periods presented herein, except for the effects of adopting a new accounting standard in 2019 related to leases. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. All dollar amounts in the financial statements and tables in these notes, except per-share amounts, are stated in millions of U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated. We have reclassified certain amounts in the prior periods’ financial statements to conform to the 2019 presentation. The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates from which final results may vary. 30 Significant accounting policies and practices Revenue recognition We generate revenue primarily from the sale of semiconductor products, either directly to a customer or to a distributor, or at the conclusion of a consignment process. We have a variety of types of contracts with our customers and distributors. In determining whether a contract exists, we evaluate the terms of the arrangement, the relationship with the customer or distributor and their ability to pay. We recognize revenue from sales of our products, including sales to our distributors, when control is transferred. Control is considered transferred when title and risk of loss pass, when the customer becomes obligated to pay and, where required, when the customer has accepted the products. This transfer generally occurs at a point in time upon shipment or delivery to the customer or distributor, depending upon the terms of the sales order. Payment for sales to customers and distributors is generally due on our standard commercial terms. For sales to distributors, payment is not contingent upon resale of the products. Revenue from sales of our products that are subject to inventory consignment agreements is recognized at a point in time, when the customer or distributor pulls product from consignment inventory that we store at designated locations. Delivery and transfer of control occur at that point, when title and risk of loss transfers and the customer or distributor becomes obligated to pay for the products pulled from inventory. Until the products are pulled for use or sale by the customer or distributor, we retain control over the products’ disposition, including the right to pull back or relocate the products. The revenue recognized is adjusted based on allowances, which are prepared on a portfolio basis using a most likely amount methodology based on analysis of historical data and contractual terms. These allowances, which are not material, generally include adjustments for pricing arrangements, product returns and incentives. The length of time between invoicing and payment is not significant under any of our payment terms. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. In addition, we record allowances for accounts receivable that we estimate may not be collected. We monitor collectability of accounts receivable primarily through review of accounts receivable aging. When collection is at risk, we assess the impact on amounts recorded for bad debts and, if necessary, record a charge in the period such determination is made. We recognize shipping fees, if any, received from customers in revenue. We include the related shipping and handling costs in cost of revenue. The majority of our customers pay these fees directly to third parties. Advertising costs We expense advertising and other promotional costs as incurred. This expense was $ 30 million, $ 34 million and $ 39 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Income taxes We account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach. We record the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns. We record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Other assessed taxes Some transactions require us to collect taxes such as sales, value-added and excise taxes from our customers. These transactions are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Income on a net (excluded from revenue) basis. Leases We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Leases are included in other long-term assets, accrued expenses and other liabilities, and other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Lease assets represent our right to use underlying assets for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligations to make lease payments over the lease term. On the commencement date, leases are evaluated for classification, and assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. We use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement in determining the present value of lease payments. Operating lease expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Our lease values include options to extend or not to terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options. 31 We have agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for as a single lease component. Leases with an initial lease term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; we recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Earnings per share (EPS) We use the two-class method for calculating EPS because the restricted stock units (RSUs) we grant are participating securities containing non-forfeitable rights to receive dividend equivalents. Under the two-class method, a portion of net income is allocated to RSUs and excluded from the calculation of income allocated to common stock, as shown in the table below. Computation and reconciliation of earnings per common share are as follows (shares in millions): For Years Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Net Income Shares EPS Net Income Shares EPS Net Income Shares EPS Basic EPS: Net income $ 5,017 $ 5,580 $ 3,682 Income allocated to RSUs ( 32 ) ( 43 ) ( 34 ) Income allocated to common stock $ 4,985 936 $ 5.33 $ 5,537 970 $ 5.71 $ 3,648 991 $ 3.68 Dilutive effect of stock compensation plans 16 20 21 Diluted EPS: Net income $ 5,017 $ 5,580 $ 3,682 Income allocated to RSUs ( 31 ) ( 42 ) ( 33 ) Income allocated to common stock $ 4,986 952 $ 5.24 $ 5,538 990 $ 5.59 $ 3,649 1,012 $ 3.61 Potentially dilutive securities representing 6 million, 4 million and 6 million shares of common stock that were outstanding in 2019, 2018 and 2017 respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per common share during these periods because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. Investments We present investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as cash equivalents, short-term investments or long-term investments, which are detailed below. See Note 6 for additional information. • Cash equivalents and short-term investments – We consider investments in available-for-sale debt securities with maturities of 90 days or less from the date of our investment to be cash equivalents. We consider investments in available-for-sale debt securities with maturities beyond 90 days from the date of our investment as being available for use in current operations and include them in short-term investments. The primary objectives of our cash equivalent and short-term investment activities are to preserve capital and maintain liquidity while generating appropriate returns. • Long-term investments – Long-term investments consist of mutual funds, venture capital funds and non-marketable equity securities. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. Cost is generally computed on a currently adjusted standard cost basis, which approximates cost on a first-in first-out basis. Standard cost is based on the normal utilization of installed factory capacity. Cost associated with underutilization of capacity is expensed as incurred. Inventory held at consignment locations is included in our finished goods inventory. We review inventory quarterly for salability and obsolescence. A statistical allowance is provided for inventory considered unlikely to be sold. The statistical allowance is based on an analysis of historical disposal activity, historical customer shipments, as well as estimated future sales. A specific allowance for each material type will be carried if there is a significant event not captured by the statistical allowance. We write off inventory in the period in which disposal occurs. 32 Property, plant and equipment; acquisition-related intangibles; and other capitalized costs Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Our cost basis includes certain assets acquired in business combinations that were initially recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the improvements. We amortize acquisition-related intangibles on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life of the assets. Capitalized software licenses generally are amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the license. Fully depreciated or amortized assets are written off against accumulated depreciation or amortization. Impairments of long-lived assets We regularly review whether facts or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying values of property, plant and equipment or other long-lived assets, including intangible assets, are impaired. We assess the recoverability of assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with those assets to their respective carrying amounts. Any impairment charge is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. Fair value is determined by available market valuations, if applicable, or by discounted cash flows. Goodwill Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if certain impairment indicators arise. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1 for our reporting units, which compares the fair value for each reporting unit to its associated carrying value, including goodwill. See Note 7 for additional information. Foreign currency The functional currency for our non-U.S. subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Accounts recorded in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are remeasured into the functional currency. Current assets (except inventories), deferred taxes, other assets, current liabilities and long-term liabilities are remeasured at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period. Property, plant and equipment with associated depreciation and inventories are valued at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expense accounts other than depreciation for each month are remeasured at the appropriate daily rate of exchange. Currency exchange gains and losses from remeasurement are credited or charged to OI&E. Derivatives and hedging We use derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to foreign exchange risk. These instruments are primarily forward foreign currency exchange contracts, which are used as economic hedges to reduce the earnings impact that exchange rate fluctuations may have on our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures. Gains and losses from changes in the fair value of these forward foreign currency exchange contracts are credited or charged to OI&E. We do not apply hedge accounting to our foreign currency derivative instruments. In connection with the issuance of long-term debt, we may use financial derivatives such as treasury-rate lock agreements that are recognized in AOCI and amortized over the life of the related debt. The results of these derivative transactions have not been material. We do not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. Changes in accounting standards – adopted standards for current period Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) We adopted ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (ASC 842) effective January 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective transition method applied to leases existing at, or entered into after, the adoption date. The reported results for 2019 reflect the application of the new accounting guidance, while the reported results for prior periods are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historical accounting under ASC 840, Leases. In addition, we elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance that allowed us to apply prior conclusions related to lease definition, classification and initial direct costs. The adoption of the new standard resulted in the recognition of $ 229 million of lease liabilities with corresponding lease assets as of January 1, 2019. The standard did not materially impact our results of operations and had no impact on cash flows. 33 Other standards The following standards were also adopted: ASU Description Adopted Date ASU No. 2017-12 Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities January 1, 2019 ASU No. 2018-14 Compensation – Retirement Benefits – Defined Benefit Plans – General (Subtopic 715-20): Disclosure Framework – Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans January 1, 2019 Changes in accounting standards – standards not yet adopted ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments This standard requires entities to use a current lifetime expected credit loss methodology to measure impairments of certain financial assets. Using this methodology will result in earlier recognition of losses than under the current incurred loss approach, which requires waiting to recognize a loss until it is probable of being incurred. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities will be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a reduction to the amortized cost basis of the securities. We are adopting this standard effective January 1, 2020, applying the guidance on a modified retrospective basis. In preparation for adoption of the standard, we have updated certain policies and related processes, but this standard will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Other standards We are evaluating the impact of the following standards, but we do not expect them to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. We are adopting these standards as of their effective dates. ASU Description Effective Date ASU No. 2018-13 Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework – Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement January 1, 2020 ASU No. 2018-15 Intangibles – Goodwill and Other – Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract January 1, 2020 3. Stock compensation We have stock options outstanding to participants under long-term incentive plans. The option price per share may not be less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of the grant. The options have a 10 -year term, generally vest ratably over four years , and continue to vest after the option recipient retires. We also have RSUs outstanding to participants under long-term incentive plans. Each RSU represents the right to receive one share of TI common stock, issued on the vesting date, which is generally four years after the date of grant. RSUs continue to vest after the recipient retires. Holders of RSUs receive an annual cash payment equivalent to the dividends paid on our common stock. We have options and RSUs outstanding to non-employee directors under director compensation plans. The plans generally provide for annual grants of stock options and RSUs, a one-time grant of RSUs to each new non-employee director and the issuance of TI common stock upon the distribution of stock units credited to director deferred compensation accounts. We also have an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) under which options are offered to all eligible employees in amounts based on a percentage of the employee’s compensation, subject to a cap. Under the plan, the option price per share is 85 % of the fair market value on the exercise date. 34 Total stock compensation expense recognized is as follows: For Years Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 COR $ 21 $ 25 $ 36 R&D 66 69 59 SG&A 130 138 147 Total $ 217 $ 232 $ 242 These amounts include expenses related to non-qualified stock options, RSUs and stock options offered under our ESPP and are net of estimated forfeitures. We recognize compensation expense for non-qualified stock options and RSUs on a straight-line basis over the minimum service period required for vesting of the award, adjusting for estimated forfeitures based on historical activity. Awards issued to employees who are retirement eligible or nearing retirement eligibility are expensed on an accelerated basis. Options issued under our ESPP are expensed over a three -month period. Fair-value methods and assumptions We account for all awards granted under our various stock compensation plans at fair value. We estimate the fair values for non-qualified stock options using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: For Years Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Weighted average grant date fair value, per share $ 22.08 $ 23.20 $ 16.49 Weighted average assumptions used: Expected volatility 26 % 23 % 24 % Expected lives (in years) 7.1 7.2 7.2 Risk-free interest rates 2.66 % 2.57 % 2.36 % Expected dividend yields 2.95 % 2.25 % 2.52 % We determine expected volatility on all options granted using available implied volatility rates. We believe that market-based measures of implied volatility are currently the best available indicators of the expected volatility used in these estimates. We determine expected lives of options based on the historical option exercise experience of our optionees using a rolling 10-year average. We believe the historical experience method is the best estimate of future exercise patterns currently available. Risk-free interest rates are determined using the implied yield currently available for zero-coupon U.S. government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options. Expected dividend yields are based on the annualized approved quarterly dividend rate and the current market price of our common stock at the time of grant. No assumption for a future dividend rate change is included unless there is an approved plan to change the dividend in the near term. The fair value per share of RSUs is determined based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. Our ESPP is a discount-purchase plan and consequently the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model is not used to determine the fair value per share of these awards. The fair value per share under this plan equals the amount of the discount. 35 Long-term incentive and director compensation plans Stock option and RSU transactions under our long-term incentive and director compensation plans are as follows: Stock Options RSUs Shares Weighted Average Exercise Price per Share Shares Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value per Share Outstanding grants, December 31, 2018 39,905,454 $ 56.10 7,305,543 $ 66.72 Granted 4,559,093 104.51 1,142,974 106.58 Stock options exercised/RSUs vested ( 11,529,174 ) 44.68 ( 2,370,762 ) 52.74 Forfeited and expired ( 441,429 ) 83.89 ( 179,955 ) 81.57 Outstanding grants, December 31, 2019 32,493,944 66.57 5,897,800 79.62 The weighted average grant date fair values per share of RSUs granted in 2019, 2018 and 2017 were $ 106.58 , $ 110.05 and $ 79.52 , respectively. In 2019, 2018 and 2017, the total grant date fair values of shares vested from RSU grants were $ 125 million, $ 123 million and $ 149 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, the number of shares remaining available for future issuance under these plans was 45,082,425 . Summarized information about stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2019, is as follows: Stock Options Outstanding Options Exercisable Exercise Price Range Number Outstanding (Shares) Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Life (Years) Weighted Average Exercise Price per Share Number Exercisable (Shares) Weighted Average Exercise Price per Share $ 23.05 to 127.35 32,493,944 5.9 $ 66.57 19,646,782 $ 50.82 In 2019, 2018 and 2017, the aggregate intrinsic values (i.e., the difference in the closing market price on the date of exercise and the exercise price paid by the optionee) of options exercised were $ 819 million, $ 561 million and $ 632 million, respectively. Summarized information as of December 31, 2019, about outstanding stock options that are vested and expected to vest, as well as stock options that are currently exercisable, is as follows: Outstanding Stock Options (Fully Vested and Expected to Vest) (a) Options Exercisable Number of outstanding (shares) 32,001,396 19,646,782 Weighted average remaining contractual life (in years) 5.8 4.6 Weighted average exercise price per share $ 66.03 $ 50.82 Intrinsic value (millions of dollars) $ 1,992 $ 1,522 (a) Includes effects of expected forfeitures. Excluding the effects of expected forfeitures, the aggregate intrinsic value of stock options outstanding was $ 2.01 billion. As of December 31, 2019, total future compensation related to equity awards not yet recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Income was $ 226 million, consisting of $ 98 million related to unvested stock options and $ 128 million related to unvested RSUs. The $ 226 million is expected to be recognized as follows: $ 113 million in 2020, $ 72 million in 2021, $ 37 million in 2022 and $ 4 million in 2023. 36 Employee stock purchase plan Options outstanding under the ESPP as of December 31, 2019, had an exercise price equal to 85 % of the fair market value of TI common stock on the date of automatic exercise. The automatic exercise occurred on January 2, 2020, resulting in an exercise price of $ 110.14 per share. Of the total outstanding options, none were exercisable as of December 31, 2019. ESPP transactions are as follows: Shares Exercise Price Outstanding grants, December 31, 2018 229,836 $ 80.29 Granted 742,819 102.34 Exercised ( 798,806 ) 94.30 Outstanding grants, December 31, 2019 173,849 110.14 The weighted average grant date fair values per share of options granted under the ESPP in 2019, 2018 and 2017 were $ 18.05 , $ 15.43 and $ 12.99 , respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised under these plans was $ 13 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017. As of December 31, 2019, the number of shares remaining available for future issuance under this plan was 33,812,282 . Effect on shares outstanding and treasury shares Treasury shares were acquired in connection with the board-authorized stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2019, $ 13.18 billion of stock repurchase authorizations remain, and no expiration date has been specified. 37 Our current practice is to issue shares of common stock from treasury shares upon exercise of stock options, distribution of director deferred compensation and vesting of RSUs. The following table reflects the changes in our treasury shares: Stock Options RSUs Treasury Shares Balance, December 31, 2016 744,831,978 Repurchases 30,570,129 Shares used for: Stock options/RSUs ( 13,313,019 ) ( 4,419,464 ) Stock applied to taxes — 1,058,100 ESPP ( 1,065,757 ) — Director deferred stock units — — ( 4,750 ) Total issued ( 14,378,776 ) ( 3,361,364 ) ( 17,740,140 ) Balance, December 31, 2017 757,657,217 Repurchases 49,482,220 Shares used for: Stock options/RSUs ( 8,432,458 ) ( 2,769,994 ) Stock applied to taxes — 553,720 ESPP ( 819,878 ) — Director deferred stock units — — ( 5,181 ) Total issued ( 9,252,336 ) ( 2,216,274 ) ( 11,468,610 ) Balance, December 31, 2018 795,665,646 Repurchases 27,398,701 Shares used for: Stock options/RSUs ( 11,529,174 ) ( 2,370,762 ) Stock applied to taxes — 490,347 ESPP ( 798,806 ) — Director deferred stock units — — ( 71,571 ) Total issued ( 12,327,980 ) ( 1,880,415 ) ( 14,208,395 ) Balance, December 31, 2019 808,784,381 The effects on cash flows are as follows: For Years Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Proceeds from common stock transactions (a) $ 539 $ 373 $ 483 Tax benefit realized from stock compensation $ 224 $ 179 $ 341 Reduction to deferred tax asset ( 49 ) ( 43 ) ( 91 ) Excess tax benefit for stock compensation $ 175 $ 136 $ 250 (a) Net of taxes paid for employee shares withheld of $ 52 million, $ 60 million and $ 83 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 38 4. Income taxes Income before income taxes is comprised of the following components: For Years Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 U.S. $ 4,915 $ 5,672 $ 5,130 Non-U.S. 813 1,014 950 Total $ 5,728 $ 6,686 $ 6,080 Provision for income taxes is comprised of the following components: For Years Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Current Deferred Total Current Deferred Total Current Deferred Total U.S. federal $ 483 $ 25 $ 508 $ 979 $ ( 98 ) $ 881 $ 2,101 $ 51 $ 2,152 Non-U.S. 135 56 191 225 ( 8 ) 217 173 61 234 U.S. state 12 — 12 7 1 8 12 — 12 Total $ 630 $ 81 $ 711 $ 1,211 $ ( 105 ) $ 1,106 $ 2,286 $ 112 $ 2,398 Principal reconciling items from the U.S. statutory income tax rate to the effective tax rate (provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes) are as follows: For Years Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 U.S. statutory income tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 35.0 % U.S. tax benefit for foreign derived intangible income ( 4.9 ) ( 5.3 ) — U.S. excess tax benefit for stock compensation ( 3.1 ) ( 2.0 ) ( 4.1 ) U.S. R&D tax credit ( 1.4 ) ( 1.3 ) ( 1.1 ) Non-U.S. effective tax rates 0.3 0.1 ( 2.5 ) U.S. Tax Act transitional non-cash expense — 4.2 — U.S. Tax Act enactment-date effects and measurement period adjustments — ( 0.7 ) 12.7 U.S. tax benefit for manufacturing — — ( 1.6 ) Other 0.5 0.5 1.0 Effective tax rate 12.4 % 16.5 % 39.4 % The U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act reduces the U.S. statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21% and requires companies to pay a one-time tax on indefinitely reinvested earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred. We applied the guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 when accounting for the enactment-date effects of the Tax Act in 2017 and throughout 2018. As of December 31, 2018, we completed our accounting for the enactment-date income tax effects of the Tax Act. We booked a provisional amount of $ 773 million in 2017 and reduced our provisional amount by $ 44 million in 2018, for a net of $ 729 million. The earnings represented by non-cash operating assets, such as fixed assets and inventory, will continue to be permanently reinvested outside the United States. Provisions of the Tax Act, such as the one-time tax on indefinitely reinvested earnings and the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) tax for years beginning in 2018, eliminate any additional U.S. taxation resulting from repatriation of earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries to the United States. Consequently, no U.S. tax provision has been made for the future remittance of these earnings. However, withholding or distribution taxes in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions will be incurred upon repatriation of available cash to the United States. A provision has been made for deferred taxes on these undistributed earnings to the extent that repatriation of the available cash to the United States is expected to result in a tax liability. As of December 31, 2019, we have no basis differences that would result in material unrecognized deferred tax liabilities. 39 We have made an allowable policy election to account for the effects of GILTI as a component of income tax expense in the period in which the tax is incurred. The primary components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows: December 31, 2019 2018 Deferred tax assets: Deferred loss and tax credit carryforwards $ 213 $ 247 Accrued expenses 113 129 Stock compensation 109 122 Inventories and related reserves 109 107 Retirement costs for defined benefit and retiree health care 49 80 Total deferred tax assets, before valuation allowance 593 685 Valuation allowance ( 180 ) ( 172 ) Total deferred tax assets, after valuation allowance 413 513 Deferred tax liabilities: Property, plant and equipment ( 95 ) ( 10 ) Acquisition-related intangibles and fair-value adjustments ( 82 ) ( 142 ) International earnings ( 62 ) ( 43 ) Other ( 55 ) ( 65 ) Total deferred tax liabilities ( 294 ) ( 260 ) Net deferred tax asset $ 119 $ 253 The deferred tax assets and liabilities based on tax jurisdictions are presented on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows: December 31, 2019 2018 Deferred tax assets $ 197 $ 295 Deferred tax liabilities ( 78 ) ( 42 ) Net deferred tax asset $ 119 $ 253 We make an ongoing assessment regarding the realization of U.S. and non-U.S. deferred tax assets. This assessment is based on our evaluation of relevant criteria, including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets, taxable income in prior carryback years and expectations for future taxable income. Valuation allowances increased by $ 8 million, $ 7 million and $ 37 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These changes had no impact to net income in 2019 or 2018. We have U.S. and non-U.S. tax loss carryforwards of approximately $ 6 million, none of which will expire before the year 2029. Cash payments made for income taxes, net of refunds, were $ 570 million, $ 705 million and $ 1.80 billion in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Uncertain tax positions We operate in a number of tax jurisdictions, and our income tax returns are subject to examination by tax authorities in those jurisdictions who may challenge any item on these tax returns. Because the matters challenged by authorities are typically complex, their ultimate outcome is uncertain. Before any benefit can be recorded in our financial statements, we must determine that it is “more likely than not” that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate tax authorities. We recognize accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions and penalties as components of OI&E. 40 The changes in the total amounts of uncertain tax positions are as follows: 2019 2018 2017 Balance, January 1 $ 286 $ 300 $ 243 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 3 3 17 Additions for tax positions of prior years 63 1 42 Reductions for tax positions of prior years ( 41 ) — ( 1 ) Settlements with tax authorities ( 8 ) ( 18 ) ( 1 ) Balance, December 31 $ 303 $ 286 $ 300 Interest income (expense) recognized in the year ended December 31 $ 9 $ ( 15 ) $ ( 19 ) Interest payable as of December 31 $ 44 $ 49 $ 38 The liability for uncertain tax positions is a component of other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. All of the $ 303 million and $ 286 million liabilities for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, are comprised of positions that, if recognized, would lower the effective tax rate. If these liabilities are ultimately realized, $ 2 million and $ 30 million of existing deferred tax assets in 2019 and 2018, respectively, would also be realized. It is reasonably possible that the $ 303 million liability as of December 31, 2019, could decrease by up to $ 249 million in 2020 for the resolution of a tax depreciation-related position. As of December 31, 2019, the statute of limitations remains open for U.S. federal tax returns for 2013 and following years. Audit activities related to our U.S. federal tax returns through 2012 have been completed except for certain pending tax treaty procedures for relief from double taxation. The procedures for relief from double taxation pertain to U.S. federal tax returns for the years 2007 through 2012. The audit of the U.S. federal tax returns for 2013 through 2015 is underway. In non-U.S. jurisdictions, the years open to audit represent the years still open under the statute of limitations. With respect to major jurisdictions outside the United States, our subsidiaries are no longer subject to income tax audits for years before 2007. 5. Financial instruments and risk concentration Financial instruments We hold derivative financial instruments such as forward foreign currency exchange contracts, the fair value of which was not material as of December 31, 2019. Our forward foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2019, had a notional value of $ 458 million to hedge our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures, including $ 136 million to sell Japanese yen, $ 106 million to sell Indian rupees and $ 74 million to sell British pounds. Our investments in cash equivalents, short-term investments and certain long-term investments, as well as our deferred compensation liabilities, are carried at fair value. Our postretirement plan assets are carried at fair value or net asset value per share. The carrying values for other current financial assets and liabilities, such as accounts receivable and accounts payable, approximate fair value due to the short maturity of such instruments. As of December 31, 2019, the carrying value of long-term debt, including the current portion, was $ 5.80 billion, and the estimated fair value was $ 6.29 billion. The estimated fair value is measured using broker-dealer quotes, which are Level 2 inputs. See Note 6 for a description of fair value and the definition of Level 2 inputs. Risk concentration We are subject to counterparty risks from financial institutions, customers and issuers of debt securities. Financial instruments that could subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash deposits, cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable. To manage our credit risk exposure, we place cash investments in investment-grade debt securities and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. We also limit counterparties on cash deposits and financial derivative contracts to financial institutions with investment-grade ratings. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across different industries and geographic areas. We maintain allowances for expected returns, disputes, adjustments, incentives and collectability. These allowances are deducted from accounts receivable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 41 Accounts receivable allowances changed to reflect amounts charged (credited) to operating results by ($ 11 ) million, $ 11 million and ($ 9 ) million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Major customer No end customer accounted for 10% or more of revenue in 2019, 2018 or 2017. 6. Valuation of debt and equity investments and certain liabilities Debt and equity investments measured at fair value Available-for-sale debt investments and trading securities are stated at fair value, which is generally based on market prices or broker quotes. See Fair-value considerations below. Unrealized gains and losses from available-for-sale debt securities are recorded as an increase or decrease, net of taxes, in AOCI on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Other-than-temporary impairments on available-for-sale debt securities are recorded in OI&E in our Consolidated Statements of Income. We classify certain mutual funds as trading securities. These mutual funds hold a variety of debt and equity investments intended to generate returns that offset changes in certain deferred compensation liabilities. We record changes in the fair value of these mutual funds and the related deferred compensation liabilities in SG&A. Other equity investments Our other investments include equity-method investments and non-marketable equity investments, which are not measured at fair value. These investments consist of interests in venture capital funds and other non-marketable equity securities. Gains and losses from equity-method investments are recognized in OI&E based on our ownership share of the investee’s financial results. Non-marketable equity securities are measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments. Gains and losses on non-marketable equity investments are recognized in OI&E. Details of our investments are as follows: December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Cash and Cash Equivalents Short-Term Investments Long-Term Investments Cash and Cash Equivalents Short-Term Investments Long-Term Investments Measured at fair value: Available-for-sale debt securities: Money market funds $ 1,213 $ — $ — $ 747 $ — $ — Corporate obligations 174 1,216 — 473 748 — U.S. government agency and Treasury securities 604 1,734 — 988 1,047 — Trading securities: Mutual funds — — 272 — — 226 Total 1,991 2,950 272 2,208 1,795 226 Other measurement basis: Equity-method investments — — 24 — — 21 Non-marketable equity investments — — 4 — — 4 Cash on hand 446 — — 230 — — Total $ 2,437 $ 2,950 $ 300 $ 2,438 $ 1,795 $ 251 As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, unrealized gains and losses associated with our available-for-sale investments were not material. We did no t recognize any credit losses related to available-for-sale investments in 2019, 2018 or 2017. 42 In 2019, 2018 and 2017, the proceeds from sales, redemptions and maturities of short-term available-for-sale investments were $ 2.31 billion, $ 6.71 billion and $ 4.10 billion, respectively. Gross realized gains and losses from these sales were not material. The following table presents the aggregate maturities of our available-for-sale debt investments as of December 31, 2019: Fair Value One year or less $ 4,921 One to two years 20 There were no other-than-temporary declines and impairments in the values of our debt investments in 2019, 2018 or 2017. In 2019, 2018 and 2017, net gains and losses associated with our equity investments were $ 32 million, $ 5 million and $ 4 million, respectively. These amounts include realized gains of $ 29 million, $ 11 million and $ 6 million on equity investments sold during 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Fair-value considerations We measure and report certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The three-level hierarchy described below indicates the extent and level of judgment used to estimate fair-value measurements. • Level 1 – Uses unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. • Level 2 – Uses inputs other than Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date through correlation with market data, including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and quoted prices in markets that are not active. Level 2 also includes assets and liabilities that are valued using models or other pricing methodologies that do not require significant judgment since the input assumptions used in the models, such as interest rates and volatility factors, are corroborated by readily observable data. We utilize a third-party data service to provide Level 2 valuations. We verify these valuations for reasonableness relative to unadjusted quotes obtained from brokers or dealers based on observable prices for similar assets in active markets. • Level 3 – Uses inputs that are unobservable, supported by little or no market activity and reflect the use of significant management judgment. These values are generally determined using pricing models that utilize management estimates of market participant assumptions. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had no Level 3 assets or liabilities. The following are our assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis. These tables do not include cash on hand, assets held by our postretirement plans, or assets and liabilities that are measured at historical cost or any basis other than fair value. December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Level 1 Level 2 Total Level 1 Level 2 Total Assets: Money market funds $ 1,213 $ — $ 1,213 $ 747 $ — $ 747 Corporate obligations — 1,390 1,390 — 1,221 1,221 U.S. government agency and Treasury securities 2,338 — 2,338 2,035 — 2,035 Mutual funds 272 — 272 226 — 226 Total assets $ 3,823 $ 1,390 $ 5,213 $ 3,008 $ 1,221 $ 4,229 Liabilities: Deferred compensation $ 298 $ — $ 298 $ 246 $ — $ 246 Total liabilities $ 298 $ — $ 298 $ 246 $ — $ 246 43 7. Goodwill and acquisition-related intangibles Goodwill by segment as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, is as follows: Goodwill Analog $ 4,158 Embedded Processing 172 Other 32 Total $ 4,362 We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1 and determine whether the fair value of each of our reporting units is in excess of its carrying value. Determination of fair value is based upon management estimates and judgment, using unobservable inputs in discounted cash flow models to calculate the fair value of each reporting unit. These unobservable inputs are considered Level 3 measurements, as described in Note 6. In 2019, 2018 and 2017, we determined no impairment was indicated. The components of acquisition-related intangibles are as follows: December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Amortization Period (Years) Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Developed technology 7 – 10 $ 2,000 $ 1,660 $ 340 $ 2,125 $ 1,573 $ 552 Customer relationships 8 — — — 810 734 76 Total $ 2,000 $ 1,660 $ 340 $ 2,935 $ 2,307 $ 628 Acquisition charges Acquisition charges represent the ongoing amortization of intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of National Semiconductor Corporation. These amounts are included in Other for segment reporting purposes, consistent with how management measures the performance of its segments. Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles was $ 288 million in 2019 and $ 318 million in 2018 and 2017. Fully amortized assets are written off against accumulated amortization. The remaining estimated amortization is $ 198 million in 2020 and $ 142 million in 2021. 8. Postretirement benefit plans Plan descriptions We have various employee retirement plans, including defined contribution, defined benefit and retiree health care benefit plans. For qualifying employees, we offer deferred compensation arrangements. U.S. retirement plans Our principal retirement plans in the United States are a defined contribution plan; an enhanced defined contribution plan; and qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans. The defined benefit plans were closed to new participants in 1997, and then current participants were allowed to make a one-time election to continue accruing a benefit in the plans or to cease accruing a benefit and instead to participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan described below. Both defined contribution plans offer an employer-matching savings option that allows employees to make pretax and post-tax contributions to various investment choices. Employees who elected to continue accruing a benefit in the qualified defined benefit pension plans may also participate in the defined contribution plan, where employer-matching contributions are provided for up to 2 % of the employee’s annual eligible earnings. Employees who elected not to continue accruing a benefit in the defined benefit pension plans, and employees hired after November 1997 and through December 31, 2003, may participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan. This plan provides for a fixed employer contribution of 2 % of the employee’s annual eligible earnings, plus an employer-matching contribution of up to 4 % of the employee’s annual eligible earnings. Employees hired after December 31, 2003, do not receive the fixed employer contribution of 2 % of the employee’s annual eligible earnings. 44 As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, as a result of employees’ elections, TI’s U.S. defined contribution plans held shares of TI common stock totaling 8 million shares and 9 million shares valued at $ 988 million and $ 821 million, respectively. Dividends paid on these shares in 2019 and 2018 were $ 26 million and $ 24 million, respectively. Effective April 1, 2016, the TI common stock fund was frozen to new contributions or transfers into the fund. Our aggregate expense for the U.S. defined contribution plans was $ 61 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017. The defined benefit pension plans include employees still accruing benefits, as well as employees and participants who no longer accrue service-related benefits, but instead, may participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan. Benefits under the qualified defined benefit pension plan are determined using a formula based on years of service and the highest five consecutive years of compensation. We intend to contribute amounts to this plan to meet the minimum funding requirements of applicable local laws and regulations, plus such additional amounts as we deem appropriate. The non-qualified defined benefit plans are unfunded and closed to new participants. U.S. retiree health care benefit plan U.S. employees who meet eligibility requirements are offered medical coverage during retirement. We make a contribution toward the cost of those retiree medical benefits for certain retirees and their dependents. The contribution rates are based upon various factors, the most important of which are an employee’s date of hire, date of retirement, years of service and eligibility for Medicare benefits. The balance of the cost is borne by the plan’s participants. Employees hired after January 1, 2001, are responsible for the full cost of their medical benefits during retirement. Non-U.S. retirement plans We provide retirement coverage for non-U.S. employees, as required by local laws or to the extent we deem appropriate, through a number of defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Retirement benefits are generally based on an employee’s years of service and compensation. Funding requirements are determined on an individual country and plan basis and are subject to local country practices and market circumstances. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, as a result of employees’ elections, TI’s non-U.S. defined contribution plans held TI common stock valued at $ 28 million and $ 23 million, respectively. Dividends paid on these shares of TI common stock in 2019 and 2018 were not material. Effects on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Balance Sheets Expense related to defined benefit and retiree health care benefit plans is as follows: U.S. Defined Benefit U.S. Retiree Health Care Non-U.S. Defined Benefit 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 2017 Service cost $ 18 $ 19 $ 22 $ 3 $ 5 $ 5 $ 31 $ 36 $ 37 Interest cost 38 35 42 14 15 17 43 45 44 Expected return on plan assets ( 41 ) ( 42 ) ( 41 ) ( 14 ) ( 15 ) ( 17 ) ( 86 ) ( 67 ) ( 62 ) Amortization of prior service cost (credit) — — — ( 1 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) 1 ( 1 ) ( 2 ) Recognized net actuarial loss 9 17 14 — 2 3 29 20 28 Net periodic benefit costs 24 29 37 2 4 4 18 33 45 Settlement losses 10 23 36 — — — 3 3 2 Total, including other postretirement losses $ 34 $ 52 $ 73 $ 2 $ 4 $ 4 $ 21 $ 36 $ 47 All defined benefit and retiree health care benefit plan expense components other than service cost are recognized in OI&E in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Service cost is recognized within operating profit. For the U.S. qualified pension and retiree health care plans, the expected return on plan assets component of net periodic benefit cost is based upon a market-related value of assets. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the market-related value of assets is the fair value adjusted by a smoothing technique whereby certain gains and losses are phased in over a period of three years . 45 Changes in the benefit obligations and plan assets for defined benefit and retiree health care benefit plans are as follows: U.S. Defined Benefit U.S. Retiree Health Care Non-U.S. Defined Benefit 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 Change in plan benefit obligation Benefit obligation at beginning of year: $ 874 $ 998 $ 361 $ 414 $ 2,411 $ 2,469 Service cost 18 19 3 5 31 36 Interest cost 38 35 14 15 43 45 Participant contributions — — 13 11 7 7 Benefits paid ( 11 ) ( 10 ) ( 41 ) ( 41 ) ( 103 ) ( 87 ) Settlements ( 66 ) ( 100 ) — — ( 12 ) ( 16 ) Curtailments — — — — ( 1 ) — Actuarial loss (gain) 107 ( 68 ) 9 ( 43 ) 193 6 Plan amendments — — — — — 7 Effects of exchange rate changes — — — — 12 ( 56 ) Benefit obligation at end of year $ 960 $ 874 $ 359 $ 361 $ 2,581 $ 2,411 Change in plan assets Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year: $ 869 $ 995 $ 330 $ 394 $ 2,410 $ 2,593 Actual return on plan assets 185 ( 56 ) 53 ( 12 ) 337 ( 52 ) Employer contributions (qualified plans) — 20 1 1 9 19 Employer contributions (non-qualified plans) 10 20 — — — — Participant contributions — — 13 11 7 7 Benefits paid ( 11 ) ( 10 ) ( 41 ) ( 41 ) ( 103 ) ( 87 ) Settlements ( 66 ) ( 100 ) — — ( 12 ) ( 16 ) Effects of exchange rate changes — — — — 13 ( 54 ) Other — — — ( 23 ) — — Fair value of plan assets at end of year $ 987 $ 869 $ 356 $ 330 $ 2,661 $ 2,410 Funded status at end of year $ 27 $ ( 5 ) $ ( 3 ) $ ( 31 ) $ 80 $ ( 1 ) The actuarial loss (gain) for all pension plans was primarily related to a change in the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations of those plans in 2019 and 2018. Amounts recognized on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, are as follows: U.S. Defined Benefit U.S. Retiree Health Care Non-U.S. Defined Benefit Total 2019 Overfunded retirement plans $ 73 $ — $ 145 $ 218 Accrued expenses and other liabilities & other long-term liabilities ( 17 ) — ( 4 ) ( 21 ) Underfunded retirement plans ( 29 ) ( 3 ) ( 61 ) ( 93 ) Funded status at end of 2019 $ 27 $ ( 3 ) $ 80 $ 104 2018 Overfunded retirement plans $ 40 $ — $ 52 $ 92 Accrued expenses and other liabilities & other long-term liabilities ( 8 ) — ( 3 ) ( 11 ) Underfunded retirement plans ( 37 ) ( 31 ) ( 50 ) ( 118 ) Funded status at end of 2018 $ ( 5 ) $ ( 31 ) $ ( 1 ) $ ( 37 ) 46 Contributions to the plans meet or exceed all minimum funding requirements. We expect to contribute about $ 20 million to our retirement benefit plans in 2020. Accumulated benefit obligations, which are generally less than the projected benefit obligations as they exclude the impact of future salary increases, were $ 878 million and $ 793 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, for the U.S. defined benefit plans, and $ 2.46 billion and $ 2.29 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, for the non-U.S. defined benefit plans.

The tables below set forth the fair value of our plan assets using the same three-level hierarchy of fair-value inputs described in Note 6. December 31, 2019 Level 1 Level 2 Other (a) Total Assets of U.S. defined benefit plan: Fixed income securities and cash equivalents $ — $ — $ 640 $ 640 Equity securities — — 347 347 Total $ — $ — $ 987 $ 987 Assets of U.S. retiree health care plan: Fixed income securities and cash equivalents $ 62 $ — $ 168 $ 230 Equity securities — — 126 126 Total $ 62 $ — $ 294 $ 356 Assets of non-U.S. defined benefit plans: Fixed income securities and cash equivalents $ 59 $ 126 $ 1,762 $ 1,947 Equity securities 41 2 671 714 Total $ 100 $ 128 $ 2,433 $ 2,661 (a) Consists of bond index and equity index funds, measured at net asset value per share, as well as cash equivalents. 47 December 31, 2018 Level 1 Level 2 Other (a) Total Assets of U.S. defined benefit plan: Fixed income securities and cash equivalents $ — $ — $ 563 $ 563 Equity securities — — 306 306 Total $ — $ — $ 869 $ 869 Assets of U.S. retiree health care plan: Fixed income securities and cash equivalents $ 59 $ — $ 155 $ 214 Equity securities — — 116 116 Total $ 59 $ — $ 271 $ 330 Assets of non-U.S. defined benefit plans: Fixed income securities and cash equivalents $ 47 $ 139 $ 1,602 $ 1,788 Equity securities 33 1 588 622 Total $ 80 $ 140 $ 2,190 $ 2,410 (a) Consists of bond index and equity index funds, measured at net asset value per share, as well as cash equivalents. The investments in our major benefit plans largely consist of low-cost, broad-market index funds to mitigate risks of concentration within market sectors. Our investment policy is designed to better match the interest rate sensitivity of the plan assets and liabilities. The appropriate mix of equity and bond investments is determined primarily through the use of detailed asset-liability modeling studies that look to balance the impact of changes in the discount rate against the need to provide asset growth to cover future service cost. Most of our plans around the world have a greater proportion of fixed income securities with return characteristics that are more closely aligned with changes in the liabilities caused by discount rate volatility. Assumptions and investment policies U.S. Defined Benefit U.S. Retiree Health Care Non-U.S. Defined Benefit 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 Weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations: Discount rate 3.62 % 4.37 % 3.63 % 4.30 % 1.46 % 1.85 % Long-term pay progression 3.30 % 3.30 % n/a n/a 3.06 % 2.96 % Weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost: Discount rate 4.35 % 3.77 % 4.30 % 3.63 % 1.85 % 1.84 % Long-term rate of return on plan assets 4.90 % 4.80 % 4.40 % 4.10 % 3.62 % 2.58 % Long-term pay progression 3.30 % 3.30 % n/a n/a 3.03 % 2.96 % We utilize a variety of methods to select an appropriate discount rate depending on the depth of the corporate bond market in the country in which the benefit plan operates. In the United States, we use a settlement approach whereby a portfolio of bonds is selected from the universe of actively traded high-quality U.S. corporate bonds. The selected portfolio is designed to provide cash flows sufficient to pay the plan’s expected benefit payments when due. The resulting discount rate reflects the rate of return of the selected portfolio of bonds. For our non-U.S. locations with a sufficient number of actively traded high-quality bonds, an analysis is performed in which the projected cash flows from the defined benefit plans are discounted against a yield curve constructed with an appropriate universe of high-quality corporate bonds available in each country. In this manner, a present value is developed. The discount rate selected is the single equivalent rate that produces the same present value. For countries that lack a sufficient corporate bond market, a government bond index adjusted for an appropriate risk premium is used to establish the discount rate. 48 Assumptions for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets are based on future expectations for returns for each asset class and the effect of periodic target asset allocation rebalancing. We adjust the results for the payment of reasonable expenses of the plan from plan assets. We believe our assumptions are appropriate based on the investment mix and long-term nature of the plans’ investments. Assumptions used for the non-U.S. defined benefit plans reflect the different economic environments within the various countries. The target allocation ranges for the plans that hold a substantial majority of the defined benefit assets are as follows: U.S. Defined Benefit U.S. Retiree Health Care Non-U.S. Defined Benefit Fixed income securities and cash equivalents 65 % 65 % 60 % – 100 % Equity securities 35 % 35 % 0 % – 40 % We rebalance the plans’ investments when they are outside the target allocation ranges. Weighted average asset allocations as of December 31 are as follows: U.S. Defined Benefit U.S. Retiree Health Care Non-U.S. Defined Benefit 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 Fixed income securities and cash equivalents 65 % 65 % 65 % 65 % 73 % 74 % Equity securities 35 % 35 % 35 % 35 % 27 % 26 % None of the plan assets related to the defined benefit pension plans and retiree health care benefit plan are directly invested in TI common stock. The following assumed future benefit payments to plan participants in the next 10 years are used to measure our benefit obligations. Almost all of the payments, which may vary significantly from these assumptions, will be made from plan assets and not from company assets. 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 – 2029 U.S. Defined Benefit $ 99 $ 118 $ 85 $ 90 $ 87 $ 441 U.S. Retiree Health Care 32 30 29 27 26 115 Non-U.S. Defined Benefit 95 96 99 100 104 542 Assumed health care cost trend rates for the U.S. retiree health care benefit plan as of December 31 are as follows: 2019 2018 Assumed health care cost trend rate for next year 7.00 % 7.25 % Ultimate trend rate 5.00 % 5.00 % Year in which ultimate trend rate is reached 2028 2028 Deferred compensation plans We have deferred compensation plans that allow U.S. employees whose base salary and management responsibility exceed a certain level to defer receipt of a portion of their cash compensation. Payments under these plans are made based on the participant’s distribution election and plan balance. Participants can earn a return on their deferred compensation based on notional investments in the same investment funds that are offered in our defined contribution plans. As of December 31, 2019, our liability to participants of the deferred compensation plans was $ 298 million and is recorded in other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. This amount reflects the accumulated participant deferrals and earnings thereon as of that date. As of December 31, 2019, we held $ 272 million in mutual funds related to these plans that are recorded in long-term investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and serve as an economic hedge against changes in fair values of our other deferred compensation liabilities. We record changes in the fair value of the liability and the related investment in SG&A as discussed in Note 6. 49 9. Debt and lines of credit Short-term borrowings We maintain a line of credit to support commercial paper borrowings, if any, and to provide additional liquidity through bank loans. As of December 31, 2019, we had a variable-rate revolving credit facility from a consortium of investment-grade banks that allows us to borrow up to $ 2 billion until March 2024. The interest rate on borrowings under this credit facility, if drawn, is indexed to the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). As of December 31, 2019, our credit facility was undrawn, and we had no commercial paper outstanding. Long-term debt We retired $ 750 million of maturing debt in August 2019. In March 2019, we issued a principal amount of $ 750 million of fixed-rate, long-term debt due in 2039. We incurred $ 7 million of issuance and other related costs. The proceeds of the offering were $ 743 million, net of the original issuance discount, and were used for general corporate purposes. In September 2019, we issued a principal amount of $ 750 million of fixed-rate, long-term debt due in 2029. We incurred $ 5 million of issuance and other related costs. The proceeds of the offering were $ 748 million, net of the original issuance discount, and were used for general corporate purposes. We retired $ 500 million of maturing debt in May 2018. In the second quarter of 2018, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $ 1.5 billion of fixed-rate, long-term debt due in 2048, comprised of the issuance of $ 1.3 billion in May 2018 and an additional $ 200 million in June 2018. We incurred $ 16 million of issuance and other related costs. The proceeds of the offering were $ 1.5 billion, net of the original issuance discount and premium, and were used for general corporate purposes. We retired $ 250 million of maturing debt in March 2017 and another $ 375 million in June 2017. In May 2017, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $ 600 million of fixed-rate, long-term debt. The offering consisted of the reissuance of $ 300 million of 2.75 % notes due in 2021 at a premium and the issuance of $ 300 million of 2.625 % notes due in 2024 at a discount. We incurred $ 3 million of issuance and other related costs. The proceeds of the offerings were $ 605 million, net of the original issuance discount and premium, and were used for the repayment of maturing debt and general corporate purposes. In November 2017, we issued a principal amount of $ 500 million of fixed-rate, long-term debt due in 2027. We incurred $ 3 million of issuance and other related costs. The proceeds of the offering were $ 494 million, net of the original issuance discount, and were used for general corporate purposes. 50 Long-term debt outstanding is as follows: December 31, 2019 2018 Notes due 2019 at 1.65 % $ — $ 750 Notes due 2020 at 1.75 % 500 500 Notes due 2021 at 2.75 % 550 550 Notes due 2022 at 1.85 % 500 500 Notes due 2023 at 2.25 % 500 500 Notes due 2024 at 2.625 % 300 300 Notes due 2027 at 2.90 % 500 500 Notes due 2029 at 2.25 % 750 — Notes due 2039 at 3.875 % 750 — Notes due 2048 at 4.15 % 1,500 1,500 Total debt 5,850 5,100 Net unamortized discounts, premiums and issuance costs ( 47 ) ( 32 ) Total debt, including net unamortized discounts, premiums and issuance costs 5,803 5,068 Current portion of long-term debt ( 500 ) ( 749 ) Long-term debt $ 5,303 $ 4,319 Interest and debt expense was $ 170 million, $ 125 million and $ 78 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. This was net of the amortized discounts, premiums and issuance costs. Cash payments for interest on long-term debt were $ 156 million, $ 114 million and $ 75 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Capitalized interest was not material. 10. Leases We conduct certain operations in leased facilities and also lease a portion of our data processing and other equipment. In addition, certain long-term supply agreements to purchase industrial gases are accounted for as operating leases. Lease agreements frequently include renewal provisions and require us to pay real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs. Our leases are included as a component of the following balance sheet lines: December 31, 2019 Other long-term assets $ 337 Accrued expenses and other liabilities $ 73 Other long-term liabilities 259 Details of our operating leases are as follows: For Year Ended December 31, 2019 Lease cost related to lease liabilities $ 66 Variable lease cost 41 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities: Operating cash flows for lease cost $ 60 Lease assets obtained in exchange for new lease liabilities $ 167 Weighted average remaining lease term 8.2 years Weighted average discount rate 3.37 % 51 As of December 31, 2019, we had committed to make the following minimum payments under our non-cancellable operating leases: 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Thereafter Total Lease payments $ 75 $ 63 $ 51 $ 38 $ 28 $ 131 $ 386 Imputed lease interest ( 54 ) Total lease liabilities $ 332 As of December 31, 2018, we had committed to make the following minimum payments under our non-cancellable operating leases, as reported under ASC 840: 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Thereafter Total Operating leases $ 56 $ 46 $ 36 $ 29 $ 18 $ 39 $ 224 11. Commitments and contingencies Purchase commitments Our purchase commitments include payments for software licenses and contractual arrangements with suppliers when there is a fixed, non-cancellable payment schedule or when minimum payments are due with a reduced delivery schedule. As of December 31, 2019, we had committed to make the following minimum payments under our purchase commitments: 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Thereafter Total Purchase commitments $ 452 $ 286 $ 121 $ 70 $ 27 $ 109 $ 1,065 Indemnification guarantees We routinely sell products with an intellectual property indemnification included in the terms of sale. Historically, we have had only minimal, infrequent losses associated with these indemnities. Consequently, we cannot reasonably estimate any future liabilities that may result. Warranty costs/product liabilities We accrue for known product-related claims if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. During the periods presented, there have been no material accruals or payments regarding product warranty or product liability. Historically, we have experienced a low rate of payments on product claims. Although we cannot predict the likelihood or amount of any future claims, we do not believe they will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Our stated warranties for semiconductor products obligate us to repair, replace or credit the purchase price of a covered product back to the buyer. Product claim consideration may exceed the price of our products. General We are subject to various legal and administrative proceedings. Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of these matters, we believe that the results of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 52 12.

In April 2019, we sold our manufacturing facility in Greenock, Scotland. In January 2020, we announced a multiyear plan to close our two remaining factories with 150-millimeter production, which are more than 50 years old and located in Sherman and Dallas, Texas. Production will be transitioned from these sites to our more advanced and cost-effective 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facilities in North Texas. We expect this transition to be completed in the next three to five years . Charges for these closures cannot be reasonably estimated until a later phase of the transition.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 20, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical a udit matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates. 56 Uncertain tax positions Description of the matter As discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company operates in the United States and multiple international tax jurisdictions, and its income tax returns are subject to examination by tax authorities in those jurisdictions who may challenge any tax position on these returns. Uncertainty in a tax position may arise because tax laws are subject to interpretation. The Company uses significant judgment to (1) determine whether, based on the technical merits, a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and (2) measure the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. Auditing management’s estimate of the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition involved auditor judgment because management’s estimate is complex, requires a high degree of judgment and is based on interpretations of tax laws and legal rulings. How we addressed the matter in our audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s accounting process for uncertain tax positions. For example, this included controls over the Company’s assessment of the technical merits of tax positions and management’s process to measure the benefit of those tax positions. Among other procedures performed, we involved our tax professionals to assess the technical merits of the Company’s tax positions. This included assessing the Company’s correspondence with the relevant tax authorities and evaluating income tax opinions or other third-party advice obtained by the Company. We also evaluated the appropriateness of the Company’s accounting for its tax positions taking into consideration relevant international and local income tax laws and legal rulings. We analyzed the Company’s assumptions and data used to determine the amount of tax benefit to recognize and tested the accuracy of the calculations. We also evaluated the adequacy of the Company’s financial statement disclosures in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements related to these tax matters. We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1952. Dallas, Texas February 20, 2020 57 ITEM 9. Changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure Not applicable. ITEM 9A. Controls and procedures Disclosure controls and procedures An evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that those disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Internal control over financial reportin g Report by management on internal control over financial reporting The management of TI is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. TI’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements issued for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2019 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. TI management assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria) in Internal Control − Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2019, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on the COSO criteria. TI’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which immediately follows this report. 58 Report of independent registered public accounting firm on internal control over financial reporting Report of independent registered public accounting firm To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Texas Instruments Incorporated Opinion on internal control over financial reporting We have audited Texas Instruments Incorporated’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Texas Instruments Incorporated (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes, and our report dated February 20, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying report by management on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

PART I ITEM 1. Business. We design and make semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. We began operations in 1930. We are incorporated in Delaware, headquartered in Dallas, Texas, and have design, manufacturing or sales operations in more than 30 countries. We have two reportable segments: Analog and Embedded Processing. We report the results of our remaining business activities in Other. In 2018, we generated $15.78 billion of revenue. Our business model is designed around four sustainable competitive advantages that we believe, in combination, put us in a unique class of companies. These advantages include (1) a strong foundation of manufacturing and technology, (2) a broad portfolio of differentiated analog and embedded processing products, (3) the broadest reach of market channels and (4) diversity and longevity of our products, markets and customer positions. Our strategic focus, and where we invest the majority of our resources, is on Analog and Embedded Processing, with a particular emphasis on designing and selling those products into the industrial and automotive markets, which we believe represent the best growth opportunities. Analog and embedded processing products sold into industrial and automotive markets provide long product life cycles, intrinsic diversity and less capital-intensive manufacturing, which we believe offer stability, profitability and strong cash generation. This business model is the foundation of our capital management strategy, which is based on our belief that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is important for maximizing shareholder value over the long term. We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. Free cash flow is cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. The combined effect of these sustainable competitive advantages is that over time we have gained market share in Analog and Embedded Processing and have grown and returned free cash flow. TI’s business model puts us in a unique class of companies with the ability to grow, generate cash and return that cash to shareholders. Product information Semiconductors are electronic components that serve as the building blocks inside modern electronic systems and equipment. Semiconductors, generally known as “chips,” combine multiple transistors to form a complete electronic circuit. We have tens of thousands of products that are used to accomplish many different things, such as converting and amplifying signals, interfacing with other devices, managing and distributing power, processing data, canceling noise and improving signal resolution. This broad portfolio includes products that are integral to almost all electronic equipment. Our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels. Our segments also reflect how management allocates resources and measures results. Analog Our Analog segment generated $10.80 billion of revenue in 2018. Analog semiconductors change real-world signals, such as sound, temperature, pressure or images, by conditioning them, amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors. Analog semiconductors also are used to manage power in all electronic equipment by converting, distributing, storing, discharging, isolating and measuring electrical energy, whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or running off a battery. Our Analog products are used in many markets, particularly industrial, automotive and personal electronics. Sales of our Analog products generated about 68 percent of our revenue in 2018. According to external sources, the market for analog semiconductors was about $59 billion in 2018. Our Analog segment’s revenue in 2018 was about 18 percent of this fragmented market, the leading position. We believe we are well positioned to increase our market share over time. Our Analog segment includes the following major product lines: Power, Signal Chain and High Volume. Power Power includes products that help customers manage power in electronic systems. Our broad portfolio is designed to manage power requirements across different voltage levels using battery management solutions, portable components, power supply controls, point-of-load products, switches and interfaces, integrated protection devices, high-voltage products, and mobile lighting and display products. 2 Signal Chain Signal Chain includes products that sense, condition and measure real-world signals to allow information to be transferred or converted for further processing and control. Our Signal Chain products, which serve a variety of end markets, include amplifiers, data converters, interface products, motor drives, clocks and sensing products. High Volume High Volume includes integrated analog and standard products that are primarily sold into markets such as personal electronics, industrial and automotive. These products support applications like displays and automotive safety systems. Embedded Processing Our Embedded Processing segment generated $3.55 billion of revenue in 2018. Embedded Processing products are the “brains” of many types of electronic equipment. Embedded processors are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for various combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application. Our devices vary from simple, low-cost microcontrollers used in applications such as electric toothbrushes to highly specialized, complex devices used in automotive applications such as infotainment systems and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). Our Embedded Processing products are used in many markets, particularly industrial and automotive. An important characteristic of our Embedded Processing products is that our customers often invest their own research and development (R&D) to write software that operates on our products. This investment tends to increase the length of our customer relationships because many customers prefer to re-use software from one product generation to the next. Sales of Embedded Processing products generated about 23 percent of our revenue in 2018. According to external sources, the market for embedded processors was about $21 billion in 2018. Our Embedded Processing segment’s revenue in 2018 was about 18 percent of this fragmented market, among the leaders. We believe we are well positioned to increase our market share over time. Our Embedded Processing segment includes the following major product lines: Connected Microcontrollers and Processors. Connected Microcontrollers Connected Microcontrollers includes microcontrollers, microcontrollers with integrated wireless capabilities and stand-alone wireless connectivity solutions. Microcontrollers are self-contained systems with a processor core, memory and peripherals that are designed to control a set of specific tasks for electronic equipment. Microcontrollers tend to have minimal requirements for memory, program length and software complexity. Our products are used in a wide range of applications and incorporate both wired and wireless communication with integrated analog functions to enable electronic equipment to sense, connect, log and transfer data. Processors Processors includes digital signal processors (DSPs) and applications processors. DSPs perform mathematical computations almost instantaneously to process or improve digital data. Applications processors are designed for specific computing activity . Other We report the results of our remaining business activities in Other, which includes operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for individually reportable segments and cannot be aggregated with other operating segments. Other generated $1.43 billion of revenue in 2018 and includes revenue from DLP ® products (primarily used in projectors to create high-definition images), calculators and certain custom semiconductors known as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). In Other, we also include items that are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments. Examples of these items include acquisition charges; restructuring charges; and certain corporate-level items, such as litigation expenses, environmental costs, insurance settlements, and gains and losses from other activities, including asset dispositions. 3 Markets for our products The table below lists the major markets for our products in 2018 and the estimated percentage of our 2018 revenue that the market represented.

As a result, we face significant global competition from dozens of large and small companies, including both broad-based suppliers and niche suppliers. Our competitors also include emerging companies, particularly in Asia, that sell products into the same markets in which we operate. We believe that competitive performance in the semiconductor market generally depends on several factors, including the breadth of a company’s product line, the strength and depth of its channels to market, technological innovation, product development execution, technical support, customer service, quality, reliability, capacity and price. In addition, manufacturing process and package technologies that provide differentiated levels of performance are a competitive factor for our Analog products and customers’ prior investments in software development is a competitive factor for our Embedded Processing products. Product cycle The global semiconductor market is characterized by constant, though generally incremental, advances in product designs and manufacturing processes. Semiconductor prices and manufacturing costs tend to decline over time as manufacturing processes and product life cycles mature. Market cycle The “semiconductor cycle” refers to the ebb and flow of supply and demand and the building and depleting of inventories. The semiconductor market historically has been characterized by periods of tight supply caused by strengthening demand and/or insufficient manufacturing capacity, followed by periods of surplus inventory caused by weakening demand and/or excess manufacturing capacity. These are typically referred to as upturns and downturns in the semiconductor cycle. The semiconductor cycle could be affected by the significant time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing facilities. We employ several strategies to dampen the effect of the semiconductor cycle on TI. We plan manufacturing facility and equipment expansion ahead of demand. We focus our resources on our Analog and Embedded Processing segments, which serve diverse markets and diverse customers. This diversity reduces our dependence on the performance of a single market or small group of customers. Additionally, we utilize consignment inventory programs with our customers and distributors that give us improved insight into customer demand. Seasonality Our revenue is subject to some seasonal variation. Historically, our sequential revenue growth rate tends to be weaker in the first and fourth quarters when compared with the second and third quarters. Customers, sales and distribution We sell our products to about 100,000 customers. Our customer base is diverse, with more than one-third of our revenue derived from customers outside our largest 100. We market and sell our products through direct sales channels, including our broad sales force and our website, and through distributors. About 65 percent of our sales are fulfilled through our distributors, and they maintain inventory of our products. In order to provide high service levels for our customers, over the last several years we have been investing to have a closer direct relationship with a large, diverse customer base. Our investments in new and improved capabilities include website and e-commerce enhancements for demand creation as well as inventory consignment programs and order fulfillment services. 5 Manufacturing Semiconductor manufacturing begins with a sequence of photolithographic and chemical processing steps that fabricate a number of semiconductor devices on a thin silicon wafer. Each device on the wafer is packaged and tested. The entire process takes place in highly specialized facilities, with most products requiring 6 to 14 weeks for completion. We own and operate semiconductor manufacturing facilities in North America, Asia, Japan and Europe. These include both wafer fabrication and assembly/test facilities. Our facilities require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixed-cost assets once in operation. We invest in manufacturing technologies and do most of our manufacturing in-house. This strategic decision to directly control our manufacturing helps ensure a consistent supply of products for our customers and also allows us to invest in technology that differentiates the features of our products. We have focused on creating a competitive manufacturing cost advantage by investing in our advanced analog 300-millimeter capacity, which has about a 40 percent cost advantage per unpackaged chip over 200-millimeter. To strengthen this advantage, we are planning our next phase of 300-millimeter capacity expansion as 300-millimeter wafers will continue to support the majority of our Analog growth. We expect to continue to maintain sufficient internal manufacturing capacity to meet the vast majority of our production needs, and to obtain manufacturing equipment to support new technology developments and revenue growth. To supplement our manufacturing capacity and maximize our responsiveness to customer demand, we use the capacity of outside suppliers, commonly known as foundries, and subcontractors. In 2018, we sourced about 20 percent of our total wafers from external foundries and about 40 percent of our assembly/test services from subcontractors. Inventory Our long-term inventory strategy is to maintain high levels of customer service and stable lead times, minimize inventory obsolescence and improve manufacturing asset utilization. To capitalize on manufacturing efficiencies, we build in advance of demand low-volume, long-lived devices with a broad customer base and a low risk of obsolescence. Additionally, we sometimes maintain product inventory in unfinished wafer form to allow greater flexibility in periods of high demand. Further, we have improved insight into demand and are better able to manage our factory loadings because over time we have increased consignment inventory programs with our customers and distributors. About 65 percent of TI revenue is fulfilled from consignment programs. Our strategy and expected customer demand will cause our inventory levels to fluctuate over time. Longer term, we expect to carry more inventory than we have in the past as we move towards higher consignment levels and more long-lived, low-volume devices to serve industrial customers, a growing portion of our business. Backlog We define backlog as of a particular date as purchase orders with a customer-requested delivery date within a specified length of time. Our backlog at any particular date may not be indicative of revenue for any future period. As customer requirements and industry conditions change, orders may be subject to cancellation or modification of terms such as pricing, quantity or delivery date. Customer order placement practices continually evolve based on customers’ individual business needs and capabilities, as well as industry supply and capacity considerations. Further, our consignment programs do not result in backlog because the order occurs at the same time as delivery, i.e., when the customer pulls the product from consigned inventory. Our backlog of orders was $1.45 billion at December 31, 2018, and $1.32 billion at December 31, 2017. Raw materials We purchase materials, parts and supplies from a number of suppliers. In some cases we purchase such items from sole-source suppliers. The materials, parts and supplies essential to our business are generally available at present, and we believe that such materials, parts and supplies will be available in the foreseeable future. Intellectual property We own many patents, and have many patent applications pending, in the United States and other countries in fields relating to our business. We have developed a strong, broad-based patent portfolio and continually add patents to that portfolio. We also have license agreements, which vary in duration, involving rights to our portfolio or those of other companies. We do not consider our business materially dependent upon any one patent or patent license. 6 We often participate in industry initiatives to set technical standards. Our competitors may participate in the same initiatives. Participation in these initiatives may require us to license certain of our patents to other companies on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. We own trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business. These trademarks are valuable assets, the most important of which are “Texas Instruments” and our corporate monogram.

You should read the following risk factors in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and in materials incorporated by reference into these filings. These risk factors are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to TI, a company with broad international operations. Like other companies, we are susceptible to any potential downturn associated with increasing protectionism, trade tensions and macroeconomic weakness , including any potential downturn associated with the pending withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. These may affect the general economic climate and our performance and the performance of our customers. Similarly, the price of our securities is subject to volatility due to fluctuations in general market conditions, actual financial results that do n ot meet our and/or the investment community’s expectations, changes in our and/or the investment community’s expectations for our future results, dividends or share repurchases, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We face substantial competition that requires us to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressures. We face intense technological and pricing competition in the markets in which we operate. We expect this competition will continue to increase from large competitors and from small competitors serving niche markets, and also from emerging companies, particularly in Asia, that sell products into the same markets in which we operate. For example, we may face increased competition as a result of China actively promoting and reshaping its domestic semiconductor industry through policy changes and investment. These actions may restrict us from participating in the China market or may prevent us from competing effectively with Chinese companies. Certain competitors possess sufficient financial, technical and management resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably against our products, and consolidation among our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively. Additionally, traditional intellectual property licensors are increasingly providing functionality, designs and complete hardware or software solutions that compete with our products. The price and product development pressures that result from competition may lead to reduced profit margins and lost business opportunities in the event that we are unable to match the price declines or cost efficiencies, or meet the technological, product, support, software or manufacturing advancements of our competitors. Changes in expected demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our customers include companies in a wide range of end markets and sectors within those markets. If demand in one or more sectors within our end markets declines or the rate of growth slows, our results of operations may be adversely affected. The cyclical nature of the semiconductor market may lead to significant and rapid increases and decreases in product demand. Additionally, the loss or significant curtailment of purchases by one or more of our large customers, including curtailments due to a change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policies or practices of these customers, or the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustments, may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our results of operations also might suffer because of a general decline in customer demand resulting from, for example: uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets; natural events or domestic or international political, social, economic or other conditions; breaches of customer information technology systems that disrupt customer operations; or a customer’s inability to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity. Our ability to match inventory and production with the product mix needed to fill orders may affect our ability to meet a quarter’s revenue forecast. In addition, when responding to customers’ requests for shorter shipment lead times, we manufacture products based on forecasts of customers’ demands. These forecasts are based on multiple assumptions. If we inaccurately forecast customer demand, we may hold inadequate, excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 8 Our global operations subject us to risks associated with domestic or international political, social, economic or other conditions. We have facilities in more than 30 countries. About 85 percent of our revenue comes from shipments to locations outside the United States; in particular, shipments of products into China typically represent a large portion of our revenue. We are exposed to political, social and economic conditions, security risks, terrorism or other hostile acts, health conditions, labor conditions, and possible disruptions in transportation, communications and information technology networks of the various countries in which we operate. Additionally, certain countries where we operate have experienced, and other countries may experience, increasing protectionism that may impact global trade, including tariffs, import or export restrictions, trade embargoes and sanctions, restrictions on cross-border investment and other trade barriers. This could result in an adverse effect on our operations and our financial results. In addition, our global operations expose us to periods when the U.S. dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the non-U.S. currencies in which we transact business. The remeasurement of non-U.S. dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our operating results and our reputation could be adversely affected by breaches or disruptions of information technology systems. Breaches or disruptions of our information technology systems or the systems of our customers, vendors and other third parties could be caused by factors such as computer viruses, system failures, restricted network access, unauthorized access, terrorism, employee malfeasance, or human error. These events could, among other things, compromise our information technology networks; result in corrupt or lost data or the unauthorized release of our, our customers’ or our suppliers’ confidential or proprietary information; cause a disruption to our manufacturing and other operations; result in the release of personal data; or cause us to incur costs associated with increased protection, remediation, regulatory inquiries or penalties, any of which could adversely affect our operating results and our reputation. Cybersecurity threats are frequent and constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of defending against them. Our results of operations could be affected by natural events in the locations in which we operate. We have manufacturing, data and design facilities and other operations in locations subject to natural occurrences such as severe weather, geological events or health epidemics that could disrupt operations. A natural disaster that results in a prolonged disruption to our operations may adversely affect our results and financial condition. Rapid technological change in markets we serve requires us to develop new technologies and products. Rapid technological change in markets we serve could contribute to shortened product life cycles and a decline in average selling prices of our products. Our results of operations depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop, manufacture and market innovative products in a timely manner. We make significant investments in research and development to improve existing technology and products, develop new products to meet changing customer demands, and improve our production processes. In some cases, we might not realize a return or the expected return on our investments because they are generally made before commercial viability can be assured. Further, projects that are commercially viable may not contribute to our operating results until at least a few years after they are completed. We face supply chain and manufacturing risks. We rely on third parties to supply us with goods and services in a cost-effective and timely manner. Our access to needed goods and services may be adversely affected by potential disputes with suppliers or disruptions in our suppliers’ operations as a result of, for example: quality excursions; uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets; domestic or international political, social, economic and other conditions; natural events in the locations in which our suppliers operate; or limited or delayed access to key raw materials, natural resources and utilities. Additionally, a breach of our suppliers’ information technology systems could result in a release of our confidential or proprietary information. If our suppliers are unable to access credit markets and other sources of needed liquidity, we may be unable to obtain needed supplies, collect accounts receivable or access needed technology. In particular, our manufacturing processes and critical manufacturing equipment require that certain key raw materials, natural resources and utilities be available. Limited or delayed access to and high costs of these items could adversely affect our results of operations. Our products contain materials that are subject to conflict minerals reporting requirements. Our relationships with customers and suppliers may be adversely affected if we are unable to describe our products as conflict-free. Additionally, our costs may increase if one or more of our customers demand that we change the sourcing of materials we cannot identify as conflict-free. 9 Our inability to timely implement new manufacturing technologies or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect our results of operations. We subcontract a po rtion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our products, and we depend on third parties to provide advanced logic manufacturing process technology development. We do not have long-term contracts with all of these suppliers, and the number o f alternate suppliers is limited. Reliance on these suppliers involves risks, including possible shortages of capacity in periods of high demand, suppliers’ inability to develop and deliver advanced logic manufacturing process technology in a timely, cost effective, and appropriate manner and the possibility of suppliers’ imposition of increased costs on us. Our results of operations and our reputation could be affected by warranty claims, product liability claims, product recalls or legal proceedings. Claims based on warranty, product liability, epidemic or delivery failures, or other grounds relating to our products, manufacturing, services, designs, communications or cybersecurity could lead to significant expenses as we defend the claims or pay damage awards or settlements. In the event of a claim, we may also incur costs if we decide to compensate the affected customer or end consumer. Any such claims may also cause us to write off the value of related inventory. We maintain product liability insurance, but there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims. In addition, it is possible for a customer to recall a product containing a TI part, for example, with respect to products used in automotive applications or handheld electronics, which may cause us to incur costs and expenses relating to the recall. Any of these events could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and reputation. Our operations could be affected by the complex laws, rules and regulations to which our business is subject. We are subject to complex laws, rules and regulations affecting our domestic and international operations relating to, for example, the environment, safety and health; exports and imports; bribery and corruption; tax; data privacy and protection; labor and employment; competition; market access; intellectual property ownership and infringement; and the movement of currency. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive and could restrict our ability to manufacture or ship our products and operate our business. If we fail to comply or if we become subject to enforcement activity, we could be subject to fines, penalties or other legal liability. Furthermore, should these laws, rules and regulations be amended or expanded, or new ones enacted, we could incur materially greater compliance costs or restrictions on our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business. Some of these complex laws, rules and regulations – for example, those related to environmental, safety and health requirements – may particularly affect us in the jurisdictions in which we manufacture products, especially if such laws and regulations: require the use of abatement equipment beyond what we currently employ; require the addition or elimination of a raw material or process to or from our current manufacturing processes; or impose costs, fees or reporting requirements on the direct or indirect use of energy, natural resources, or materials or gases used or emitted into the environment in connection with the manufacture of our products. A substitute for a prohibited raw material or process might not be available, or might not be available at reasonable cost. Our results of operations could be affected by changes in tax-related matters. We have facilities in more than 30 countries and as a result are subject to taxation and audit by a number of taxing authorities. Tax rates vary among the jurisdictions in which we operate. If our tax rate increases, our results of operations could be adversely affected. A number of factors could cause our tax rate to increase, including a change in the jurisdictions in which our profits are earned and taxed; a change in the mix of profits from those jurisdictions; changes in available tax credits or deductions, including for amounts relating to stock compensation; changes in applicable tax rates; changes in tariff regulations or surcharges; changes in accounting principles; or adverse resolution of audits by taxing authorities. We have deferred tax assets on our balance sheet. Changes in applicable tax laws and regulations or in our business performance could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax assets, which could also affect our results of operations. In addition, we are subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction. These laws and regulations can be complex and subject to interpretation. Changes in these laws and regulations, including those that align with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting recommendations, could affect the locations where we are deemed to earn income, which could in turn affect our results of operations. Each quarter we forecast our tax expense based on our forecast of our performance for the year. If that performance forecast changes, our forecasted tax expense will change. If in the future we repatriate any of our earnings represented by non-cash, operating assets such as inventory and fixed assets, we might incur incremental non-U.S. taxes, which could affect our results of operations. 10 Our results of operations and financial condition could be advers ely affected if a customer or a distributor suffers a loss with respect to our inventory. We have consignment inventory programs in place for some of our largest customers and distributors. If a customer or distributor were to experience a loss with respect to TI-consigned inventory, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we do not recover the full value of the lost inventory from the customer, distributor or insurer, or if our recovery is delayed. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by our distributors’ promotion of competing product lines or our distributors’ financial performance. In 2018, about 65 percent of our revenue was generated from sales of our products through distributors. Our distributors carry competing product lines, and our sales could be affected if our distributors promote competing products over our products. Moreover, our results of operations could be affected if our distributors suffer financial difficulties that result in their inability to pay amounts owed to us. Disputes with or the loss of significant distributors could be disruptive or harmful to our current business. Our margins may vary over time. Our profit margins may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including decreases in customer demand and shipment volume; obsolescence of our inventory; shifts in our product mix; changes in tariffs; changes in our manufacturing processes; and new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting practices or standards. In addition, we operate in a highly competitive market environment that might adversely affect pricing for our products. Because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating costs is fixed. In general, these fixed costs do not decline with reductions in customer demand or factory loadings, and can adversely affect profit margins as a result. Our performance depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights and to maintain freedom of operation. Access to worldwide markets depends in part on the continued strength of our intellectual property portfolio in all jurisdictions where we conduct business. There can be no assurance that, as our business evolves, we will obtain the necessary intellectual property rights, or that we will be able to independently develop the technology, software or know-how necessary to conduct our business or that we can do so without infringing the intellectual property rights of others. To the extent that we have to rely on licensed technology from others, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses at all or on terms we consider reasonable. We may, directly or indirectly, face infringement claims from third parties, including non-practicing entities that have acquired patents to pursue enforcement actions against other companies. We may also face infringement claims where we or our customers make, use or sell products and where the intellectual property laws may be less established or less predictable. These assertions, whether or not of any merit, could expose us to claims for damages and/or injunctions from third parties, as well as claims for indemnification by our customers in instances where we have a contractual or other legal obligation to indemnify them against damages resulting from infringement claims. We actively enforce and protect our own intellectual property rights. However, our efforts cannot prevent all misappropriation or improper use of our protected technology and information, including, for example, third parties’ use of our patented or copyrighted technology, or our trade secrets in their products without the right to do so, or third parties’ sale of counterfeit products bearing our trademark. The risk of unfair copying or cloning may impede our ability to sell our products. The laws of countries where we operate may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as U.S. laws. Our debt could affect our operations and financial condition. From time to time, we issue debt securities with various interest rates and maturities. While we believe we will have the ability to service this debt, our ability to make principal and interest payments when due depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles, and business and other factors affecting our operations, including our other risk factors, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, our obligation to make principal and interest payments could divert funds that otherwise would be invested in our operations or returned to shareholders, or could cause us to raise funds by, for example, issuing new debt or equity or selling assets. 11 Our results of operations and liquidity could be affected by changes in the financial markets. We maintain bank accounts, one or more multi-year revolving credit agreements, and a portfolio of investments to support the financing needs of the company. Our ability to fund our operations, invest in our business, make strategic acquisitions, service our debt obligations and meet our cash return objectives depends upon continuous access to our bank and investment accounts, and may depend on access to our bank credit lines that support commercial paper borrowings and provide additional liquidity through short-term bank loans. If we are unable to access these accounts and credit lines (for example, due to instability in the financial markets), our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected and our ability to access the capital markets or redeem our investments could be restricted. Increases in health care and pension benefit costs could affect our results of operations and financial condition. Federal and state health care reform programs could increase our costs with regard to medical coverage of our employees, which could reduce profitability and affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, obligations related to our pension and other postretirement plans reflect assumptions that affect the planned funding and costs of these plans, including the actual return on plan assets, discount rates, plan participant population demographics and changes in pension regulations. Changes in these assumptions may affect plan funding, cash flow and results of operations, and our costs and funding obligations could increase significantly if our plans’ actual experience differs from these assumptions. Our continued success depends in part on our ability to retain and recruit a sufficient number of qualified employees in a competitive environment. Our continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel, as well as the effective management of succession for key employees. Skilled and experienced personnel in our industry, including engineering, management, marketing, technical and staff personnel, are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key engineering, management and technical personnel that we require to execute our business strategy. Our ability to recruit internationally or deploy employees to various locations may be limited by immigration laws. Our ability to successfully implement business and organizational changes could affect our business plans and results of operations. From time to time, we undertake business and organizational changes, including acquisitions, divestitures and restructuring actions, to support or carry out our strategic objectives. Our failure to successfully implement these changes could adversely affect our business plans and operating results. For example, we may not realize the expected benefits of an acquisition if we are unable to timely and successfully integrate acquired operations, product lines and technology, and our pre-acquisition due diligence may not identify all possible issues and risks that might arise with respect to an acquisition. Further, we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth or cost savings benefits of business and organizational changes, and restructuring charges could differ materially in amount and timing from our expectations. Material impairments of our goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our results of operations. We have a significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet. Charges associated with impairments of goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. ITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.

Management’s Discuss ion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview We design, make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. Our business model is designed around the following four sustainable competitive advantages that we believe, in combination, put us in a unique class of companies: • A strong foundation of manufacturing and technology. We invest in manufacturing technologies and do most of our manufacturing in-house. This strategic decision to directly control our manufacturing helps ensure a consistent supply of products for our customers and also allows us to invest in technology that differentiates the features of our products. We have focused on creating a competitive manufacturing cost advantage by investing in our advanced analog 300-millimeter capacity, which has about a 40 percent cost advantage per unpackaged chip over 200-millimeter. To strengthen this advantage, we are planning our next phase of 300-millimeter capacity expansion as 300-millimeter wafers will continue to support the majority of our Analog growth. • Broad portfolio of differentiated analog and embedded processing semiconductors. Our customers need multiple chips for their systems. The breadth of our portfolio means we can meet more of these needs than our competitors can, which gives us access to more customers and the opportunity to sell more products and generate more revenue per customer system. We invest more than $1 billion each year to develop new products for our portfolio, which includes tens of thousands of products. • Broadest reach of market channels. Customers often begin their initial product selection process and design-in journey on our website, and the breadth of our portfolio attracts more customers to our website than any of our competitors’ websites. Our web presence, combined with our global sales force that is also greater in size than those of our competitors, are advantages that give us unique access to about 100,000 customers designing TI semiconductors into their end products. • Diversity and longevity of our products, markets and customer positions. Together, the attributes above result in diverse and long-lived positions that deliver high terminal value to our shareholders. Because of the breadth of our portfolio, we are not dependent on any single product, customer, technology or market. Some of our products generate revenue for decades, which strengthens the return on our investments. Our strategic focus, and where we invest the majority of our resources, is on Analog and Embedded Processing, with a particular emphasis on designing and selling those products into the industrial and automotive markets, which we believe represent the best growth opportunities. Analog and embedded processing products sold into industrial and automotive markets provide long product life cycles, intrinsic diversity and less capital-intensive manufacturing, which we believe offer stability, profitability and strong cash generation. This business model is the foundation of our capital management strategy, which is based on our belief that free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is important for maximizing shareholder value over the long term. We also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to shareholders. The combined effect of these sustainable competitive advantages is that over time we have gained market share in Analog and Embedded Processing and have grown free cash flow. Our business model puts us in a unique class of companies with the ability to grow, generate cash and return that cash to shareholders. Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document. In the following discussion of our results of operations: • Our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels, and how management allocates resources and measures results. See Note 1 to the financial statements for more information regarding our segments. • When we discuss our results : o Unless otherwise noted, changes in our revenue are attributable to changes in customer demand, which are evidenced by fluctuations in shipment volumes. o New products tend not to have a significant impact on our revenue in any given period because we sell such a large number of products. o From time to time , our revenue and gross profit are affected by changes in demand for higher-priced or lower-priced products, which we refer to as changes in the “mix” of products shipped. 16 o Because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed. When factory loading s decrease, our fixed costs are spread over reduced output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins decrease. Conversely, as factory loadings increase, our fixed costs are spread over increased output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins increase. Increases and decreases in factory loadings tend to correspond to increases and decreases in demand. • The 2017 enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) reduces our annual operating tax rate, which does not include discrete tax items, from 31 percent in 2017 to an ongoing rate of about 16 percent starting in 2019. In 2018, our annual operating tax rate was 20 percent, 4 percentage points higher, primarily due to a transitional non-cash expense. For an explanation of the term “annual operating tax rate,” see the Non-GAAP financial information section. • After a sustained period of growth, in late 2018 the semiconductor market entered a downturn. As a result, demand for our products weakened, and we expect this weakness to continue in 2019. During this time, we will continue to be disciplined with our operating plan and expenses, while focusing on long-term investments to strengthen our competitive advantages. • All dollar amounts in the tables are stated in millions of U.S. dollars. Results of operations We continued to perform well in 2018, even as the year ended with a semiconductor market slowdown. We focus on Analog and Embedded Processing, with an emphasis on the industrial and automotive markets, because these products serve highly diverse markets with thousands of applications and have long-term growth opportunities. Gross margin of 65.1 percent reflected the quality of our product portfolio, as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, including the benefit of 300-millimeter Analog production. Our focus on Analog and Embedded Processing allows us to generate strong cash flow from operations. Our cash flow from operations of $7.19 billion underscored the strength of our business model. Free cash flow was $6.06 billion and represented 38.4 percent of revenue, up from 31.2 percent a year ago. During 2018, we returned $7.66 billion to shareholders through a combination of stock repurchases and dividends. Our strategy is to return all free cash flow to shareholders. Our dividends represented 42 percent of free cash flow, underscoring their sustainability. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the Non-GAAP financial information section. Details of financial results – 2018 compared with 2017 Revenue of $15.78 billion increased $823 million, or 6 percent, primarily due to higher revenue from Analog. Embedded Processing also grew. Gross profit of $10.28 billion was up $663 million, or 7 percent, due to higher revenue and lower manufacturing costs. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit increased to 65.1 percent from 64.3 percent. Operating expenses (R&D and SG&A) were $3.24 billion compared with $3.20 billion. Acquisition charges of $318 million were non-cash. See Note 8 to the financial statements. Operating profit was $6.71 billion, or 42.5 percent of revenue, compared with $6.08 billion, or 40.7 percent of revenue. Other income and expense (OI&E) was $98 million of income compared with $75 million of income. See Note 13 to the financial statements. Interest and debt expense of $125 million increased $47 million due to the issuance of additional long-term debt. Our provision for income taxes was $1.11 billion compared with $2.40 billion, which includes a discrete tax benefit of $198 million in 2018 and a discrete tax expense of $540 million in 2017. The decrease in our tax provision was due to the enactment of the Tax Act in 2017, which included a reduction in the statutory tax rate in 2018 and the tax on indefinitely reinvested earnings recorded in 2017. The benefits of the Tax Act in 2018 were partially offset by higher income before income taxes. Our effective tax rate, which includes discrete tax items, was 17 percent in 2018 compared with 39 percent in 2017. See Note 5 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the U.S. statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate. Net income was $5.58 billion compared with $3.68 billion. EPS was $5.59 compared with $3.61. 17 Segment results – 2018 compared with 2017 Analog (includes Power, Signal Chain and High Volume product lines) 2018 2017 Change Revenue $ 10,801 $ 9,900 9 % Operating profit 5,109 4,468 14 % Operating profit % of revenue 47.3 % 45.1 % Analog revenue increased due to Power and, to a lesser extent, Signal Chain, partially offset by a decline in High Volume.

Details of financial results – 2017 compared with 2016 Revenue of $14.96 billion was up $1.59 billion, or 12 percent, from 2016 due to higher revenue from Analog and Embedded Processing. Gross profit of $9.61 billion was up $1.36 billion, or 16 percent, primarily due to higher revenue. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit increased to 64.3 percent from 61.8 percent. Operating expenses were $3.20 billion compared with $3.10 billion, as we allocated resources from manufacturing support and SG&A into R&D activities. Acquisition charges of $318 million were non-cash. Restructuring charges/other was a charge of $11 million compared with a credit of $15 million in 2016. These amounts are included in Other for segment reporting purposes. See Note 12 to the financial statements. Operating profit was $6.08 billion, or 40.7 percent of revenue, compared with $4.86 billion, or 36.3 percent of revenue. OI&E was $75 million of income compared with $155 million of income in 2016. Our provision for income taxes was $2.40 billion compared with $1.34 billion. The increase was due to the enactment of the Tax Act and, to a lesser extent, higher income before income taxes. Our effective tax rate, which includes discrete tax items, was 39 percent in 2017 compared with 27 percent in 2016. Net income was $3.68 billion compared with $3.60 billion. EPS was $3.61 compared with $3.48. 18 Segment results – 2017 compared with 2016 Analog 2017 2016 Change Revenue $ 9,900 $ 8,536 16 % Operating profit 4,468 3,416 31 % Operating profit % of revenue 45.1 % 40.0 % Analog revenue increased due to Power and Signal Chain. High Volume also grew, but to a lesser extent. Operating profit increased primarily due to higher revenue and associated gross profit.

Operating profit decreased by $150 million. Financial condition At the end of 2018, total cash (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments) was $4.23 billion, a decrease of $236 million from the end of 2017. Accounts receivable were $1.21 billion, a decrease of $71 million compared with the end of 2017. Days sales outstanding at the end of 2018 were 29 compared with 31 at the end of 2017. Inventory was $2.22 billion, an increase of $260 million from the end of 2017. Days of inventory at the end of 2018 were 152 compared with 134 at the end of 2017. Liquidity and capital resources Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations. Additional sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and a variable rate, revolving credit facility. Cash flows from operating activities for 2018 were $7.19 billion, an increase of $1.83 billion from 2017. This increase was due to higher net income, which benefited from a lower effective tax rate. Our revolving credit facility is with a consortium of investment-grade banks and allows us to borrow up to $2 billion until March 2023. This credit facility also serves as support for the issuance of commercial paper. As of December 31, 2018, our credit facility was undrawn, and we had no commercial paper outstanding. Investing activities for 2018 used $78 million compared with $1.13 billion in 2017. Capital expenditures were $1.13 billion compared with $695 million in 2017 and were primarily for semiconductor manufacturing equipment in both periods. We had sales of short-term investments, net of purchases, that provided cash proceeds of $1.07 billion compared with purchases of short-term investments, net of sales, that used cash of $460 million in 2017. We received $9 million from asset sales compared with $40 million in 2017. 19 Financing activities for 2018 used $6.33 billion compared with $3.73 billion in 2017. In 2018, we received net proceeds of $1.50 billion from the issuance of fixed-rate, long-term debt and retired maturing debt of $500 million. In 2017, we received net proceeds of $ 1.10 billion from the issuance of fixed-rate, long-term debt and retired maturing debt of $625 million. Dividends paid in 2018 were $2.56 billion compared with $2.10 billion in 2017, reflecting an increase in the dividend rate, partially offset by fewer sh ares outstanding. We used $5.10 billion to repurchase 49.5 million shares of our common stock compared with $2.56 billion used in 2017 to repurchase 30.6 million shares. Employee exercises of stock options provided cash proceeds of $373 million compared wi th $483 million in 2017. We had $2.44 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $1.80 billion of short-term investments as of December 31, 2018. We believe we have the necessary financial resources and operating plans to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend and debt-related payments, and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months. Non-GAAP financial information This MD&A includes references to free cash flow and ratios based on that measure. These are financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). Free cash flow was calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from the most directly comparable GAAP measure, cash flows from operating activities (also referred to as cash flow from operations). We believe that free cash flow and the associated ratios provide insight into our liquidity, our cash-generating capability and the amount of cash potentially available to return to shareholders, as well as insight into our financial performance. These non-GAAP measures are supplemental to the comparable GAAP measures. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP-based measures is provided in the table below. For Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Cash flow from operations (GAAP) $ 7,189 $ 5,363 $ 4,614 Capital expenditures (1,131 ) (695 ) (531 ) Free cash flow (non-GAAP) $ 6,058 $ 4,668 $ 4,083 Revenue $ 15,784 $ 14,961 $ 13,370 Cash flow from operations as a percent of revenue (GAAP) 45.5 % 35.8 % 34.5 % Free cash flow as a percent of revenue (non-GAAP) 38.4 % 31.2 % 30.5 % This MD&A also includes references to an annual operating tax rate, a non-GAAP term we use to describe the estimated annual effective tax rate, a GAAP measure that by definition does not include discrete tax items. We believe the term annual operating tax rate helps differentiate from the effective tax rate, which includes discrete tax items. 20 Long-term contractual obligations Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations 2019 2020/2021 2022/2023 Thereafter Total Long-term debt (a) $ 886 $ 1,281 $ 1,188 $ 3,876 $ 7,231 Purchase commitments (b) 389 469 37 15 910 Tax on indefinitely reinvested earnings (c) — 46 156 304 506 Operating leases (d) 56 82 47 39 224 Deferred compensation plans (e) 17 46 48 111 222 Total (f) $ 1,348 $ 1,924 $ 1,476 $ 4,345 $ 9,093 (a) Principal and related interest payments for our long-term debt obligations, including amounts classified as the current portion of long-term debt. (b) Includes payments for software licenses and contractual arrangements with suppliers when there is a fixed, non-cancellable payment schedule or when minimum payments are due with a reduced delivery schedule. Excludes cancellable arrangements. (c) Future payments for the one-time transition tax on our indefinitely reinvested earnings related to the enactment of the Tax Act. See Note 5 to the financial statements for more details. (d) Includes minimum payments for leased facilities and equipment and purchases of industrial gases under contracts accounted for as operating leases. (e) Estimated payments for certain liabilities that existed as of December 31, 2018. (f) Excludes $286 million of uncertain tax liabilities under ASC 740, as well as any planned future funding contributions to retirement benefit plans. Amounts associated with uncertain tax liabilities have been excluded because of the difficulty in making reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities. Regarding future funding of retirement benefit plans, we plan to contribute about $50 million in 2019, but funding projections beyond 2019 are not practical to estimate due to the rules affecting tax-deductible contributions and the impact from the plans’ asset performance, interest rates and potential U.S. and non-U.S. legislation. Critical accounting policies Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements. As disclosed in Note 2, the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. However, based on facts and circumstances inherent in developing estimates and assumptions, management believes it is unlikely that applying other estimates and assumptions would have a material impact on the financial statements. We consider the following accounting policies to be those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and that require a higher degree of judgment. Revenue recognition Based on management’s assessment of the revenue recognition criteria, we usually recognize revenue from sales of our products to distributors upon shipment or delivery to the distributors. For our consignment arrangements with distributors, delivery occurs when the distributor pulls product from consignment inventory that we store at designated locations. Recognition is not contingent upon resale of the products to the distributors’ customers in either scenario. Revenue is recognized net of allowances, which are management’s estimates of future credits to be granted to distributors under programs common in the semiconductor industry. These allowances are not material and generally include special pricing arrangements, product returns due to quality issues, and incentives designed to maximize growth opportunities. Allowances are based on analysis of historical data and contractual terms and are recorded when revenue is recognized. We believe we can reasonably and reliably estimate allowances for credits to distributors in a timely manner. Income taxes In determining net income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax provisions and the resultant tax liabilities, and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. 21 In the ordinary course of global business, th ere may be many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. The calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. Although we believe the estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given th at the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals. As part of our financial process, we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets can be recovered. If recovery is not likely, the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are estimated not to be ultimately recoverable. In this process, certain relevant criteria are evaluated including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets, the taxable income in prior years that can be used to absorb net operating losses and credit carrybacks, and taxable income in future years. Our judgment regarding future recoverability of our deferred tax assets based on these criteria may change due to various factors, including changes in U.S. or international tax laws and changes in market conditions and their impact on our assessment of taxable income in future periods. These changes, if any, may require material adjustments to the deferred tax assets and an accompanying reduction or increase in net income in the period when such determinations are made. Also, our plans for the permanent reinvestment or eventual repatriation of the accumulated earnings of certain non-U.S. operations could change. Such changes could have a material effect on tax expense in future years. Inventory valuation allowances Inventory is valued net of allowances for unsalable or obsolete raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods. Statistical allowances are determined quarterly for raw materials and work-in-process based on historical disposals of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons. For finished goods, quarterly statistical allowances are determined by comparing inventory levels of individual parts to historical shipments, current backlog and estimated future sales in order to identify inventory judged unlikely to be sold. A specific allowance for each material type will be carried if there is a significant event not captured by the statistical allowance. Examples are an end-of-life part or demand with imminent risk of cancellation. Allowances are also calculated quarterly for instances where inventoried costs for individual products are in excess of the net realizable value for those products. Actual future write-offs of inventory for salability and obsolescence reasons may differ from estimates and calculations used to determine valuation allowances due to changes in customer demand, customer negotiations, technology shifts and other factors. Changes in accounting standards See Note 2 to the financial statements for information on new accounting standards. Off-balance sheet arrangements As of December 31, 2018, we had no significant off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K. Commitments and contingencies See Note 11 to the financial statements for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies. 22 ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Foreign exchange risk The U.S. dollar is our functional currency for financial reporting. Our non-U.S. entities own assets or liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars or other currencies. Exchange rate fluctuations impact taxable income in those jurisdictions, and consequently impact our effective tax rate. Our balance sheet also reflects amounts remeasured from non-U.S. dollar currencies. Because most of the aggregate non-U.S. dollar balance sheet exposure is hedged by forward currency exchange contracts, based on year-end 2018 balances and currency exchange rates, a hypothetical 10 percent plus or minus fluctuation in non-U.S. currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar would result in a pre-tax currency exchange gain or loss of about $3 million. We use these forward currency exchange contracts to reduce the earnings impact that exchange rate fluctuations may have on our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures. For example, at year-end 2018, we had forward currency exchange contracts outstanding with a notional value of $525 million to hedge net balance sheet exposures (including $160 million to sell Japanese yen, $99 million to sell euros and $94 million to sell Indian rupees). Similar hedging activities existed at year-end 2017. Interest rate risk We have the following potential exposure to changes in interest rates: (1) the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and short-term investments, which could produce a gain or a loss; and (2) the effect of changes in interest rates on the fair value of our debt. As of December 31, 2018, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our investments in cash equivalents and short-term investments by about $4 million and decrease the fair value of our long-term debt by $330 million. Because interest rates on our long-term debt are fixed, changes in interest rates would not affect the cash flows associated with long-term debt. Equity risk Long-term investments at year-end 2018 include the following: • Investments in mutual funds – includes mutual funds that were selected to generate returns that offset changes in certain liabilities related to deferred compensation arrangements. The mutual funds hold a variety of debt and equity investments. • Investments in venture capital funds – includes investments in limited partnerships (accounted for under either the equity method or at cost as non-marketable equity securities). • Equity investments – includes non- marketable (non-publicly traded) equity securities. Investments in mutual funds are stated at fair value. Changes in prices of the mutual fund investments are expected to offset related changes in deferred compensation liabilities such that a 10 percent increase or decrease in the investments’ fair values would not materially affect operating results. Non-marketable equity securities and certain venture capital funds are stated at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from qualifying observable price changes. Investments in the remaining venture capital funds are stated using the equity method. See Note 7 to the financial statements for details of equity and other long-term investments. 23 ITEM 8.

Description of business, including segment and geographic area information We design , make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. We have two reportable segments, which are established along major categories of products as follows: • Analog – consisting of the following product lines: Power, Signal Chain and High Volume. • Embedded Processing – consisting of the following product lines: Connected Microcontrollers and Processors. We report the results of our remaining business activities in Other. Other includes operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for individually reportable segments and cannot be aggregated with other operating segments. Other includes DLP ® products, calculators and custom ASIC products. In Other, we also include items that are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments. Examples of these items include acquisition charges (see Note 8); restructuring charges (see Note 12); and certain corporate-level items, such as litigation expenses, environmental costs, insurance settlements, and gains and losses from other activities, including asset dispositions. We allocate the remainder of our expenses associated with corporate activities to our operating segments based on specific methodologies, such as percentage of operating expenses or headcount. Our centralized manufacturing and support organizations, such as facilities, procurement and logistics, provide support to our operating segments, including those in Other. Costs incurred by these organizations, including depreciation, are charged to the segments on a per-unit basis. Consequently, depreciation expense is not an independently identifiable component within the segments’ results and, therefore, is not provided. With the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segment, nor does the chief operating decision maker evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information. We have no material intersegment revenue. The accounting policies of the segments are consistent with those described below in the summary of significant accounting policies and practices. Segment information For Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Revenue: Analog $ 10,801 $ 9,900 $ 8,536 Embedded Processing 3,554 3,498 3,023 Other 1,429 1,563 1,811 Total revenue $ 15,784 $ 14,961 $ 13,370 Operating profit: Analog $ 5,109 $ 4,468 $ 3,416 Embedded Processing 1,205 1,143 817 Other 399 472 622 Total operating profit $ 6,713 $ 6,083 $ 4,855 30 Geographic area information The following geographic area information includes revenue, based on product shipment destination, and property, plant and equipment, based on physical location. The revenue information is not necessarily indicative of the geographic area in which the end applications containing our products are ultimately consumed because our products tend to be shipped to the locations where our customers manufacture their products. Specifically, many of our products are shipped to our customers in China who may include these parts in the manufacture of their own end products, which they may in turn export to their customers around the world. For Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Revenue: United States $ 2,288 $ 1,901 $ 1,682 Asia (a) 9,240 8,824 8,024 Europe, Middle East and Africa 3,047 2,907 2,393 Japan 869 1,049 1,040 Rest of world 340 280 231 Total revenue $ 15,784 $ 14,961 $ 13,370 (a) Revenue from products shipped into China was $7.0 billion, $6.6 billion and $6.0 billion in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Property, plant and equipment at our sites in China was $313 million and $236 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 2. Basis of presentation and significant accounting policies and practices Basis of presentation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The basis of these financial statements is comparable for all periods presented herein, except for the effects of adopting a new accounting standard in 2018 related to revenue recognition. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. All dollar amounts in the financial statements and tables in these notes, except per-share amounts, are stated in millions of U.S. dollars unless otherwise indicated. We have reclassified certain amounts in the prior periods’ financial statements to conform to the 2018 presentation. The preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates from which final results may vary. 31 Significant accounting policies and practices Revenue recognition We generate revenue primarily from the sale of semiconductor products, either directly to a customer or to a distributor, or at the conclusion of a consignment process. We have a variety of types of contracts with our customers and distributors. In determining whether a contract exists, we evaluate the terms of the arrangement, the relationship with the customer or distributor and their ability to pay. We recognize revenue from sales of our products, including sales to our distributors, when control is transferred. Control is considered transferred when title and risk of loss pass, when the customer becomes obligated to pay and, where required, when the customer has accepted the products. This transfer generally occurs at a point in time upon shipment or delivery to the customer or distributor, depending upon the terms of the sales order. Payment for sales to customers and distributors is generally due on our standard commercial terms. For sales to distributors, payment is not contingent upon resale of the products. Revenue from sales of our products that are subject to inventory consignment agreements is recognized at a point in time, when the customer or distributor pulls product from consignment inventory that we store at designated locations. Transfer of control occurs at that point, when title and risk of loss transfers and the customer or distributor becomes obligated to pay for the products pulled from inventory. Until the products are pulled for use or sale by the customer or distributor, we retain control over the products’ disposition, including the right to pull back or relocate the products. The revenue recognized is adjusted based on allowances, which are prepared on a portfolio basis using a most likely amount methodology based on analysis of historical data and contractual terms. These allowances, which are not material, generally include adjustments for pricing arrangements, product returns and incentives. The length of time between invoicing and payment is not significant under any of our payment terms. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. In addition, we record allowances for accounts receivable that we estimate may not be collected. We monitor collectability of accounts receivable primarily through review of accounts receivable aging. When collection is at risk, we assess the impact on amounts recorded for bad debts and, if necessary, record a charge in the period such determination is made. We recognize shipping fees, if any, received from customers in revenue. We include the related shipping and handling costs in cost of revenue. The majority of our customers pay these fees directly to third parties. Advertising costs We expense advertising and other promotional costs as incurred. This expense was $34 million, $39 million and $44 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Income taxes We account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach. We record the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns. We record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Other assessed taxes Some transactions require us to collect taxes such as sales, value-added and excise taxes from our customers. These transactions are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Income on a net (excluded from revenue) basis. 32 Earnings per share (EPS) We use the two-class method for calculating EPS because the restricted stock units (RSUs) we grant are participating securities containing non-forfeitable rights to receive dividend equivalents. Under the two-class method, a portion of net income is allocated to RSUs and excluded from the calculation of income allocated to common stock, as shown in the table below. Computation and reconciliation of earnings per common share are as follows (shares in millions): For Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Net Net Net Income Shares EPS Income Shares EPS Income Shares EPS Basic EPS: Net income $ 5,580 $ 3,682 $ 3,595 Income allocated to RSUs (43 ) (34 ) (45 ) Income allocated to common stock $ 5,537 970 $ 5.71 $ 3,648 991 $ 3.68 $ 3,550 1,003 $ 3.54 Dilutive effect of stock compensation plans 20 21 18 Diluted EPS: Net income $ 5,580 $ 3,682 $ 3,595 Income allocated to RSUs (42 ) (33 ) (44 ) Income allocated to common stock $ 5,538 990 $ 5.59 $ 3,649 1,012 $ 3.61 $ 3,551 1,021 $ 3.48 Potentially dilutive securities representing 4 million and 6 million shares of common stock that were outstanding in 2018 and 2017, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per common share during these periods because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. No potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per common share during 2016. Investments We present investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as cash equivalents, short-term investments or long-term investments, which are detailed below. See Note 7 for additional information. • Cash equivalents and short-term investments – We consider investments in available-for-sale debt securities with maturities of 90 days or less from the date of our investment to be cash equivalents. We consider investments in available-for-sale debt securities with maturities beyond 90 days from the date of our investment as being available for use in current operations and include them in short-term investments. The primary objectives of our cash equivalent and short-term investment activities are to preserve capital and maintain liquidity while generating appropriate returns. • Long-term investments – Long-term investments consist of mutual funds, venture capital funds and non-marketable equity securities. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. Cost is generally computed on a currently adjusted standard cost basis, which approximates cost on a first-in first-out basis. Standard cost is based on the normal utilization of installed factory capacity. Cost associated with underutilization of capacity is expensed as incurred. Inventory held at consignment locations is included in our finished goods inventory. Consigned inventory was $314 million and $303 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We review inventory quarterly for salability and obsolescence. A statistical allowance is provided for inventory considered unlikely to be sold. The statistical allowance is based on an analysis of historical disposal activity, historical customer shipments, as well as estimated future sales. A specific allowance for each material type will be carried if there is a significant event not captured by the statistical allowance. We write off inventory in the period in which disposal occurs. Property, plant and equipment; acquisition-related intangibles; and other capitalized costs Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Our cost basis includes certain assets acquired in business combinations that were initially recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the improvements. We amortize acquisition-related intangibles on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life of the assets. Capitalized software licenses generally are amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the license. Fully depreciated or amortized assets are written off against accumulated depreciation or amortization. 33 Impairments of long-lived assets We regularly review whether facts or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying values of property, plant and equipment or other long-lived assets, including intangible assets, are impaired. We assess the recoverability of assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with those assets to their respective carrying amounts. Any impairment charge is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. Fair value is determined by available market valuations, if applicable, or by discounted cash flows. Goodwill Goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if certain impairment indicators arise. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1 for our reporting units, which compares the fair value for each reporting unit to its associated carrying value, including goodwill. See Note 8 for additional information. Foreign currency The functional currency for our non-U.S. subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Accounts recorded in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are remeasured into the functional currency. Current assets (except inventories), deferred taxes, other assets, current liabilities and long-term liabilities are remeasured at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period. Property, plant and equipment with associated depreciation and inventories are valued at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expense accounts other than depreciation for each month are remeasured at the appropriate daily rate of exchange. Currency exchange gains and losses from remeasurement are credited or charged to OI&E. Derivatives and hedging We use derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to foreign exchange risk. These instruments are primarily forward foreign currency exchange contracts, which are used as economic hedges to reduce the earnings impact that exchange rate fluctuations may have on our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures. Gains and losses from changes in the fair value of these forward foreign currency exchange contracts are credited or charged to OI&E. We do not apply hedge accounting to our foreign currency derivative instruments. In connection with the issuance of long-term debt, we may use financial derivatives such as treasury-rate lock agreements that are recognized in AOCI and amortized over the life of the related debt. The results of these derivative transactions have not been material. We do not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. Changes in accounting standards – adopted standards for current period Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) This standard provides a single set of guidelines for revenue recognition to be used across all industries and requires additional disclosures. We adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 (ASC 606) as of January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective transition method applied only to contracts that were not completed as of the adoption date. The reported results for 2018 reflect the application of the new accounting guidance, while the reported results for prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historical accounting under ASC 605, Revenue Recognition . The most significant impact from adopting the standard relates to our accounting for royalty income on licenses of intellectual property; however, the effect of such change during any individual reporting period will not materially impact our results of operations and financial position. Although royalty income is recorded within OI&E, the new revenue guidance applies to these agreements by analogy, and therefore, such agreements have been evaluated for ASC 606 transition considerations. Under ASC 606, royalty income for our fixed-rate royalty agreements is bifurcated between two performance obligations: providing a right to use our initial patent portfolio and the right to access our future patents when those patents are developed. We have determined that the value of these agreements is allocated more heavily to the initial performance obligation. As a result, income from these agreements is recognized predominately at the time of contract execution rather than ratably over the life of the agreements, accelerating the timing of when we recognize royalty income in OI&E. The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections may result in billed accounts receivable, unbilled receivables (contract assets), and customer advances and deposits (contract liabilities). These items are included in other current and non-current assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Generally, we invoice customers for payment upon shipment or when goods are pulled from consignment inventory, which results in an unconditional right to consideration. The time frame between when the customer places an order for products and when it is shipped is less than 12 months. 34 Occasionally, as of the end of a reporting period, some performance obligations associated with contracts are unsatisfied or only partially satisfied. In accordance with the pr actical expedients available in the guidance, we do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less. Additionally, sales commissions are expensed when incurred because the a mortization period would have been one year or less. We recognized an increase to opening retained earnings of $206 million, net of taxes, as of January 1, 2018, due to the cumulative impact of adopting ASC 606. A contract asset of $283 million and deferred tax liabilities of $55 million were recorded as of January 1, 2018, related to the transition period adjustments. ASU No. 2018-02, Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income This standard allows a reclassification of stranded tax effects as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) from AOCI to retained earnings. The provisions from this guidance are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after January 1, 2019. This standard should be applied either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period (or periods) in which the effects of the Tax Act are recognized. We elected to early adopt this standard during the fourth quarter of 2018 concurrent with the completion of our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the Tax Act, applying the guidance to the period of adoption. As a result, we reclassified stranded tax effects of $30 million from the 2018 opening balance of AOCI into retained earnings. See Note 5 for additional information related to our accounting for the effects of the Tax Act. Other standards The following standards were also adopted: ASU Description Adopted Date ASU No. 2016-01 Financial Instruments – Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities January 1, 2018 ASU No. 2017-01 Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business January 1, 2018 ASU No. 2017-04 Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment October 1, 2018 ASU No. 2017-05 Other Income – Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets (Subtopic 610-20): Clarifying the Scope of Asset Derecognition Guidance and Accounting for Partial Sales of Nonfinancial Assets January 1, 2018 Changes in accounting standards – standards not yet adopted ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) This standard requires all leases that have a term of over 12 months to be recognized on the balance sheet with the liability for lease payments and the corresponding right-of-use asset initially measured at the present value of amounts expected to be paid over the term. Recognition of the costs of these leases on the income statement will be dependent upon their classification as either an operating or a finance lease. This standard is effective for interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2019. We are adopting this standard effective January 1, 2019, using the optional transition method, applying the guidance to leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the period of adoption. We are also electing certain practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance. In preparation for adoption of the standard, we have implemented system functionality to enable the preparation of financial information. The most significant impact from adopting the standard will be the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for operating leases on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, which will increase total assets by about 2 percent. ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments This standard requires entities to use a current lifetime expected credit loss methodology to measure impairments of certain financial assets. Using this methodology will result in earlier recognition of losses than under the current incurred loss approach, which requires waiting to recognize a loss until it is probable of having been incurred. There are other provisions within the standard that affect how impairments of other financial assets may be recorded and presented, and that expand disclosures. This standard will be effective for our interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted beginning January 1, 2019, and must be applied on a modified retrospective basis. We are evaluating the potential impact of this standard, but we do not expect it to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. 35 Other standards We are evaluating the impact of the following standards, but we do not expect them to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. We plan to adopt these standards as of their effective dates.

Stock compensation We have stock options outstanding to participants under long-term incentive plans. The option price per share may not be less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of the grant. The options have a 10 -year term, generally vest ratably over four years, and continue to vest after the option recipient retires. We also have RSUs outstanding to participants under long-term incentive plans. Each RSU represents the right to receive one share of TI common stock on the vesting date , which is generally four years after the date of grant. Upon vesting, the shares are issued without payment by the grantee. RSUs continue to vest after the recipient retires. Holders of RSUs receive an annual cash payment equivalent to the dividends paid on our common stock. We have options and RSUs outstanding to non-employee directors under director compensation plans. The plans generally provide for annual grants of stock options and RSUs, a one-time grant of RSUs to each new non-employee director and the issuance of TI common stock upon the distribution of stock units credited to deferred compensation accounts established for such directors. We also have an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) under which options are offered to all eligible employees in amounts based on a percentage of the employee’s compensation, subject to a cap. Under the plan, the option price per share is 85 percent of the fair market value on the exercise date. Total stock compensation expense recognized is as follows: For Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 COR $ 25 $ 36 $ 40 R&D 69 59 60 SG&A 138 147 152 Total $ 232 $ 242 $ 252 These amounts include expenses related to non-qualified stock options, RSUs and stock options offered under our ESPP and are net of estimated forfeitures. We recognize compensation expense for non-qualified stock options and RSUs on a straight-line basis over the minimum service period required for vesting of the award, adjusting for estimated forfeitures based on historical activity. Awards issued to employees who are retirement eligible or nearing retirement eligibility are expensed on an accelerated basis. Options issued under our ESPP are expensed over a three-month period. 36 Fair-value methods and assumptions We account for all awards granted under our various stock compensation plans at fair value. We estimate the fair values for non-qualified stock options using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions: For Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Weighted average grant date fair value, per share $ 23.20 $ 16.49 $ 10.03 Weighted average assumptions used: Expected volatility 23 % 24 % 25 % Expected lives (in years) 7.2 7.2 7.3 Risk-free interest rates 2.57 % 2.36 % 1.72 % Expected dividend yields 2.25 % 2.52 % 2.87 % We determine expected volatility on all options granted using available implied volatility rates. We believe that market-based measures of implied volatility are currently the best available indicators of the expected volatility used in these estimates. We determine expected lives of options based on the historical option exercise experience of our optionees using a rolling 10- year average. We believe the historical experience method is the best estimate of future exercise patterns currently available. Risk-free interest rates are determined using the implied yield currently available for zero -coupon U.S. government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options. Expected dividend yields are based on the annualized approved quarterly dividend rate and the current market price of our common stock at the time of grant. No assumption for a future dividend rate change is included unless there is an approved plan to change the dividend in the near term. The fair value per share of RSUs is determined based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. Our ESPP is a discount-purchase plan and consequently the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model is not used to determine the fair value per share of these awards. The fair value per share under this plan equals the amount of the discount. Long-term incentive and director compensation plans Stock option and RSU transactions under our long-term incentive and director compensation plans are as follows: Stock Options RSUs Weighted Average Weighted Average Exercise Price Grant Date Fair Shares per Share Shares Value per Share Outstanding grants, December 31, 2017 44,754,593 $ 48.49 9,225,643 $ 55.40 Granted 4,617,486 110.07 1,247,239 110.05 Stock options exercised/RSUs vested (8,432,458 ) 42.63 (2,769,994 ) 44.50 Forfeited and expired (1,034,167 ) 77.30 (397,345 ) 70.34 Outstanding grants, December 31, 2018 39,905,454 56.10 7,305,543 66.72 The weighted average grant date fair values per share of RSUs granted in 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $110.05, $79.52 and $53.98, respectively. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, the total grant date fair values of shares vested from RSU grants were $123 million, $149 million and $178 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, the number of shares remaining available for future issuance under these plans was 50,167,414. 37 Summarized information about stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2018 , is as follows: Stock Options Outstanding Options Exercisable Number Weighted Average Weighted Average Number Weighted Average Exercise Price Outstanding Remaining Contractual Exercise Price Exercisable Exercise Price Range (Shares) Life (Years) per Share (Shares) per Share $ 14.47 to 20.00 573,629 0.1 $ 14.96 573,629 $ 14.96 20.01 to 40.00 9,508,056 2.9 31.21 9,508,056 31.21 40.01 to 60.00 19,883,804 6.2 50.95 12,397,285 49.53 60.01 to 80.00 5,612,386 8.1 79.21 1,143,118 79.20 80.01 to 100.00 37,917 9.3 91.16 3,714 91.54 100.01 to 113.30 4,289,662 9.1 110.15 — — 14.47 to 113.30 39,905,454 5.9 56.10 23,625,802 42.76 In 2018, 2017 and 2016, the aggregate intrinsic values (i.e., the difference in the closing market price on the date of exercise and the exercise price paid by the optionee) of options exercised were $ 561 million , $ 632 million and $ 424 million , respectively. Summarized information as of December 31, 2018 , about outstanding stock options that are vested and expected to vest, as well as stock options that are currently exercisable, is as follows: Outstanding Stock Options (Fully Vested and Options Expected to Vest) (a) Exercisable Number of outstanding (shares) 39,274,492 23,625,802 Weighted average remaining contractual life (in years) 5.9 4.7 Weighted average exercise price per share $ 55.60 $ 42.76 Intrinsic value (millions of dollars) $ 1,591 $ 1,222 (a) Includes effects of expected forfeitures of approximately 1 million shares. Excluding the effects of expected forfeitures, the aggregate intrinsic value of stock options outstanding was $1.60 billion. As of December 31, 2018 , total future compensation related to equity awards not yet recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Income was $ 224 million , consisting of $97 million related to unvested stock options and $127 million related to unvested RSUs. The $224 million is expected to be recognized as follows: $110 million in 2019, $ 72 million in 2020, $37 million in 2021 and $ 5 million in 2022. Employee stock purchase plan Options outstanding under the ESPP as of December 31, 2018 , had an exercise price equal to 85 percent of the fair market value of TI common stock on the date of automatic exercise. The automatic exercise occurred on January 2, 2019, resulting in an exercise price of $80.29 per share. Of the total outstanding options, none were exercisable as of December 31, 2018. ESPP transactions are as follows: ESPP (Shares) Exercise Price Outstanding grants, December 31, 2017 202,179 $ 89.74 Granted 847,535 87.48 Exercised (819,878 ) 90.06 Outstanding grants, December 31, 2018 229,836 80.29 The weighted average grant date fair values per share of options granted under the ESPP in 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $15.43 , $12.99 and $9.79 , respectively. In 2018 , 2017 and 2016, the total intrinsic value of options exercised under these plans was $13 million, $13 million and $12 million, respectively . As of December 31, 2018, the number of shares remaining available for future issuance under this plan was 34,555,101. 38 Eff ect on shares outstanding and treasury shares Treasury shares were acquired in connection with the board-authorized stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2018, $16.14 billion of stock repurchase authorizations remain, and no expiration date has been specified. Our current practice is to issue shares of common stock from treasury shares upon exercise of stock options, distribution of director deferred compensation and vesting of RSUs. The following table reflects the changes in our treasury shares: Stock Options RSUs Treasury Shares Balance, December 31, 2015 729,547,527 Repurchases 35,480,036 Shares used for: Stock options/RSUs (14,516,606 ) (5,639,666 ) Stock applied to taxes — 1,336,476 ESPP (1,362,202 ) — Director deferred stock units — — (13,587 ) Total issued (15,878,808 ) (4,303,190 ) (20,181,998 ) Balance, December 31, 2016 744,831,978 Repurchases 30,570,129 Shares used for: Stock options/RSUs (13,313,019 ) (4,419,464 ) Stock applied to taxes — 1,058,100 ESPP (1,065,757 ) — Director deferred stock units — — (4,750 ) Total issued (14,378,776 ) (3,361,364 ) (17,740,140 ) Balance, December 31, 2017 757,657,217 Repurchases 49,482,220 Shares used for: Stock options/RSUs (8,432,458 ) (2,769,994 ) Stock applied to taxes — 553,720 ESPP (819,878 ) — Director deferred stock units — — (5,181 ) Total issued (9,252,336 ) (2,216,274 ) (11,468,610 ) Balance, December 31, 2018 795,665,646 The effects on cash flows are as follows: For Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Proceeds from common stock transactions (a) $ 373 $ 483 $ 472 Tax benefit realized from stock compensation $ 179 $ 341 $ 255 Reduction to deferred tax asset (43 ) (91 ) (105 ) Excess tax benefit for stock compensation $ 136 $ 250 $ 150 (a) Net of taxes paid for employee shares withheld of $60 million, $83 million and $70 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 39 4. Profit sharing plans Profit sharing benefits are generally formulaic and determined by one or more subsidiary or company-wide financial metrics. We pay profit sharing benefits primarily under the company-wide TI Employee Profit Sharing Plan. This plan provides for profit sharing to be paid based solely on TI’s operating margin for the full calendar year. Under this plan, TI must achieve a minimum threshold of 10 percent operating margin before any profit sharing is paid. At 10 percent operating margin, profit sharing will be 2 percent of eligible payroll. The maximum amount of profit sharing available under the plan is 20 percent of eligible payroll, which is paid only if TI’s operating margin is at or above 35 percent for a full calendar year. We recognized $354 million , $355 million and $346 million of profit sharing expense under the TI Employee Profit Sharing Plan in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 5. Income taxes Income before income taxes is comprised of the following components: For Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 U.S. $ 5,672 $ 5,130 $ 3,953 Non-U.S. 1,014 950 977 Total $ 6,686 $ 6,080 $ 4,930 Provision for income taxes is comprised of the following components: For Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Current Deferred Total Current Deferred Total Current Deferred Total U.S. federal $ 979 $ (98 ) $ 881 $ 2,101 $ 51 $ 2,152 $ 1,289 $ (122 ) $ 1,167 Non-U.S. 225 (8 ) 217 173 61 234 238 (80 ) 158 U.S. state 7 1 8 12 — 12 10 — 10 Total $ 1,211 $ (105 ) $ 1,106 $ 2,286 $ 112 $ 2,398 $ 1,537 $ (202 ) $ 1,335 Principal reconciling items from the U.S. statutory income tax rate to the effective tax rate (provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes) are as follows: For Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 U.S. statutory income tax rate 21.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % U.S. tax benefit for foreign derived intangible income (5.3 ) — — U.S. Tax Act transitional non-cash expense 4.2 — — U.S. Tax Act enactment-date effects and measurement period adjustments (0.7 ) 12.7 — U.S. tax on global intangible low-taxed income 0.4 — — U.S. tax benefit for manufacturing — (1.6 ) (1.5 ) U.S. excess tax benefit for stock compensation (2.0 ) (4.1 ) (3.0 ) U.S. R&D tax credit (1.3 ) (1.1 ) (1.2 ) U.S. non-deductible expenses 0.2 0.2 0.3 Non-U.S. effective tax rates 0.1 (2.5 ) (3.7 ) Impact of changes to uncertain tax positions — 0.7 0.6 Other (0.1 ) 0.1 0.6 Effective tax rate 16.5 % 39.4 % 27.1 % 40 The Tax Act was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act reduces the U.S. statutory income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and requires companies to pay a one-time tax on indefinitely reinvested earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred. We applied the guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 when accounting for the enactment-date effects of the Tax Act in 2017 and throughout 2018. As of December 31, 2017, we had not completed our accounting for the enactment-date income tax effects of the Tax Act for the following aspects: one-time tax on indefinitely reinvested earnings and the effects on our existing deferred tax balances. As of December 31, 2018, we completed our accounting for the enactment-date income tax effects of the Tax Act. We booked a provisional amount of $773 million in 2017 and reduced our provisional amount by $44 million in 2018, for a net of $729 million. The Tax Act also included the global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) tax for years beginning in 2018. We account for the effects of GILTI as a component of income tax expense in the period in which the tax arises. The earnings represented by non-cash operating assets, such as fixed assets and certain inventory, will continue to be permanently reinvested outside the United States. The tax on indefinitely reinvested earnings eliminates any additional U.S. taxation of these earnings upon repatriation to the United States. Consequently, no U.S. tax provision has been made for the future remittance of these earnings. However, withholding taxes in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions will be incurred upon repatriation of available cash to the United States. A provision has been made for deferred taxes on these undistributed earnings to the extent that dividend payments from these subsidiaries are expected to result in a withholding tax liability. As of December 31, 2018, we have no basis differences that would result in material unrecognized deferred tax liabilities. Our effective tax rate is affected by U.S. tax benefits and tax rates applicable to our operations in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate, most of which were lower than the U.S. statutory income tax rate prior to enactment of the Tax Act. These non-U.S. tax rates are generally statutory in nature and without expiration. The primary components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows: December 31, 2018 2017 Deferred tax assets: Deferred loss and tax credit carryforwards $ 247 $ 256 Accrued expenses 129 119 Stock compensation 122 107 Inventories and related reserves 107 93 Retirement costs for defined benefit and retiree health care 80 38 Other — 9 Total deferred tax assets, before valuation allowance 685 622 Valuation allowance (172 ) (165 ) Total deferred tax assets, after valuation allowance 513 457 Deferred tax liabilities: Acquisition-related intangibles and fair-value adjustments (142 ) (207 ) International earnings (43 ) (64 ) Other (75 ) — Total deferred tax liabilities (260 ) (271 ) Net deferred tax asset $ 253 $ 186 The deferred tax assets and liabilities based on tax jurisdictions are presented on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows: December 31, 2018 2017 Deferred tax assets $ 295 $ 264 Deferred tax liabilities (42 ) (78 ) Net deferred tax asset $ 253 $ 186 We make an ongoing assessment regarding the realization of U.S. and non-U.S. deferred tax assets. This assessment is based on our evaluation of relevant criteria, including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets, taxable income in prior carryback years and expectations for future taxable income. Valuation allowances increased by $7 million and $37 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. These changes had no impact to net income in 2018 or 2017. We have U.S. and non-U.S. tax loss carryforwards of approximately $6 million , none of which will expire before the year 2028. 41 Cash payments made for income taxes, net of refunds, were $ 7 0 5 m illion , $1.80 billion and $1.15 billion in 2018 , 2017 and 2016, respectively. Uncertain tax positions We operate in a number of tax jurisdictions, and our income tax returns are subject to examination by tax authorities in those jurisdictions who may challenge any item on these tax returns. Because the matters challenged by authorities are typically complex, their ultimate outcome is uncertain. Before any benefit can be recorded in our financial statements, we must determine that it is “more likely than not” that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate tax authorities. We recognize accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions and penalties as components of OI&E. The changes in the total amounts of uncertain tax positions are as follows: 2018 2017 2016 Balance, January 1 $ 300 $ 243 $ 84 Additions based on tax positions related to the current year 3 17 4 Additions for tax positions of prior years 1 42 189 Reductions for tax positions of prior years — (1 ) (2 ) Settlements with tax authorities (18 ) (1 ) (32 ) Balance, December 31 $ 286 $ 300 $ 243 Interest income (expense) recognized in the year ended December 31 $ (15 ) $ (19 ) $ 4 Interest receivable (payable) as of December 31 $ (49 ) $ (38 ) $ 13 The liability for uncertain tax positions is a component of other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. All of the $286 million and $300 million liabilities for uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, are comprised of positions that, if recognized, would lower the effective tax rate. If these liabilities are ultimately realized, $30 million and $13 million of existing deferred tax assets in 2018 and 2017, respectively, would also be realized. It is reasonably possible that the $286 million liability as of December 31, 2018, could decrease by up to $223 million in 2019 for the resolution of a tax depreciation-related position. As of December 31, 2018 , the statute of limitations remains open for U.S. federal tax returns for 2013 and following years. Audit activities related to our U.S. federal tax returns through 2012 have been completed except for certain pending tax treaty procedures for relief from double taxation. The procedures for relief from double taxation pertain to U.S. federal tax returns for the years 2006 through 2012. The audit of the U.S. federal tax returns for 2013 through 2015 is underway. In non-U.S. jurisdictions, the years open to audit represent the years still open under the statute of limitations. With respect to major jurisdictions outside the United States, our subsidiaries are no longer subject to income tax audits for years before 2007. 6. Financial instruments and risk concentration Financial instruments We hold derivative financial instruments such as forward foreign currency exchange contracts, the fair value of which was not material as of December 31, 2018 . Our forward foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2018 , had a notional value of $525 million to hedge our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures, including $ 160 million to sell Japanese yen, $99 million to sell euros and $94 million to sell Indian rupees. Our investments in cash equivalents, short-term investments and certain long-term investments, as well as our deferred compensation liabilities, are carried at fair value. Our postretirement plan assets are carried at fair value or net asset value per share. The carrying values for other current financial assets and liabilities, such as accounts receivable and accounts payable, approximate fair value due to the short maturity of such instruments. The carrying value of our long-term debt approximates the fair value as measured using broker-dealer quotes, which are Level 2 inputs. See Note 7 for a description of fair value and the definition of Level 2 inputs. 42 Risk concentration We are subject to counterparty risks from financial institutions, customers and issuers of debt securities. Financial instruments that could subject us to concentrations of credit risk are primarily cash deposits, cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable. To manage our credit risk exposure, we place cash investments in investment-grade debt securities and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. We also limit counterparties on cash deposits and financial derivative contracts to financial institutions with investment-grade ratings. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across different industries and geographic areas. We maintain allowances for expected returns, disputes, adjustments, incentives and collectability. These allowances are deducted from accounts receivable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Details of these accounts receivable allowances are as follows: 2018 2017 2016 Balance, January 1 $ 8 $ 17 $ 7 Amounts charged (credited) to operating results 11 (9 ) 10 Recoveries and write-offs, net — — — Balance, December 31 $ 19 $ 8 $ 17 Major customer No end customer accounted for 10 percent or more of revenue in 2018, 2017 or 2016. 7. Valuation of debt and equity investments and certain liabilities Debt and equity investments measured at fair value Available-for-sale debt investments and trading securities are stated at fair value, which is generally based on market prices or broker quotes. See Fair-value considerations below. Unrealized gains and losses from available-for-sale debt securities are recorded as an increase or decrease, net of taxes, in AOCI on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Other-than-temporary impairments on available-for-sale debt securities are recorded in OI&E in our Consolidated Statements of Income. We classify certain mutual funds as trading securities. These mutual funds hold a variety of debt and equity investments intended to generate returns that offset changes in certain deferred compensation liabilities. We record changes in the fair value of these mutual funds and the related deferred compensation liabilities in SG&A. Other equity investments Our other investments include equity-method investments and non-marketable equity investments, which are not measured at fair value. These investments consist of interests in venture capital funds and other non-marketable equity securities. Gains and losses from equity-method investments are recognized in OI&E based on our ownership share of the investee’s financial results. Non-marketable equity securities are measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments. Prior to our adoption of ASU 2016-01 in 2018, these securities were accounted for using the cost method of accounting, measured at cost less other-than-temporary impairment. Gains and losses on non-marketable equity investments are recognized in OI&E. 43 Details of our investments are as follows: December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Cash and Cash Short-Term Long-Term Cash and Cash Short-Term Long-Term Equivalents Investments Investments Equivalents Investments Investments Measured at fair value: Available-for-sale debt securities: Money market funds $ 747 $ — $ — $ 525 $ — $ — Corporate obligations 473 748 — 172 698 — U.S. government agency and Treasury securities 988 1,047 — 700 2,115 — Trading securities: Mutual funds — — 226 — — 236 Total 2,208 1,795 226 1,397 2,813 236 Other measurement basis: Equity-method investments — — 21 — — 26 Non-marketable equity investments — — 4 — — 6 Cash on hand 230 — — 259 — — Total $ 2,438 $ 1,795 $ 251 $ 1,656 $ 2,813 $ 268 As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, unrealized gains and losses associated with our available-for-sale investments were not material. We did not recognize any credit losses related to available-for-sale investments in 2018 , 2017 or 2016. In 2018 , 2017 and 2016, the proceeds from sales, redemptions and maturities of short-term available-for-sale investments were $6.71 billion , $4.10 billion and $3.39 billion , respectively. Gross realized gains and losses from these sales were not material. The following table presents the aggregate maturities of our available-for-sale debt investments as of December 31, 2018: Fair Value One year or less $ 3,838 One to two years 165 There were no other-than-temporary declines and impairments in the values of our debt investments in 2018, 2017 or 2016. Fair-value considerations We measure and report certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The three-level hierarchy discussed below indicates the extent and level of judgment used to estimate fair-value measurements. • Level 1 – Uses unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. • Level 2 – Uses inputs other than Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date through correlation with market data, including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and quoted prices in markets that are not active. Level 2 also includes assets and liabilities that are valued using models or other pricing methodologies that do not require significant judgment since the input assumptions used in the models, such as interest rates and volatility factors, are corroborated by readily observable data. We utilize a third-party data service to provide Level 2 valuations. We verify these valuations for reasonableness relative to unadjusted quotes obtained from brokers or dealers based on observable prices for similar assets in active markets. • Level 3 – Uses inputs that are unobservable, supported by little or no market activity and reflect the use of significant management judgment. These values are generally determined using pricing models that utilize management estimates of market participant assumptions. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had no Level 3 assets or liabilities, other than certain assets held by our postretirement plans. 44 The following are our assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis. These tables do not include cash on hand, assets held by our postretirement plans, or assets and liabilities that are measured at historical cost or any basis other than fair value.

Goodwill and acquisition-related intangibles Goodwill by segment as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, is as follows: Goodwill Analog $ 4,158 Embedded Processing 172 Other 32 Total $ 4,362 We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1 and determine whether the fair value of each of our reporting units is in excess of its carrying value. Determination of fair value is based upon management estimates and judgment, using unobservable inputs in discounted cash flow models to calculate the fair value of each reporting unit. These unobservable inputs are considered Level 3 measurements, as described in Note 7. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, we determined no impairment was indicated. The components of acquisition-related intangibles are as follows: Amortization December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Period Gross Carrying Accumulated Gross Carrying Accumulated (Years) Amount Amortization Net Amount Amortization Net Developed technology 7 - 10 $ 2,125 $ 1,573 $ 552 $ 2,130 $ 1,361 $ 769 Customer relationships 8 810 734 76 810 633 177 Total $ 2,935 $ 2,307 $ 628 $ 2,940 $ 1,994 $ 946 Acquisition charges Acquisition charges represent the ongoing amortization of intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of National Semiconductor Corporation.

Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles was $318 million , $318 million and $319 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Fully amortized assets are written off against accumulated amortization. Remaining estimated amortization is as follows: Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangibles 2019 $ 288 2020 198 2021 142 45 9. Postretirement benefit plans Plan descriptions We have various employee retirement plans, including defined contribution, defined benefit and retiree health care benefit plans. For qualifying employees, we offer deferred compensation arrangements. U.S. retirement plans Our principal retirement plans in the United States are a defined contribution plan; an enhanced defined contribution plan; and qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans. The defined benefit plans were closed to new participants in 1997, and then current participants were allowed to make a one-time election to continue accruing a benefit in the plans, or to cease accruing a benefit and instead to participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan described below. Both defined contribution plans offer an employer-matching savings option that allows employees to make pre-tax and post-tax contributions to various investment choices. Employees who elected to continue accruing a benefit in the qualified defined benefit pension plans may also participate in the defined contribution plan, where employer-matching contributions are provided for up to 2 percent of the employee’s annual eligible earnings. Employees who elected not to continue accruing a benefit in the defined benefit pension plans, and employees hired after November 1997 and through December 31, 2003, may participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan. This plan provides for a fixed employer contribution of 2 percent of the employee’s annual eligible earnings, plus an employer-matching contribution of up to 4 percent of the employee’s annual eligible earnings. Employees hired after December 31, 2003, do not receive the fixed employer contribution of 2 percent of the employee’s annual eligible earnings. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, as a result of employees’ elections, TI’s U.S. defined contribution plans held shares of TI common stock totaling 9 million shares and 10 million shares valued at $821 million and $1.00 billion , respectively. Dividends paid on these shares in 2018 and 2017 were $24 million and $22 million, respectively . Effective April 1, 2016, the TI common stock fund was frozen to new contributions or transfers into the fund. Our aggregate expense for the U.S. defined contribution plans was $61 million in 2018 and 2017 and $ 60 million in 2016. The defined benefit pension plans include employees still accruing benefits, as well as employees and participants who no longer accrue service-related benefits, but instead, may participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan. Benefits under the qualified defined benefit pension plan are determined using a formula based upon years of service and the highest five consecutive years of compensation. We intend to contribute amounts to this plan to meet the minimum funding requirements of applicable local laws and regulations, plus such additional amounts as we deem appropriate. The non-qualified defined benefit plans are unfunded and closed to new participants. U.S. retiree health care benefit plan U.S. employees who meet eligibility requirements are offered medical coverage during retirement. We make a contribution toward the cost of those retiree medical benefits for certain retirees and their dependents. The contribution rates are based upon various factors, the most important of which are an employee’s date of hire, date of retirement, years of service and eligibility for Medicare benefits. The balance of the cost is borne by the plan’s participants. Employees hired after January 1, 2001, are responsible for the full cost of their medical benefits during retirement. Non-U.S. retirement plans We provide retirement coverage for non-U.S. employees, as required by local laws or to the extent we deem appropriate, through a number of defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Retirement benefits are generally based on an employee’s years of service and compensation. Funding requirements are determined on an individual country and plan basis and are subject to local country practices and market circumstances. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, as a result of employees’ elections, TI’s non-U.S. defined contribution plans held TI common stock valued at $23 million and $27 million, respectively . Dividends paid on these shares of TI common stock in 2018 and 2017 were not material. 46 Effects on our Consolidated Statements of Income and Balance Sheets Expense related to defined benefit and retiree health care benefit plans is as follows: U.S. Defined Benefit U.S. Retiree Health Care Non-U.S. Defined Benefit 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 2016 Service cost $ 19 $ 22 $ 22 $ 5 $ 5 $ 5 $ 36 $ 37 $ 34 Interest cost 35 42 42 15 17 20 45 44 52 Expected return on plan assets (42 ) (41 ) (41 ) (15 ) (17 ) (20 ) (67 ) (62 ) (68 ) Amortization of prior service credit — — — (3 ) (4 ) (3 ) (1 ) (2 ) (2 ) Recognized net actuarial loss 17 14 21 2 3 7 20 28 25 Net periodic benefit costs 29 37 44 4 4 9 33 45 41 Settlement losses 23 36 21 — — — 3 2 2 Total, including other postretirement losses $ 52 $ 73 $ 65 $ 4 $ 4 $ 9 $ 36 $ 47 $ 43 All defined benefit and retiree health care benefit plan expense components other than service cost are recognized in OI&E in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Service cost is recognized within operating profit. For the U.S. qualified pension and retiree health care plans, the expected return on plan assets component of net periodic benefit cost is based upon a market-related value of assets. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the market-related value of assets is the fair value adjusted by a smoothing technique whereby certain gains and losses are phased in over a period of three years. Changes in the benefit obligations and plan assets for defined benefit and retiree health care benefit plans are as follows: U.S. U.S. Non-U.S. Defined Benefit Retiree Health Care Defined Benefit 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 Change in plan benefit obligation Benefit obligation at beginning of year: $ 998 $ 1,030 $ 414 $ 434 $ 2,469 $ 2,361 Service cost 19 22 5 5 36 37 Interest cost 35 42 15 17 45 44 Participant contributions — — 11 9 7 6 Benefits paid (10 ) (9 ) (41 ) (39 ) (87 ) (90 ) Settlements (100 ) (196 ) — — (16 ) (13 ) Actuarial loss (gain) (68 ) 109 (43 ) (15 ) 6 (52 ) Plan amendments — — — 3 7 — Effects of exchange rate changes — — — — (56 ) 176 Benefit obligation at end of year $ 874 $ 998 $ 361 $ 414 $ 2,411 $ 2,469 Change in plan assets Fair value of plan assets at beginning of year: $ 995 $ 1,034 $ 394 $ 434 $ 2,593 $ 2,309 Actual return on plan assets (56 ) 123 (12 ) 44 (52 ) 148 Employer contributions (qualified plans) 20 25 1 1 19 56 Employer contributions (non-qualified plans) 20 18 — — — — Participant contributions — — 11 9 7 6 Benefits paid (10 ) (9 ) (41 ) (39 ) (87 ) (90 ) Settlements (100 ) (196 ) — — (16 ) (13 ) Effects of exchange rate changes — — — — (54 ) 177 Other — — (23 ) (55 ) — — Fair value of plan assets at end of year $ 869 $ 995 $ 330 $ 394 $ 2,410 $ 2,593 Funded status at end of year $ (5 ) $ (3 ) $ (31 ) $ (20 ) $ (1 ) $ 124 47 Amounts recognized on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, a re as follows: U.S. Defined U.S. Retiree Non-U.S. Benefit Health Care Defined Benefit Total 2018 Overfunded retirement plans $ 40 $ — $ 52 $ 92 Accrued expenses and other liabilities & other long-term liabilities (8 ) — (3 ) (11 ) Underfunded retirement plans (37 ) (31 ) (50 ) (118 ) Funded status at end of 2018 $ (5 ) $ (31 ) $ (1 ) $ (37 ) 2017 Overfunded retirement plans $ 58 $ — $ 150 $ 208 Accrued expenses and other liabilities & other long-term liabilities (13 ) — (5 ) (18 ) Underfunded retirement plans (48 ) (20 ) (21 ) (89 ) Funded status at end of 2017 $ (3 ) $ (20 ) $ 124 $ 101 Contributions to the plans meet or exceed all minimum funding requirements. We expect to contribute about $50 million to our retirement benefit plans in 2019. The amounts shown for underfunded U.S. defined benefit plans were for non-qualified pension plans, which we do not fund because contributions to them are not tax deductible. Accumulated benefit obligations, which are generally less than the projected benefit obligations as they exclude the impact of future salary increases, were $793 million and $899 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, for the U.S. defined benefit plans, and $2.29 billion and $2.33 billion as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, for the non-U.S. defined benefit plans. The change in AOCI is as follows: U.S. Defined U.S. Retiree Non-U.S. Benefit Health Care Defined Benefit Total Net Actuarial Loss Net Actuarial Loss Prior Service Credit Net Actuarial Loss Prior Service Credit Net Actuarial Loss Prior Service Credit AOCI balance, net of taxes, December 31, 2017 $ 118 $ 29 $ (6 ) $ 247 $ (4 ) $ 394 $ (10 ) Changes in AOCI by category: Adjustments 29 (16 ) — 120 7 133 7 Recognized within net income (39 ) (2 ) 3 (24 ) 1 (65 ) 4 Tax effect 2 4 (1 ) (26 ) (1 ) (20 ) (2 ) Cumulative effect of accounting changes (a) 25 6 (1 ) — — 31 (1 ) Total change to AOCI 17 (8 ) 1 70 7 79 8 AOCI balance, net of taxes, December 31, 2018 $ 135 $ 21 $ (5 ) $ 317 $ 3 $ 473 $ (2 ) (a) Reflects the adoption of ASU 2018-02. See Note 2 for additional information. The estimated amounts of net actuarial loss and unrecognized prior service cost (credit) included in AOCI as of December 31, 2018 , that are expected to be amortized into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year are: $10 million and none for the U.S. defined benefit plans; none and ( $2) million for the U.S. retiree health care benefit plan; and $29 million and $1 million for the non-U.S. defined benefit plans. 48 Information on plan assets We report and measure the plan assets of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans at fair value. The tables below set forth the fair value of our plan assets using the same three-level hierarchy of fair-value inputs described in Note 7.

The investments in our major benefit plans largely consist of low-cost, broad-market index funds to mitigate risks of concentration within market sectors. Our investment policy is designed to better match the interest rate sensitivity of the plan assets and liabilities. The appropriate mix of equity and bond investments is determined primarily through the use of detailed asset-liability modeling studies that look to balance the impact of changes in the discount rate against the need to provide asset growth to cover future service cost. Most of our plans around the world have a greater proportion of fixed income securities with return characteristics that are more closely aligned with changes in the liabilities caused by discount rate volatility. For the U.S. plans, we utilize an option collar strategy to reduce the volatility of returns on certain investments in U.S. equity funds. The only Level 3 asset in our worldwide benefit plans for the periods presented is a diversified property fund in a non-U.S. pension plan. These investments are valued using inputs from the fund managers and internal models. Changes to the fair value of this fund since December 31, 2016, have not been material, and are due to redemptions. 49 Assumptions and investment policies U.S. U.S. Retiree Non-U.S. Defined Benefit Health Care Defined Benefit 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 Weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations: Discount rate 4.37% 3.75% 4.30% 3.63% 1.85% 1.84% Long-term pay progression 3.30% 3.30% n/a n/a 2.96% 2.96% Weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost: Discount rate 3.77% 4.21% 3.63% 4.08% 1.84% 1.76% Long-term rate of return on plan assets 4.80% 4.30% 4.10% 4.10% 2.58% 2.60% Long-term pay progression 3.30% 3.30% n/a n/a 2.96% 3.11% We utilize a variety of methods to select an appropriate discount rate depending on the depth of the corporate bond market in the country in which the benefit plan operates. In the United States, we use a settlement approach whereby a portfolio of bonds is selected from the universe of actively traded high-quality U.S. corporate bonds. The selected portfolio is designed to provide cash flows sufficient to pay the plan’s expected benefit payments when due. The resulting discount rate reflects the rate of return of the selected portfolio of bonds. For our non-U.S. locations with a sufficient number of actively traded high-quality bonds, an analysis is performed in which the projected cash flows from the defined benefit plans are discounted against a yield curve constructed with an appropriate universe of high-quality corporate bonds available in each country. In this manner, a present value is developed. The discount rate selected is the single equivalent rate that produces the same present value. For countries that lack a sufficient corporate bond market, a government bond index adjusted for an appropriate risk premium is used to establish the discount rate. Assumptions for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets are based on future expectations for returns for each asset class and the effect of periodic target asset allocation rebalancing. We adjust the results for the payment of reasonable expenses of the plan from plan assets. We believe our assumptions are appropriate based on the investment mix and long-term nature of the plans’ investments. Assumptions used for the non-U.S. defined benefit plans reflect the different economic environments within the various countries. The target allocation ranges for the plans that hold a substantial majority of the defined benefit assets are as follows: U.S. Defined U.S. Retiree Non-U.S. Benefit Health Care Defined Benefit Fixed income securities and cash equivalents 65% 55% - 65% 60% - 100% Equity securities 35% 35% - 45% 0% - 40% We rebalance the plans’ investments when they are not within the target allocation ranges. Weighted average asset allocations as of December 31 are as follows: U.S. Defined U.S. Retiree Non-U.S. Defined Benefit Health Care Benefit 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 Fixed income securities and cash equivalents 65% 66% 65% 62% 74% 71% Equity securities 35% 34% 35% 38% 26% 29% None of the plan assets related to the defined benefit pension plans and retiree health care benefit plan are directly invested in TI common stock. As of December 31, 2018 , we do not expect to return any of the defined benefit pension plans’ assets to TI in the next 12 months. 50 The following assumed future benefit payments to plan participants in the next 10 years are used to measure our benefit obligations. Almost all of the payments, which may vary significantly from these assumptions, will be made from plan assets and not from company assets. U.S. Defined U.S. Retiree Non-U.S. Benefit Health Care Defined Benefit 2019 $ 78 $ 32 $ 88 2020 105 31 90 2021 77 30 92 2022 79 29 95 2023 85 28 95 2024 – 2028 428 124 510 Assumed health care cost trend rates for the U.S. retiree health care benefit plan as of December 31 are as follows: 2018 2017 Assumed health care cost trend rate for next year 7.25 % 7.50 % Ultimate trend rate 5.00 % 5.00 % Year in which ultimate trend rate is reached 2028 2028 A one percentage point increase or decrease in health care cost trend rates over all future periods would have increased or decreased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the U.S. retiree health care benefit plan as of December 31, 2018 , by $1 million . The service cost and interest cost components of 2018 plan expense would have increased or decreased by less than $1 million . Deferred compensation arrangements We have a deferred compensation plan that allows U.S. employees whose base salary and management responsibility exceed a certain level to defer receipt of a portion of their cash compensation. Payments under this plan are made based on the participant’s distribution election and plan balance. Participants can earn a return on their deferred compensation based on notional investments in the same investment funds that are offered in our defined contribution plans. As of December 31, 2018 , our liability to participants of the deferred compensation plans was $246 million and is recorded in other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. This amount reflects the accumulated participant deferrals and earnings thereon as of that date. As of December 31, 2018, we held $226 million in mutual funds related to these plans that are recorded in long-term investments on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and serve as an economic hedge against changes in fair values of our other deferred compensation liabilities. We record changes in the fair value of the liability and the related investment in SG&A as discussed in Note 7. 10. Debt and lines of credit Short-term borrowings We maintain a line of credit to support commercial paper borrowings, if any, and to provide additional liquidity through bank loans. As of December 31, 2018 , we had a variable-rate revolving credit facility from a consortium of investment-grade banks that allows us to borrow up to $2 billion until March 2023. The interest rate on borrowings under this credit facility, if drawn, is indexed to the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). As of December 31, 2018 , our credit facility was undrawn, and we had no commercial paper outstanding. Long-term debt We retired $500 million of maturing debt in May 2018. In the second quarter of 2018, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $1.5 billion of fixed-rate, long-term debt due in 2048, comprised of the issuance of $1.3 billion in May 2018 and an additional $200 million in June 2018. We incurred $16 million of issuance and other related costs. The proceeds of the offering were $1.5 billion, net of the original issuance discount and premium, and were used for general corporate purposes. We retired $250 million of maturing debt in March 2017 and another $375 million in June 2017. 51 In May 2017, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $600 million of fixed-rate, long-term debt. The offering consisted of the reissuance of $300 million of 2.75% notes due in 2021 at a premium and the issuance of $300 million of 2.625% notes due in 2024 at a discount. We incurred $3 million of iss uance and other related costs. The proceeds of the offerings were $605 million, net of the original issuance discount and premium, and were used for the repayment of maturing debt and general corporate purposes. In November 2017, we issued a principal amount of $500 million of fixed-rate, long-term debt due in 2027. We incurred $3 million of issuance and other related costs. The proceeds of the offering were $494 million, net of the original issuance discount, and were used for general corporate purposes. In May 2016, we issued a principal amount of $500 million of fixed-rate, long-term debt due in 2022. We incurred $3 million of issuance and other related costs. The proceeds of the offering were $499 million, net of the original issuance discount, and were used toward the repayment of a portion of $1.0 billion of maturing debt retired in May 2016. Long-term debt outstanding is as follows: December 31, 2018 2017 Notes due 2018 at 1.00% $ — $ 500 Notes due 2019 at 1.65% 750 750 Notes due 2020 at 1.75% 500 500 Notes due 2021 at 2.75% 550 550 Notes due 2022 at 1.85% 500 500 Notes due 2023 at 2.25% 500 500 Notes due 2024 at 2.625% 300 300 Notes due 2027 at 2.90% 500 500 Notes due 2048 at 4.15% 1,500 — Total debt 5,100 4,100 Net unamortized discounts, premiums and issuance costs (32 ) (23 ) Total debt, including net unamortized discounts, premiums and issuance costs 5,068 4,077 Current portion of long-term debt (749 ) (500 ) Long-term debt $ 4,319 $ 3,577 Interest and debt expense was $125 million , $78 million and $ 80 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This was net of the amortized discounts, premiums and issuance costs. Cash payments for interest on long-term debt were $114 million, $75 million and $88 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Capitalized interest was not material. 11. Commitments and contingencies Purchase commitments Some of our purchase commitments include payments for software licenses and contractual agreements with suppliers where there is a fixed, non-cancellable payment schedule or minimum payments due with a reduced delivery schedule. Operating leases We conduct certain operations in leased facilities and also lease a portion of our data processing and other equipment. In addition, certain long-term supply agreements to purchase industrial gases are accounted for as operating leases. Lease agreements frequently include purchase and renewal provisions and require us to pay taxes, insurance and maintenance costs. Rental and lease expense incurred was $ 79 million , $ 81 million and $ 86 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 52 As of December 31, 2018 , we had committed to make the following minim um payments under our purchase commitments and non-cancellable operating leases: Purchase Operating Commitments Leases 2019 $ 389 $ 56 2020 339 46 2021 130 36 2022 22 29 2023 15 18 Thereafter 15 39 Indemnification guarantees We routinely sell products with an intellectual property indemnification included in the terms of sale. Historically, we have had only minimal, infrequent losses associated with these indemnities. Consequently, we cannot reasonably estimate any future liabilities that may result. Warranty costs/product liabilities We accrue for known product-related claims if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. During the periods presented, there have been no material accruals or payments regarding product warranty or product liability. Historically, we have experienced a low rate of payments on product claims. Although we cannot predict the likelihood or amount of any future claims, we do not believe they will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Our stated warranties for semiconductor products obligate us to repair, replace or credit the purchase price of a covered product back to the buyer. Product claim consideration may exceed the price of our products. General We are subject to various legal and administrative proceedings. Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of these matters, we believe that the results of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 12. Restructuring charges/other Restructuring charges/other are included in Other for segment reporting purposes and are comprised of the following components: For Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Restructuring charges (a) $ 6 $ 11 $ 25 Gains on sales of assets (3 ) — (40 ) Restructuring charges/other $ 3 $ 11 $ (15 ) (a) Includes severance and benefits, accelerated depreciation, changes in estimates or other exit costs.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 22, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1952. Dallas, Texas February 22, 2019 56 ITEM 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. Not applicable. ITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures. Disclosure controls and procedures An evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of TI’s management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of TI’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based upon that evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that those disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Internal control over financial reporting Report by management on internal control over financial reporting The management of TI is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. TI’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements issued for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2018 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. TI management assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria) in Internal Control − Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2018, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on the COSO criteria. TI’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which immediately follows this report. 57 Report of independent registered public accounting firm on internal control over financ ial reporting To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Texas Instruments Incorporated Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited Texas Instruments Incorporated’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Texas Instruments Incorporated (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of Texas Instruments Incorporated as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes, and our report dated February 22, 2019 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon . Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying report by management on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

These forward-looking statements generally can be identified by phrases such as TI or its management “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “foresees,” “forecasts,” “estimates” or other words or phrases of similar import. Similarly, statements herein that describe TI’s business strategy, outlook, objectives, plans, intentions or goals also are forward-looking statements. All such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements. We urge you to carefully consider the following important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations of TI or our management: • Market demand for semiconductors, particularly in our end markets; • Our ability to compete in products and prices in an intensely competitive industry; • Customer demand that differs from forecasts and the financial impact of inadequate or excess company inventory that results from demand that differs from projections; • Economic, social and political conditions in the countries in which we, our customers or our suppliers operate, including security risks; global trade policies; political and social instability; health conditions; possible disruptions in transportation, communications and information technology networks; and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; • Evolving cybersecurity threats to our information technology systems or those of our customers or suppliers; • Natural events such as severe weather, geological events or health epidemics in the locations in which we, our customers or our suppliers operate; • Our ability to develop, manufacture and market innovative products in a rapidly changing technological environment; • Timely implementation of new manufacturing technologies and installation of manufacturing equipment, and the ability to obtain needed third-party foundry and assembly/test subcontract services; • Availability and cost of raw materials, utilities, manufacturing equipment, third-party manufacturing services and manufacturing technology; • Product liability or warranty claims, claims based on epidemic or delivery failure, or other claims relating to our products, manufacturing, services, design or communications, or recalls by our customers for a product containing one of our parts; • Compliance with or changes in the complex laws, rules and regulations to which we are or may become subject, or actions of enforcement authorities, that restrict our ability to manufacture or ship our products or operate our business, or subject us to fines, penalties or other legal liability; • Changes in tax law and accounting standards that can impact the tax rate applicable to us, the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed, adverse resolution of tax audits, increases in tariff rates, and the ability to realize deferred tax assets; • A loss suffered by one of our customers or distributors with respect to TI-consigned inventory; • Financial difficulties of our distributors or their promotion of competing product lines to our detriment, or the loss of significant distributors; • Losses or curtailments of purchases from key customers or the timing and amount of distributor and other customer inventory adjustments; • Our ability to maintain or improve profit margins, including our ability to utilize our manufacturing facilities at sufficient levels to cover our fixed operating costs, in an intensely competitive and cyclical industry and despite changes in the regulatory environment; • Our ability to maintain and enforce a strong intellectual property portfolio and maintain freedom of operation in all jurisdictions where we conduct business; or our exposure to infringement claims; • Instability in the global credit and financial markets that affects our ability to fund our daily operations, invest in the business, make strategic acquisitions, or make principal and interest payments on our debt; 63 • Increases in health care and pension benefit costs; • Our ability to recruit and retain skilled engineering, management and technical personnel, and effectively manage key employee succession; • Our ability to successfully integrate and realize opportunities for growth from acquisitions, or our ability to realize our expectations regarding the amount and timing of restructuring charges and associated cost savings; and • Impairments of our non-financial assets. For a more detailed discussion of these factors see the Risk Factors discussion in Item 1A of this report. The forward-looking statements included in this report are made only as of the date of this report, and we undertake no obligation to update the forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. 64 SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.
