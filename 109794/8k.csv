Management believes that these measures provide useful information to investors by offering additional ways of viewing Danaher Corporation’s (“Danaher” or the “Company”) results that, when reconciled to sales growth, help our investors identify underlying growth trends in our business and compare our sales performance with prior and future periods and to our peers. Management uses core sales growth and base business core sales growth to measure the Company’s financial performance, and uses core sales growth in the Company’s executive compensation program. We expect overall demand for the Company’s COVID-19 related products to continue moderating as the pandemic has evolved toward endemic status. We believe certain demand for the Company’s products that support COVID-19 related vaccines and therapeutics (including initiatives that seek to prevent or mitigate similar, future pandemics) and COVID-19 testing (which includes solutions that test for COVID-19 and other respiratory illnesses simultaneously) will continue, though that demand will likely be uncertain and will vary from period to period. At the beginning of 2022, the Company believed that on a relative basis, the level of ongoing demand for products supporting COVID-19 testing would be subject to more fluctuations in demand than the level of demand for products supporting COVID-19 related vaccines and therapeutics, due in part to expected COVID-19 case levels, vaccination rates and use of therapies. However, as a result of lower vaccination rates and the spread of less severe variants of the virus, 2022 demand for the Company’s products supporting COVID-19 related vaccines and therapeutics fluctuated and declined more than anticipated at the beginning of the year. Therefore, beginning with the first quarter of 2023, we have revised the definition of “base business core sales growth” on a basis that not only excludes revenues related to COVID-19 testing but also excludes revenues from products that support COVID-19 related vaccines and therapeutics. We believe this adjusted definition of “base business core sales growth” provides more useful information to investors by facilitating period-to-period comparisons of our financial performance and identifying underlying growth trends in the Company’s business that otherwise may be obscured by fluctuations in demand for COVID-19 related products. With respect to these non-GAAP measures, we also exclude (1) the impact of currency translation because it is not under management’s control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends, and (2) the effect of acquisitions and divested product lines because the timing, size, number and nature of such transactions can vary significantly from period-to-period and between us and our peers, which we believe may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult. 3 -;-EX-99.1PRE:EX-99.1PRE 3 ex991pre-selecteddanaher.htm EX-99.1PRE ex991pre-selecteddanaher 1 Forward Looking Statements Statements in this presentation that are not strictly historical, including any statements regarding Danaher’s anticipated financial performance and any other statements regarding events or developments that we believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future are ""forward looking"" statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.

Bedford, Vice President, Investor Relations, investor.relations@danaher.com Danaher Corporation, 2200 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Suite 800W, Washington, D.C. 20037, Telephone: (202) 828-0850, Fax: (202) 828-0860 2 Estimated Sales Decline, Core Sales Decline and Base Business Core Sales Decline % Estimated Change Three-Month Period Ended December 31, 2023 vs. Comparable 2022 Period Total sales decline (GAAP) -Low-double digit Impact of: Acquisitions/divestitures -Essentially flat Currency exchange rates -Low-single digit Core sales decline (non-GAAP) -Low-double digit Impact of COVID-19 related testing, vaccines and therapeutics +Mid-single digit/High-single digit Base business core sales decline (non-GAAP) -Mid-single digit Statement Regarding Non-GAAP Measures Core sales growth (and the related measure “base business core sales growth”) should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, sales growth, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes that these measures provide useful information to investors by offering additional ways of viewing Danaher Corporation’s (“Danaher” or the “Company”) results that, when reconciled to sales growth, help our investors identify underlying growth trends in our business and compare our sales performance with prior and future periods and to our peers. Management uses core sales growth and base business core sales growth to measure the Company’s financial performance, and uses core sales growth in the Company’s executive compensation program. We expect overall demand for the Company’s COVID-19 related products to continue moderating as the pandemic has evolved toward endemic status. We believe certain demand for the Company’s products that support COVID-19 related vaccines and therapeutics (including initiatives that seek to prevent or mitigate similar, future pandemics) and COVID-19 testing (which includes solutions that test for COVID-19 and other respiratory illnesses simultaneously) will continue, though that demand will likely be uncertain and will vary from period to period. At the beginning of 2022, the Company believed that on a relative basis, the level of ongoing demand for products supporting COVID-19 testing would be subject to more fluctuations in demand than the level of demand for products supporting COVID-19 related vaccines and therapeutics, due in part to expected COVID-19 case levels, vaccination rates and use of therapies. However, as a result of lower vaccination rates and the spread of less severe variants of the virus, 2022 demand for the Company’s products supporting COVID-19 related vaccines and therapeutics fluctuated and declined more than anticipated at the beginning of the year. Therefore, beginning with the first quarter of 2023, we have revised the definition of “base business core sales growth” on a basis that not only excludes revenues related to COVID-19 testing but also excludes revenues from products that support COVID-19 related vaccines and therapeutics. We believe this adjusted definition of “base business core sales growth” provides more useful information to investors by facilitating period-to-period comparisons of our financial performance and identifying underlying growth trends in the Company’s business that otherwise may be obscured by fluctuations in demand for COVID-19 related products. With respect to these non-GAAP measures, we also exclude (1) the impact of currency translation because it is not under management’s control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends, and (2) the effect of acquisitions and divested product lines because the timing, size, number and nature of such transactions can vary significantly from period-to-period and between us and our peers, which we believe may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult. 3 "

DANAHER CORPORATION Date: October 23, 2023 By: /s/ Matthew R. McGrew Matthew R. McGrew Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer -;-EX-99:EX-99 2 dhr-20231023xex991.htm EX-99 Document Exhibit 99.1 Danaher Reports Third Quarter 2023 Results WASHINGTON, D.C., October 24, 2023 -- Danaher Corporation (NYSE: DHR) (the “Company”) today announced results for the third quarter ended September 29, 2023. Net earnings refer to net earnings attributable to common shareholders. Results for the third quarter include the operations of Veralto Corporation, which was spun-off to Danaher's shareholders on September 30, 2023. Key Third Quarter 2023 Results • Net earnings were $1.1 billion, or $1.51 per diluted common share and non-GAAP adjusted diluted net earnings per common share were $2.02. • Revenues decreased 10.5% year-over-year to $6.9 billion. • Non-GAAP core revenue decreased 11.5%, including a 3.0% non-GAAP base business core revenue decline. • Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $1.7 billion and non-GAAP free cash flow was $1.3 billion. Rainer M. Blair, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “Revenue in the third quarter came in ahead of our expectations, with Biotechnology performing as anticipated, and higher respiratory testing revenue more than offsetting slightly softer-than-anticipated demand in Life Sciences. DBS-driven execution also enabled us to deliver better-than-expected earnings and cash flow in what remains a challenging operating environment.” Blair continued, “We also successfully completed the spin-off of Veralto. Going forward, Danaher is dedicated to accelerating the power of science and technology to improve human health. With our differentiated portfolio and commitment to continuous improvement, we have a unique opportunity to help solve many of the world's most critical health care challenges while building meaningful long-term shareholder value.” Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Outlook The Company provides forecasted sales only on a non-GAAP basis because of the difficulty in estimating the other components of GAAP revenue, such as currency translation, acquisitions and divested product lines. The Company’s fourth quarter and full year outlook include only Danaher’s continuing operations, excluding the impact of Veralto. For the fourth quarter 2023, the Company anticipates that non-GAAP base business core revenue from continuing operations will be down mid-single digits year-over-year. For full year 2023, the Company anticipates that non-GAAP base business core revenue from continuing operations will be down slightly year-over-year.

Notes to Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures A Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets in the following historical periods (only the pretax amounts set forth below are reflected in the amortization line item above): Three-Month Period Ended Nine-Month Period Ended September 29, 2023 September 30, 2022 September 29, 2023 September 30, 2022 Pretax $ 379 $ 361 $ 1,147 $ 1,120 After-tax 306 293 926 904 B Net (gains) losses on the Company's equity and limited partnership investments recorded in the following historical periods (only the pretax amounts set forth below are reflected in the fair value net (gains) losses on investments line above): Three-Month Period Ended Nine-Month Period Ended September 29, 2023 September 30, 2022 September 29, 2023 September 30, 2022 Pretax $ 48 $ 64 $ 58 $ 186 After-tax 36 48 44 141 C Costs incurred in the three and nine-month periods ended September 29, 2023 related to preparation for the separation of the Company’s Environmental & Applied Solutions business, primarily related to professional fees for legal, tax, finance, banking and information technology services and duplicative general and administrative costs ($36 million and $101 million pretax as reported in this line item, and $31 million and $90 million after-tax, respectively). D Impairment charges related to a trade name in the Environmental & Applied Solutions segment recorded in the three-month period ended September 29, 2023 ($6 million pretax as reported in this line item, $4 million after-tax). Impairment charges related to technology and other assets in the Biotechnology segment and customer relationships and a trade name in the Environmental & Applied Solutions segment recorded in the nine-month period ended September 29, 2023 ($54 million pretax as reported in this line item, $41 million after-tax). Impairment charges related to technology and customer relationships in the Environmental & Applied Solutions segment recorded in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 ($9 million pretax as reported in this line item, $7 million after-tax). Additionally, in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022, charges incurred primarily related to impairments of accounts receivable and inventory as well as accruals for contractual obligations in Russia ($43 million pretax as reported in this line item, $40 million after-tax). 5 DANAHER CORPORATION RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (continued) E Loss on a partial settlement of a defined benefit plan as a result of the transfer of a portion of the Company’s non-U.S. pension liabilities related to one defined benefit plan to a third-party in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 ($10 million pretax as reported in this line item, $9 million after-tax). F This line item reflects the aggregate tax effect of all nontax adjustments reflected in the preceding line items of the table. In addition, the footnotes above indicate the after-tax amount of each individual adjustment item. Danaher estimates the tax effect of each adjustment item by applying Danaher’s overall estimated effective tax rate to the pretax amount, unless the nature of the item and/or the tax jurisdiction in which the item has been recorded requires application of a specific tax rate or tax treatment, in which case the tax effect of such item is estimated by applying such specific tax rate or tax treatment. The MCPS dividends are not tax deductible and therefore the tax effect of the adjustments does not include any tax impact of the MCPS dividends. G There were no net discrete tax adjustments and other tax-related adjustments for the three-month period ended September 29, 2023, as discrete tax benefits from excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation were offset by charges related to tax costs related to the separation of the Environmental & Applied Solutions business and changes in estimates associated with prior period uncertain tax positions. Discrete tax adjustments and other tax-related adjustments for the nine-month period ended September 29, 2023, include the impact of a net discrete tax loss of $13 million related primarily to tax costs related to the separation of the Environmental & Applied Solutions business and tax costs related to legal and operational actions taken to realign certain businesses and changes in estimates associated with prior period uncertain tax positions, partially offset by excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and interest on prior year tax refunds. Discrete tax adjustments and other tax-related adjustments for the three-month period ended September 30, 2022, include the impact of net discrete tax benefits of $3 million related primarily to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation partially offset by changes in estimates associated with prior period uncertain tax positions. Discrete tax adjustments and other tax-related adjustments for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022, include the impact of net discrete tax benefits of $52 million related primarily to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and changes in estimates associated with prior period uncertain tax positions.

As of April 17, 2023, all outstanding shares of the MCPS Series B converted into 8.6 million shares of the Company’s common stock. The impact of the MCPS Series A calculated under the if-converted method was dilutive for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022, and as such 4.0 million shares underlying the MCPS Series A were included in the calculation of diluted EPS. The related MCPS Series A dividends of $20 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 were excluded from the calculation of net earnings for diluted EPS. On April 15, 2022, all outstanding shares of the MCPS Series A converted into 11.0 million shares of the Company’s common stock. 3 The number of converted shares assumes the conversion of all MCPS and issuance of the underlying shares applying the “if-converted” method of accounting and using the actual conversion rates for the nine-month period ended September 29, 2023 and an average 20 trading-day trailing Volume Weighted Average Price of $274.64 as of September 30, 2022. 6 DANAHER CORPORATION RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (continued) Sales (Decline) Growth by Segment, Core Sales (Decline) Growth by Segment and Base Business Core Sales (Decline) Growth by Segment % Change Three-Month Period Ended September 29, 2023 vs. Comparable 2022 Period Segments Total Company Biotechnology Life Sciences Diagnostics Environmental & Applied Solutions Total sales (decline) growth (GAAP) (10.5) % (19.0) % (1.0) % (16.0) % 3.5 % Impact of: Acquisitions/divestitures (0.5) % (0.5) % (1.0) % — % (0.5) % Currency exchange rates (0.5) % (1.5) % (0.5) % 0.5 % (2.0) % Core sales (decline) growth (non-GAAP) (11.5) % (21.0) % (2.5) % (15.5) % 1.0 % Impact of COVID-19 related testing, vaccines and therapeutics 8.5 % +Mid-single digit +Up slightly +Low-twenties — % Base business core sales (decline) growth (non-GAAP) (3.0) % -Mid-teens -Low-single digit +Mid-single digit 1.0 % % Change Nine-Month Period Ended September 29, 2023 vs. Comparable 2022 Period Segments Total Company Biotechnology Life Sciences Diagnostics Environmental & Applied Solutions Total sales (decline) growth (GAAP) (8.0) % (17.0) % 2.5 % (13.0) % 3.5 % Impact of: Acquisitions/divestitures (0.5) % — % (1.0) % — % (0.5) % Currency exchange rates 1.0 % 0.5 % 1.0 % 1.5 % — % Core sales (decline) growth (non-GAAP) (7.5) % (16.5) % 2.5 % (11.5) % 3.0 % Impact of COVID-19 related testing, vaccines and therapeutics 9.0 % +High-single digit +Low-single digit +Low-twenties — % Base business core sales growth (decline) (non-GAAP) 1.5 % -High-single digit +Mid-single digit +High-single digit 3.0 % Note: We expect overall demand for the Company’s COVID-19 related products to continue moderating as the pandemic has evolved toward endemic status. We believe certain demand for the Company’s products that support COVID-19 related vaccines and therapeutics (including initiatives that seek to prevent or mitigate similar, future pandemics) and COVID-19 testing will continue, though that demand will likely be uncertain and will vary from period to period. At the beginning of 2022, the Company believed that on a relative basis, the level of ongoing demand for products supporting COVID-19 testing would be subject to more fluctuations in demand than the level of demand for products supporting COVID-19 related vaccines and therapeutics, due in part to expected COVID-19 case levels, vaccination rates and use of therapies. However, as a result of lower vaccination rates and the spread of less severe variants of the virus, 2022 demand for the Company’s products supporting COVID-19 related vaccines and therapeutics fluctuated and declined more than anticipated at the beginning of the year. Therefore, beginning with the first quarter of 2023, we have revised the definition of “base business core sales growth” on a basis that not only excludes revenues related to COVID-19 testing but also excludes revenues from products that support COVID-19 related vaccines and therapeutics. We believe this adjusted definition of “base business core sales growth” provides more useful information to investors by facilitating period-to-period comparisons of our financial performance and identifying underlying growth trends in the Company’s business that otherwise may be obscured by fluctuations in demand for COVID-19 related products.

The reporting of Veralto as a discontinued operation will be reflected in the Company’s future filings, but in no way revises or restates any Consolidated Statements of Earnings for any period previously filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 7 DANAHER CORPORATION RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (continued) Operating Profit Margins and Year-Over-Year Core Operating Profit Margin Changes Segments Total Company Biotechnology Life Sciences Diagnostics Environmental & Applied Solutions Three-Month Period Ended September 30, 2022 Operating Profit Margins (GAAP) 26.30 % 33.70 % 20.50 % 28.40 % 23.70 % Third quarter 2023 impact from operating profit margins of businesses that have been owned for less than one year (0.05) 0.05 (0.25) (0.05) 0.10 Third quarter 2023 impairment charges related to a trade name in the Environmental & Applied Solutions segment (0.10) — — — (0.50) Third quarter 2023 costs incurred related to preparation for the separation of the Company's Environmental & Applied Solutions business (0.55) — — — — Year-over-year core operating profit margin changes for the third quarter 2023 (defined as all year-over-year operating profit margin changes other than the changes identified in the line items above) (non-GAAP) (4.70) (8.65) (1.95) (4.45) (0.40) Three-Month Period Ended September 29, 2023 Operating Profit Margins (GAAP) 20.90 % 25.10 % 18.30 % 23.90 % 22.90 % Segments Total Company Biotechnology Life Sciences Diagnostics Environmental & Applied Solutions Nine-Month Period Ended September 30, 2022 Operating Profit Margins (GAAP) 27.70 % 35.40 % 20.10 % 31.00 % 23.10 % First nine months of 2023 impact from operating profit margins of businesses that have been owned for less than one year or were disposed of during such period and did not qualify as discontinued operations (0.10) (0.10) (0.35) (0.05) 0.10 Second quarter 2023 impairment charges related to technology and other assets in the Biotechnology segment and customer relationships in the Environmental & Applied Solutions segment and third quarter 2023 impairment charge related to a trade name in the Environmental & Applied Solutions segment, net of a second quarter 2022 impairment charge related to technology and customer relationships in the Environmental & Applied Solutions segment (0.20) (0.80) — — (0.05) First nine months of 2023 costs incurred related to preparation for the separation of the Company's Environmental & Applied Solutions business (0.45) — — — — First nine months of 2022 impairments of accounts receivable and inventory as well as accruals for contractual obligations in Russia 0.15 0.20 0.50 0.05 — Year-over-year core operating profit margin changes for first nine months of 2023 (defined as all year-over-year operating profit margin changes other than the changes identified in the line items above) (non-GAAP) (5.10) (7.10) (1.55) (7.10) 0.75 Nine-Month Period Ended September 29, 2023 Operating Profit Margins (GAAP) 22.00 % 27.60 % 18.70 % 23.90 % 23.90 % 8 DANAHER CORPORATION RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (continued) Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow ($ in millions) Three-Month Period Ended Year-over-Year Change September 29, 2023 September 30, 2022 Total Cash Flow: Net cash provided by operating activities (GAAP) $ 1,672 $ 2,010 Total cash used in investing activities (GAAP) $ (329) $ (515) Total cash provided by (used in) financing activities (GAAP) $ 2,443 $ (230) Free Cash Flow: Net cash provided by operating activities (GAAP) $ 1,672 $ 2,010 ~ (17.0) % Less: payments for additions to property, plant & equipment (capital expenditures) (GAAP) (365) (277) Plus: proceeds from sales of property, plant & equipment (capital disposals) (GAAP) 4 — Free cash flow (non-GAAP) $ 1,311 $ 1,733 ~ (24.5) % We define free cash flow as operating cash flows, less payments for additions to property, plant and equipment (“capital expenditures”) plus the proceeds from sales of plant, property and equipment (“capital disposals”). 9 Statement Regarding Non-GAAP Measures Each of the non-GAAP measures set forth above should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, the comparable GAAP measure, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes that these measures provide useful information to investors by offering additional ways of viewing Danaher Corporation’s (“Danaher” or the “Company”) results that, when reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measure, help our investors: • with respect to Adjusted Diluted Net Earnings Per Common Share, understand the long-term profitability trends of our business and compare our profitability to prior and future periods and to our peers; • with respect to core sales and related non-GAAP sales measures, identify underlying growth trends in our business and compare our sales performance with prior and future periods and to our peers; and • with respect to free cash flow and related non-GAAP cash flow measures (the “FCF Measure”), understand Danaher’s ability to generate cash without external financings, strengthen its balance sheet, invest in its business and grow its business through acquisitions and other strategic opportunities (although a limitation of free cash flow is that it does not take into account the Company’s debt service requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures, and as a result the entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures). We expect overall demand for the Company’s COVID-19 related products to continue moderating as the pandemic has evolved toward endemic status. We believe certain demand for the Company’s products that support COVID-19 related vaccines and therapeutics (including initiatives that seek to prevent or mitigate similar, future pandemics) and COVID-19 testing will continue, though that demand will likely be uncertain and will vary from period to period. At the beginning of 2022, the Company believed that on a relative basis, the level of ongoing demand for products supporting COVID-19 testing would be subject to more fluctuations in demand than the level of demand for products supporting COVID-19 related vaccines and therapeutics, due in part to expected COVID-19 case levels, vaccination rates and use of therapies. However, as a result of lower vaccination rates and the spread of less severe variants of the virus, 2022 demand for the Company’s products supporting COVID-19 related vaccines and therapeutics fluctuated and declined more than anticipated at the beginning of the year. Therefore, beginning with the first quarter of 2023, we have revised the definition of “base business core sales growth” on a basis that not only excludes revenues related to COVID-19 testing but also excludes revenues from products that support COVID-19 related vaccines and therapeutics. We believe this adjusted definition of “base business core sales growth” provides more useful information to investors by facilitating period-to-period comparisons of our financial performance and identifying underlying growth trends in the Company’s business that otherwise may be obscured by fluctuations in demand for COVID-19 related products. Management uses the non-GAAP measures referenced above to measure the Company’s operating and financial performance, and uses core sales and non-GAAP measures similar to Adjusted Diluted Net Earnings Per Common Share and the FCF Measure in the Company’s executive compensation program. The items excluded from the non-GAAP measures set forth above have been excluded for the following reasons: • With respect to Adjusted Diluted Net Earnings Per Common Share: ◦ Amortization of Intangible Assets: We exclude the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because the amount and timing of such charges are significantly impacted by the timing, size, number and nature of the acquisitions we consummate. While we have a history of significant acquisition activity we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, and the amount of an acquisition’s purchase price allocated to intangible assets and related amortization term are unique to each acquisition and can vary significantly from acquisition to acquisition. Exclusion of this amortization expense facilitates more consistent comparisons of operating results over time between our newly acquired and long-held businesses, and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies. We believe however that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to sales generation and that intangible asset amortization related to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. ◦ Restructuring Charges: We exclude costs incurred pursuant to discrete restructuring plans that are fundamentally different (in terms of the size, strategic nature and planning requirements, as well as the inconsistent frequency, of such plans) from the ongoing productivity improvements that result from application of the Danaher Business System. Because these restructuring plans are incremental to the core activities that arise in the ordinary course of our business and we believe are not indicative of Danaher’s ongoing operating costs in a given period, we exclude these costs to facilitate a more consistent comparison of operating results over time. 10 ◦ Other Adjustments: With respect to the other items excluded from Adjusted Diluted Net Earnings Per Common Share, we exclude these items because they are of a nature and/or size that occur with inconsistent frequency, occur for reasons that may be unrelated to Danaher's commercial performance during the period and/or we believe that such items may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult. For example, we excluded the first quarter 2022 charge for asset impairments, accruals for contractual obligations and similar items related to our Russia operations because, even though it is possible we could incur additional charges in the future, we do not believe these charges are indicative of Danaher’s ongoing operating costs. • With respect to adjusted average common stock and common equivalent shares outstanding, Danaher’s Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (“MCPS”) Series A converted into Danaher common stock on April 15, 2022 and the MCPS Series B mandatorily converted into Danaher common stock on the mandatory conversion date of April 17, 2023 (unless converted or redeemed earlier in accordance with the terms of the applicable certificate of designations). With respect to the calculation of Adjusted Diluted Net Earnings Per Common Share, we apply the “if converted” method of share dilution to the MCPS Series A and B in all applicable periods irrespective of whether such preferred shares would be dilutive or anti-dilutive in the period. We believe this presentation provides useful information to investors by helping them understand the net impact on Danaher’s earnings per share-related measures irrespective of the period. • With respect to core sales related measures, (1) we exclude the impact of currency translation because it is not under management’s control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends, and (2) we exclude the effect of acquisitions and divested product lines because the timing, size, number and nature of such transactions can vary significantly from period-to-period and between us and our peers, which we believe may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult. • With respect to the FCF Measure, we exclude payments for additions to property, plant and equipment (net of the proceeds from capital disposals) to demonstrate the amount of operating cash flow for the period that remains after accounting for the Company’s capital expenditure requirements. The Company provides forecasted sales only on a non-GAAP basis because of the difficulty in estimating the other components of GAAP revenue, such as currency translation, acquisitions and divested product lines. 11 -;-",0000313616,DHR,"8-K:8-K 1 dhr-20231024.htm 8-K dhr-20231024 false 0000313616 0000313616 2023-10-24 2023-10-24 0000313616 us-gaap:CommonStockMember 2023-10-24 2023-10-24 0000313616 dhr:A1.7SeniorNotesDue2024Member 2023-10-24 2023-10-24 0000313616 dhr:A0.2SeniorNotesDue2026Member 2023-10-24 2023-10-24 0000313616 dhr:A2.1SeniorNotesDue2026Member 2023-10-24 2023-10-24 0000313616 dhr:A1.2SeniorNotesDue2027Member 2023-10-24 2023-10-24 0000313616 dhr:A0.45SeniorNotesDue2028Member 2023-10-24 2023-10-24 0000313616 dhr:A2.5SeniorNotesDue2030Member 2023-10-24 2023-10-24 0000313616 dhr:A0.75SeniorNotesDue2031Member 2023-10-24 2023-10-24 0000313616 dhr:A1.35SeniorNotesDue2039Member 2023-10-24 2023-10-24 0000313616 dhr:A1.8SeniorNotesDue2049Member 2023-10-24 2023-10-24 UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Washington, D.C. 20549 __________________ FORM 8-K __________________ CURRENT REPORT Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Date of report (Date of earliest event reported): October 24, 2023 __________________ DANAHER CORPORATION (Exact Name of Registrant as Specified in Its Charter) __________________ Delaware 001-08089 59-1995548 (State or Other Jurisdiction of Incorporation) (Commission File Number) (IRS Employer Identification No.) 2200 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., 20037-1701 Suite 800W Washington, DC (Address of Principal Executive Offices) (Zip Code) 202 - 828-0850 (Registrant’s Telephone Number, Including Area Code) Not applicable (Former Name or Former Address, if Changed Since Last Report) __________________ Check the appropriate box below if the Form 8-K filing is intended to simultaneously satisfy the filing obligation of the registrant under any of the following provisions ( see General Instruction A.2. below): ☐ Written communications pursuant to Rule 425 under the Securities Act (17 CFR 230.425) ☐ Soliciting material pursuant to Rule 14a-12 under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.14a-12) ☐ Pre-commencement communications pursuant to Rule 14d-2(b) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.14d-2(b)) ☐ Pre-commencement communications pursuant to Rule 13e-4(c) under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.13e-4(c)) Securities registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Act: Title of each class Trading Symbol(s) Name of each exchange on which registered Common stock, $0.01 par value DHR New York Stock Exchange 1.700% Senior Notes due 2024 DHR 24 New York Stock Exchange 0.200% Senior Notes due 2026 DHR/26 New York Stock Exchange 2.100% Senior Notes due 2026 DHR 26 New York Stock Exchange 1.200% Senior Notes due 2027 DHR/27 New York Stock Exchange 0.450% Senior Notes due 2028 DHR/28 New York Stock Exchange 2.500% Senior Notes due 2030 DHR 30 New York Stock Exchange 0.750% Senior Notes due 2031 DHR/31 New York Stock Exchange 1.350% Senior Notes due 2039 DHR/39 New York Stock Exchange 1.800% Senior Notes due 2049 DHR/49 New York Stock Exchange Indicate by check mark whether the registrant is an emerging growth company as defined in Rule 405 of the Securities Act of 1933 (17 CFR §230.405) or Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (17 CFR §240.12b-2).

DANAHER CORPORATION Date: October 23, 2023 By: /s/ Matthew R. McGrew Matthew R. McGrew Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer ","EX-99:EX-99 2 dhr-20231023xex991.htm EX-99 Document Exhibit 99.1 Danaher Reports Third Quarter 2023 Results WASHINGTON, D.C., October 24, 2023 -- Danaher Corporation (NYSE: DHR) (the “Company”) today announced results for the third quarter ended September 29, 2023. Net earnings refer to net earnings attributable to common shareholders. Results for the third quarter include the operations of Veralto Corporation, which was spun-off to Danaher's shareholders on September 30, 2023. Key Third Quarter 2023 Results • Net earnings were $1.1 billion, or $1.51 per diluted common share and non-GAAP adjusted diluted net earnings per common share were $2.02. • Revenues decreased 10.5% year-over-year to $6.9 billion. • Non-GAAP core revenue decreased 11.5%, including a 3.0% non-GAAP base business core revenue decline. • Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $1.7 billion and non-GAAP free cash flow was $1.3 billion. Rainer M. Blair, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “Revenue in the third quarter came in ahead of our expectations, with Biotechnology performing as anticipated, and higher respiratory testing revenue more than offsetting slightly softer-than-anticipated demand in Life Sciences. DBS-driven execution also enabled us to deliver better-than-expected earnings and cash flow in what remains a challenging operating environment.” Blair continued, “We also successfully completed the spin-off of Veralto. Going forward, Danaher is dedicated to accelerating the power of science and technology to improve human health. With our differentiated portfolio and commitment to continuous improvement, we have a unique opportunity to help solve many of the world's most critical health care challenges while building meaningful long-term shareholder value.” Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Outlook The Company provides forecasted sales only on a non-GAAP basis because of the difficulty in estimating the other components of GAAP revenue, such as currency translation, acquisitions and divested product lines. The Company’s fourth quarter and full year outlook include only Danaher’s continuing operations, excluding the impact of Veralto. For the fourth quarter 2023, the Company anticipates that non-GAAP base business core revenue from continuing operations will be down mid-single digits year-over-year. For full year 2023, the Company anticipates that non-GAAP base business core revenue from continuing operations will be down slightly year-over-year.

Notes to Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures A Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets in the following historical periods (only the pretax amounts set forth below are reflected in the amortization line item above): Three-Month Period Ended Nine-Month Period Ended September 29, 2023 September 30, 2022 September 29, 2023 September 30, 2022 Pretax $ 379 $ 361 $ 1,147 $ 1,120 After-tax 306 293 926 904 B Net (gains) losses on the Company's equity and limited partnership investments recorded in the following historical periods (only the pretax amounts set forth below are reflected in the fair value net (gains) losses on investments line above): Three-Month Period Ended Nine-Month Period Ended September 29, 2023 September 30, 2022 September 29, 2023 September 30, 2022 Pretax $ 48 $ 64 $ 58 $ 186 After-tax 36 48 44 141 C Costs incurred in the three and nine-month periods ended September 29, 2023 related to preparation for the separation of the Company’s Environmental & Applied Solutions business, primarily related to professional fees for legal, tax, finance, banking and information technology services and duplicative general and administrative costs ($36 million and $101 million pretax as reported in this line item, and $31 million and $90 million after-tax, respectively). D Impairment charges related to a trade name in the Environmental & Applied Solutions segment recorded in the three-month period ended September 29, 2023 ($6 million pretax as reported in this line item, $4 million after-tax). Impairment charges related to technology and other assets in the Biotechnology segment and customer relationships and a trade name in the Environmental & Applied Solutions segment recorded in the nine-month period ended September 29, 2023 ($54 million pretax as reported in this line item, $41 million after-tax). Impairment charges related to technology and customer relationships in the Environmental & Applied Solutions segment recorded in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 ($9 million pretax as reported in this line item, $7 million after-tax). Additionally, in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022, charges incurred primarily related to impairments of accounts receivable and inventory as well as accruals for contractual obligations in Russia ($43 million pretax as reported in this line item, $40 million after-tax). 5 DANAHER CORPORATION RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (continued) E Loss on a partial settlement of a defined benefit plan as a result of the transfer of a portion of the Company’s non-U.S. pension liabilities related to one defined benefit plan to a third-party in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 ($10 million pretax as reported in this line item, $9 million after-tax). F This line item reflects the aggregate tax effect of all nontax adjustments reflected in the preceding line items of the table. In addition, the footnotes above indicate the after-tax amount of each individual adjustment item. Danaher estimates the tax effect of each adjustment item by applying Danaher’s overall estimated effective tax rate to the pretax amount, unless the nature of the item and/or the tax jurisdiction in which the item has been recorded requires application of a specific tax rate or tax treatment, in which case the tax effect of such item is estimated by applying such specific tax rate or tax treatment. The MCPS dividends are not tax deductible and therefore the tax effect of the adjustments does not include any tax impact of the MCPS dividends. G There were no net discrete tax adjustments and other tax-related adjustments for the three-month period ended September 29, 2023, as discrete tax benefits from excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation were offset by charges related to tax costs related to the separation of the Environmental & Applied Solutions business and changes in estimates associated with prior period uncertain tax positions. Discrete tax adjustments and other tax-related adjustments for the nine-month period ended September 29, 2023, include the impact of a net discrete tax loss of $13 million related primarily to tax costs related to the separation of the Environmental & Applied Solutions business and tax costs related to legal and operational actions taken to realign certain businesses and changes in estimates associated with prior period uncertain tax positions, partially offset by excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and interest on prior year tax refunds. Discrete tax adjustments and other tax-related adjustments for the three-month period ended September 30, 2022, include the impact of net discrete tax benefits of $3 million related primarily to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation partially offset by changes in estimates associated with prior period uncertain tax positions. Discrete tax adjustments and other tax-related adjustments for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022, include the impact of net discrete tax benefits of $52 million related primarily to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and changes in estimates associated with prior period uncertain tax positions. Average and Adjusted Average Common Stock and Common Equivalent Diluted Shares Outstanding (shares in millions) Three-Month Period Ended Nine-Month Period Ended September 29, 2023 September 30, 2022 September 29, 2023 September 30, 2022 Average common stock and common equivalent shares outstanding - diluted (GAAP) 2 745.9 737.4 742.1 737.0 Converted shares 3 — 8.6 3.4 8.6 Adjusted average common stock and common equivalent shares outstanding - diluted (non-GAAP) 745.9 746.0 745.5 745.6 2 The impact of the MCPS Series B calculated under the if-converted method was anti-dilutive for the nine-month period ended September 29, 2023 and the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2022, and as such 3.4 million shares for the nine-month period ended September 29, 2023 and 8.6 million for both the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2022 underlying the MCPS Series B were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS and the related MCPS Series B dividends of $21 million for the nine-month period ended September 29, 2023 and $21 million and $64 million for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2022, respectively, were included in the calculation of net earnings for diluted EPS. As of April 17, 2023, all outstanding shares of the MCPS Series B converted into 8.6 million shares of the Company’s common stock. The impact of the MCPS Series A calculated under the if-converted method was dilutive for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022, and as such 4.0 million shares underlying the MCPS Series A were included in the calculation of diluted EPS. The related MCPS Series A dividends of $20 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022 were excluded from the calculation of net earnings for diluted EPS. On April 15, 2022, all outstanding shares of the MCPS Series A converted into 11.0 million shares of the Company’s common stock. 3 The number of converted shares assumes the conversion of all MCPS and issuance of the underlying shares applying the “if-converted” method of accounting and using the actual conversion rates for the nine-month period ended September 29, 2023 and an average 20 trading-day trailing Volume Weighted Average Price of $274.64 as of September 30, 2022. 6 DANAHER CORPORATION RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (continued) Sales (Decline) Growth by Segment, Core Sales (Decline) Growth by Segment and Base Business Core Sales (Decline) Growth by Segment % Change Three-Month Period Ended September 29, 2023 vs. Comparable 2022 Period Segments Total Company Biotechnology Life Sciences Diagnostics Environmental & Applied Solutions Total sales (decline) growth (GAAP) (10.5) % (19.0) % (1.0) % (16.0) % 3.5 % Impact of: Acquisitions/divestitures (0.5) % (0.5) % (1.0) % — % (0.5) % Currency exchange rates (0.5) % (1.5) % (0.5) % 0.5 % (2.0) % Core sales (decline) growth (non-GAAP) (11.5) % (21.0) % (2.5) % (15.5) % 1.0 % Impact of COVID-19 related testing, vaccines and therapeutics 8.5 % +Mid-single digit +Up slightly +Low-twenties — % Base business core sales (decline) growth (non-GAAP) (3.0) % -Mid-teens -Low-single digit +Mid-single digit 1.0 % % Change Nine-Month Period Ended September 29, 2023 vs. Comparable 2022 Period Segments Total Company Biotechnology Life Sciences Diagnostics Environmental & Applied Solutions Total sales (decline) growth (GAAP) (8.0) % (17.0) % 2.5 % (13.0) % 3.5 % Impact of: Acquisitions/divestitures (0.5) % — % (1.0) % — % (0.5) % Currency exchange rates 1.0 % 0.5 % 1.0 % 1.5 % — % Core sales (decline) growth (non-GAAP) (7.5) % (16.5) % 2.5 % (11.5) % 3.0 % Impact of COVID-19 related testing, vaccines and therapeutics 9.0 % +High-single digit +Low-single digit +Low-twenties — % Base business core sales growth (decline) (non-GAAP) 1.5 % -High-single digit +Mid-single digit +High-single digit 3.0 % Note: We expect overall demand for the Company’s COVID-19 related products to continue moderating as the pandemic has evolved toward endemic status. We believe certain demand for the Company’s products that support COVID-19 related vaccines and therapeutics (including initiatives that seek to prevent or mitigate similar, future pandemics) and COVID-19 testing will continue, though that demand will likely be uncertain and will vary from period to period. At the beginning of 2022, the Company believed that on a relative basis, the level of ongoing demand for products supporting COVID-19 testing would be subject to more fluctuations in demand than the level of demand for products supporting COVID-19 related vaccines and therapeutics, due in part to expected COVID-19 case levels, vaccination rates and use of therapies. However, as a result of lower vaccination rates and the spread of less severe variants of the virus, 2022 demand for the Company’s products supporting COVID-19 related vaccines and therapeutics fluctuated and declined more than anticipated at the beginning of the year. Therefore, beginning with the first quarter of 2023, we have revised the definition of “base business core sales growth” on a basis that not only excludes revenues related to COVID-19 testing but also excludes revenues from products that support COVID-19 related vaccines and therapeutics. We believe this adjusted definition of “base business core sales growth” provides more useful information to investors by facilitating period-to-period comparisons of our financial performance and identifying underlying growth trends in the Company’s business that otherwise may be obscured by fluctuations in demand for COVID-19 related products.

The reporting of Veralto as a discontinued operation will be reflected in the Company’s future filings, but in no way revises or restates any Consolidated Statements of Earnings for any period previously filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 7 DANAHER CORPORATION RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (continued) Operating Profit Margins and Year-Over-Year Core Operating Profit Margin Changes Segments Total Company Biotechnology Life Sciences Diagnostics Environmental & Applied Solutions Three-Month Period Ended September 30, 2022 Operating Profit Margins (GAAP) 26.30 % 33.70 % 20.50 % 28.40 % 23.70 % Third quarter 2023 impact from operating profit margins of businesses that have been owned for less than one year (0.05) 0.05 (0.25) (0.05) 0.10 Third quarter 2023 impairment charges related to a trade name in the Environmental & Applied Solutions segment (0.10) — — — (0.50) Third quarter 2023 costs incurred related to preparation for the separation of the Company's Environmental & Applied Solutions business (0.55) — — — — Year-over-year core operating profit margin changes for the third quarter 2023 (defined as all year-over-year operating profit margin changes other than the changes identified in the line items above) (non-GAAP) (4.70) (8.65) (1.95) (4.45) (0.40) Three-Month Period Ended September 29, 2023 Operating Profit Margins (GAAP) 20.90 % 25.10 % 18.30 % 23.90 % 22.90 % Segments Total Company Biotechnology Life Sciences Diagnostics Environmental & Applied Solutions Nine-Month Period Ended September 30, 2022 Operating Profit Margins (GAAP) 27.70 % 35.40 % 20.10 % 31.00 % 23.10 % First nine months of 2023 impact from operating profit margins of businesses that have been owned for less than one year or were disposed of during such period and did not qualify as discontinued operations (0.10) (0.10) (0.35) (0.05) 0.10 Second quarter 2023 impairment charges related to technology and other assets in the Biotechnology segment and customer relationships in the Environmental & Applied Solutions segment and third quarter 2023 impairment charge related to a trade name in the Environmental & Applied Solutions segment, net of a second quarter 2022 impairment charge related to technology and customer relationships in the Environmental & Applied Solutions segment (0.20) (0.80) — — (0.05) First nine months of 2023 costs incurred related to preparation for the separation of the Company's Environmental & Applied Solutions business (0.45) — — — — First nine months of 2022 impairments of accounts receivable and inventory as well as accruals for contractual obligations in Russia 0.15 0.20 0.50 0.05 — Year-over-year core operating profit margin changes for first nine months of 2023 (defined as all year-over-year operating profit margin changes other than the changes identified in the line items above) (non-GAAP) (5.10) (7.10) (1.55) (7.10) 0.75 Nine-Month Period Ended September 29, 2023 Operating Profit Margins (GAAP) 22.00 % 27.60 % 18.70 % 23.90 % 23.90 % 8 DANAHER CORPORATION RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (continued) Cash Flow and Free Cash Flow ($ in millions) Three-Month Period Ended Year-over-Year Change September 29, 2023 September 30, 2022 Total Cash Flow: Net cash provided by operating activities (GAAP) $ 1,672 $ 2,010 Total cash used in investing activities (GAAP) $ (329) $ (515) Total cash provided by (used in) financing activities (GAAP) $ 2,443 $ (230) Free Cash Flow: Net cash provided by operating activities (GAAP) $ 1,672 $ 2,010 ~ (17.0) % Less: payments for additions to property, plant & equipment (capital expenditures) (GAAP) (365) (277) Plus: proceeds from sales of property, plant & equipment (capital disposals) (GAAP) 4 — Free cash flow (non-GAAP) $ 1,311 $ 1,733 ~ (24.5) % We define free cash flow as operating cash flows, less payments for additions to property, plant and equipment (“capital expenditures”) plus the proceeds from sales of plant, property and equipment (“capital disposals”). 9 Statement Regarding Non-GAAP Measures Each of the non-GAAP measures set forth above should be considered in addition to, and not as a replacement for or superior to, the comparable GAAP measure, and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes that these measures provide useful information to investors by offering additional ways of viewing Danaher Corporation’s (“Danaher” or the “Company”) results that, when reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measure, help our investors: • with respect to Adjusted Diluted Net Earnings Per Common Share, understand the long-term profitability trends of our business and compare our profitability to prior and future periods and to our peers; • with respect to core sales and related non-GAAP sales measures, identify underlying growth trends in our business and compare our sales performance with prior and future periods and to our peers; and • with respect to free cash flow and related non-GAAP cash flow measures (the “FCF Measure”), understand Danaher’s ability to generate cash without external financings, strengthen its balance sheet, invest in its business and grow its business through acquisitions and other strategic opportunities (although a limitation of free cash flow is that it does not take into account the Company’s debt service requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures, and as a result the entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures). We expect overall demand for the Company’s COVID-19 related products to continue moderating as the pandemic has evolved toward endemic status. We believe certain demand for the Company’s products that support COVID-19 related vaccines and therapeutics (including initiatives that seek to prevent or mitigate similar, future pandemics) and COVID-19 testing will continue, though that demand will likely be uncertain and will vary from period to period. At the beginning of 2022, the Company believed that on a relative basis, the level of ongoing demand for products supporting COVID-19 testing would be subject to more fluctuations in demand than the level of demand for products supporting COVID-19 related vaccines and therapeutics, due in part to expected COVID-19 case levels, vaccination rates and use of therapies. However, as a result of lower vaccination rates and the spread of less severe variants of the virus, 2022 demand for the Company’s products supporting COVID-19 related vaccines and therapeutics fluctuated and declined more than anticipated at the beginning of the year. Therefore, beginning with the first quarter of 2023, we have revised the definition of “base business core sales growth” on a basis that not only excludes revenues related to COVID-19 testing but also excludes revenues from products that support COVID-19 related vaccines and therapeutics. We believe this adjusted definition of “base business core sales growth” provides more useful information to investors by facilitating period-to-period comparisons of our financial performance and identifying underlying growth trends in the Company’s business that otherwise may be obscured by fluctuations in demand for COVID-19 related products. Management uses the non-GAAP measures referenced above to measure the Company’s operating and financial performance, and uses core sales and non-GAAP measures similar to Adjusted Diluted Net Earnings Per Common Share and the FCF Measure in the Company’s executive compensation program. The items excluded from the non-GAAP measures set forth above have been excluded for the following reasons: • With respect to Adjusted Diluted Net Earnings Per Common Share: ◦ Amortization of Intangible Assets: We exclude the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because the amount and timing of such charges are significantly impacted by the timing, size, number and nature of the acquisitions we consummate. While we have a history of significant acquisition activity we do not acquire businesses on a predictable cycle, and the amount of an acquisition’s purchase price allocated to intangible assets and related amortization term are unique to each acquisition and can vary significantly from acquisition to acquisition. Exclusion of this amortization expense facilitates more consistent comparisons of operating results over time between our newly acquired and long-held businesses, and with both acquisitive and non-acquisitive peer companies. We believe however that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to sales generation and that intangible asset amortization related to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. ◦ Restructuring Charges: We exclude costs incurred pursuant to discrete restructuring plans that are fundamentally different (in terms of the size, strategic nature and planning requirements, as well as the inconsistent frequency, of such plans) from the ongoing productivity improvements that result from application of the Danaher Business System. Because these restructuring plans are incremental to the core activities that arise in the ordinary course of our business and we believe are not indicative of Danaher’s ongoing operating costs in a given period, we exclude these costs to facilitate a more consistent comparison of operating results over time. 10 ◦ Other Adjustments: With respect to the other items excluded from Adjusted Diluted Net Earnings Per Common Share, we exclude these items because they are of a nature and/or size that occur with inconsistent frequency, occur for reasons that may be unrelated to Danaher's commercial performance during the period and/or we believe that such items may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult. For example, we excluded the first quarter 2022 charge for asset impairments, accruals for contractual obligations and similar items related to our Russia operations because, even though it is possible we could incur additional charges in the future, we do not believe these charges are indicative of Danaher’s ongoing operating costs. • With respect to adjusted average common stock and common equivalent shares outstanding, Danaher’s Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (“MCPS”) Series A converted into Danaher common stock on April 15, 2022 and the MCPS Series B mandatorily converted into Danaher common stock on the mandatory conversion date of April 17, 2023 (unless converted or redeemed earlier in accordance with the terms of the applicable certificate of designations). With respect to the calculation of Adjusted Diluted Net Earnings Per Common Share, we apply the “if converted” method of share dilution to the MCPS Series A and B in all applicable periods irrespective of whether such preferred shares would be dilutive or anti-dilutive in the period. We believe this presentation provides useful information to investors by helping them understand the net impact on Danaher’s earnings per share-related measures irrespective of the period. • With respect to core sales related measures, (1) we exclude the impact of currency translation because it is not under management’s control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends, and (2) we exclude the effect of acquisitions and divested product lines because the timing, size, number and nature of such transactions can vary significantly from period-to-period and between us and our peers, which we believe may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult. • With respect to the FCF Measure, we exclude payments for additions to property, plant and equipment (net of the proceeds from capital disposals) to demonstrate the amount of operating cash flow for the period that remains after accounting for the Company’s capital expenditure requirements. The Company provides forecasted sales only on a non-GAAP basis because of the difficulty in estimating the other components of GAAP revenue, such as currency translation, acquisitions and divested product lines. 11 "

Results of Operations and Financial Condition. On September 17, 2019 , Adobe Inc. (“Adobe”) issued a press release announcing financial results for its third fiscal quarter ended August 30, 2019 . A copy of this press release is furnished and attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. The information in this report and the exhibit attached hereto are being furnished and shall not be deemed filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly stated by specific reference in such filing. The attached press release includes non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP tax rate, non-GAAP diluted net income per share. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. We believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. For our internal budgeting and resource allocation process, we use non-GAAP financial measures, net of the related tax impacts, which exclude: (A) stock-based and deferred compensation expense; (B) amortization of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements; (C) investment gains and losses; (D) income tax adjustments; and (E) the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes. We use these non-GAAP financial measures in making operating decisions because we believe the measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and give us a better understanding of how we should invest in research and development and fund infrastructure and go-to-market strategies. We use these measures to help us make budgeting decisions, for example, as between product development expenses and research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses and to facilitate our internal comparisons to our historical operating results. In addition, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. This allows institutional investors, the analyst community and others to better understand and evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management and to compare operating results across accounting periods and to those of our peer companies. As described above, we exclude the following items from one or more of our non-GAAP measures: A. Stock-based and deferred compensation expenses and related tax impact. Stock-based compensation expense consists of charges for employee restricted stock units, performance shares and employee stock purchases in accordance with current GAAP including stock-based compensation expense associated with any unvested options and restricted stock units assumed in connection with our acquisitions. As we apply current stock-based compensation standards, we believe that it is useful to investors to understand the impact of the application of these standards to our operational performance, liquidity and our ability to invest in research and development and fund acquisitions and capital expenditures. Deferred compensation expense consists of charges associated with movements in our deferred compensation plan liability. Although stock-based compensation and deferred compensation expenses constitute ongoing and recurring expenses, such expenses are excluded from non-GAAP results because they are not expenses that typically require current cash settlement by us and because such expenses are not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations. We further believe these measures are useful to investors in that they allow for greater transparency to certain line items in our financial statements. In addition, excluding these items from various non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to our competitors’ operating results. B. Amortization of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements and related tax impact. We recognize amortization expense of purchased intangibles in connection with our acquisitions. Purchased intangibles include (i) purchased technology, (ii) trademarks, (iii) customer contracts and relationships, and (iv) other intangibles. In accordance with GAAP, we amortize the fair value of the purchased intangibles based on the pattern in which we expect the economic benefits of the intangible assets will be consumed as revenue is generated. Although the intangible assets generate revenue for us, we exclude this item because the expense is non-cash in nature and because we believe the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance, liquidity and our ability to invest in research and development, and fund acquisitions and capital expenditures. In addition, excluding this item from various non-GAAP measures facilitates our internal comparisons to our historical operating results and comparisons to our competitors’ 2 operating results. Periodically, we also incur charges related to prior activity in connection with technology license arrangements. We exclude these items because the expense is not reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. C. Investment gains and losses and related tax impact. We incur investment gains and losses principally from realized gains or losses from the sale and exchange of marketable equity investments, other-than-temporary declines in the value of marketable and non-marketable equity securities, unrealized holding gains and losses associated with our deferred compensation plan assets (classified as trading securities), gains and losses on the sale of equity securities held indirectly through investment partnerships, and gains and losses associated with the recording of equity or cost method investments to fair value upon obtaining control through a business combination, as required by GAAP. We do not actively trade publicly held securities nor do we rely on these securities positions for funding our ongoing operations. We exclude gains and losses and the related tax impact on these equity securities because these items are unrelated to our ongoing business and operating results. D. Income tax adjustments. Our income tax expense is based on our GAAP taxable income and actual tax rates in effect, which can differ significantly from the non-GAAP tax rate applied to our non-GAAP financial results. In arriving at our non-GAAP tax rate, certain non-recurring and period specific income tax adjustments, such as a one-time tax charge in connection with an acquisition, resolution of certain income tax audits and any significant financial impacts resulting from tax legislation (including the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) are made to help us assess the core profitability of our business operations. This non-GAAP tax rate could be subject to change for several reasons, including significant changes in our geographic earnings mix or fundamental tax law changes in major jurisdictions in which we operate. E. Income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes. Excluding the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes assists investors in understanding the tax provision associated with those adjustments and the effective tax rate related to our ongoing operations. We believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our financial results in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures and that is why we qualify the use of non-GAAP financial information in a statement when non-GAAP information is presented. 3 Item 9.01.

Adobe uses non-GAAP financial information to evaluate its ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. Adobe's management does not itself, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adobe presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate Adobe's operating results. Adobe believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. This allows institutional investors, the analyst community and others to better understand and evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management. Adobe's management believes it is useful for itself and investors to review, as applicable, both GAAP information as well as non-GAAP measures, which may exclude items such as stock-based and deferred compensation expenses, restructuring and other charges, amortization of purchased intangibles and certain activity in connection with technology license arrangements, investment gains and losses, the related tax impact of all of these items, income tax adjustments, and the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes. Adobe uses these non-GAAP measures in order to assess the performance of Adobe's business and for planning and forecasting in subsequent periods. Whenever such a non-GAAP measure is used, Adobe provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most closely applicable GAAP financial measure.

Results of Operations and Financial Condition. On September 17, 2019 , Adobe Inc. (“Adobe”) issued a press release announcing financial results for its third fiscal quarter ended August 30, 2019 . A copy of this press release is furnished and attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. The information in this report and the exhibit attached hereto are being furnished and shall not be deemed filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly stated by specific reference in such filing. The attached press release includes non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP tax rate, non-GAAP diluted net income per share. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. We believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. For our internal budgeting and resource allocation process, we use non-GAAP financial measures, net of the related tax impacts, which exclude: (A) stock-based and deferred compensation expense; (B) amortization of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements; (C) investment gains and losses; (D) income tax adjustments; and (E) the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes. We use these non-GAAP financial measures in making operating decisions because we believe the measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and give us a better understanding of how we should invest in research and development and fund infrastructure and go-to-market strategies. We use these measures to help us make budgeting decisions, for example, as between product development expenses and research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses and to facilitate our internal comparisons to our historical operating results. In addition, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. This allows institutional investors, the analyst community and others to better understand and evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management and to compare operating results across accounting periods and to those of our peer companies. As described above, we exclude the following items from one or more of our non-GAAP measures: A. Stock-based and deferred compensation expenses and related tax impact. Stock-based compensation expense consists of charges for employee restricted stock units, performance shares and employee stock purchases in accordance with current GAAP including stock-based compensation expense associated with any unvested options and restricted stock units assumed in connection with our acquisitions. As we apply current stock-based compensation standards, we believe that it is useful to investors to understand the impact of the application of these standards to our operational performance, liquidity and our ability to invest in research and development and fund acquisitions and capital expenditures. Deferred compensation expense consists of charges associated with movements in our deferred compensation plan liability. Although stock-based compensation and deferred compensation expenses constitute ongoing and recurring expenses, such expenses are excluded from non-GAAP results because they are not expenses that typically require current cash settlement by us and because such expenses are not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations. We further believe these measures are useful to investors in that they allow for greater transparency to certain line items in our financial statements. In addition, excluding these items from various non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to our competitors’ operating results. B. Amortization of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements and related tax impact. We recognize amortization expense of purchased intangibles in connection with our acquisitions. Purchased intangibles include (i) purchased technology, (ii) trademarks, (iii) customer contracts and relationships, and (iv) other intangibles. In accordance with GAAP, we amortize the fair value of the purchased intangibles based on the pattern in which we expect the economic benefits of the intangible assets will be consumed as revenue is generated. Although the intangible assets generate revenue for us, we exclude this item because the expense is non-cash in nature and because we believe the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance, liquidity and our ability to invest in research and development, and fund acquisitions and capital expenditures. In addition, excluding this item from various non-GAAP measures facilitates our internal comparisons to our historical operating results and comparisons to our competitors’ 2 operating results. Periodically, we also incur charges related to prior activity in connection with technology license arrangements. We exclude these items because the expense is not reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. C. Investment gains and losses and related tax impact. We incur investment gains and losses principally from realized gains or losses from the sale and exchange of marketable equity investments, other-than-temporary declines in the value of marketable and non-marketable equity securities, unrealized holding gains and losses associated with our deferred compensation plan assets (classified as trading securities), gains and losses on the sale of equity securities held indirectly through investment partnerships, and gains and losses associated with the recording of equity or cost method investments to fair value upon obtaining control through a business combination, as required by GAAP. We do not actively trade publicly held securities nor do we rely on these securities positions for funding our ongoing operations. We exclude gains and losses and the related tax impact on these equity securities because these items are unrelated to our ongoing business and operating results. D. Income tax adjustments. Our income tax expense is based on our GAAP taxable income and actual tax rates in effect, which can differ significantly from the non-GAAP tax rate applied to our non-GAAP financial results. In arriving at our non-GAAP tax rate, certain non-recurring and period specific income tax adjustments, such as a one-time tax charge in connection with an acquisition, resolution of certain income tax audits and any significant financial impacts resulting from tax legislation (including the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) are made to help us assess the core profitability of our business operations. This non-GAAP tax rate could be subject to change for several reasons, including significant changes in our geographic earnings mix or fundamental tax law changes in major jurisdictions in which we operate. E. Income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes. Excluding the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes assists investors in understanding the tax provision associated with those adjustments and the effective tax rate related to our ongoing operations. We believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our financial results in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures and that is why we qualify the use of non-GAAP financial information in a statement when non-GAAP information is presented. 3 Item 9.01.

Adobe uses non-GAAP financial information to evaluate its ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. Adobe's management does not itself, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adobe presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate Adobe's operating results. Adobe believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. This allows institutional investors, the analyst community and others to better understand and evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management. Adobe's management believes it is useful for itself and investors to review, as applicable, both GAAP information as well as non-GAAP measures, which may exclude items such as stock-based and deferred compensation expenses, restructuring and other charges, amortization of purchased intangibles and certain activity in connection with technology license arrangements, investment gains and losses, the related tax impact of all of these items, income tax adjustments, and the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes. Adobe uses these non-GAAP measures in order to assess the performance of Adobe's business and for planning and forecasting in subsequent periods. Whenever such a non-GAAP measure is used, Adobe provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most closely applicable GAAP financial measure. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure as detailed above. 7 "

Results of Operations and Financial Condition. On June 18, 2019 , Adobe Inc. (“Adobe”) issued a press release announcing financial results for its second fiscal quarter ended May 31, 2019 . A copy of this press release is furnished and attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. The information in this report and the exhibit attached hereto are being furnished and shall not be deemed filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly stated by specific reference in such filing. The attached press release includes non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP tax rate, non-GAAP diluted net income per share. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. We believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. For our internal budgeting and resource allocation process, we use non-GAAP financial measures, net of the related tax impacts, which exclude: (A) stock-based and deferred compensation expense; (B) amortization of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements; (C) investment gains and losses; (D) income tax adjustments; and (E) the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes. We use these non-GAAP financial measures in making operating decisions because we believe the measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and give us a better understanding of how we should invest in research and development and fund infrastructure and go-to-market strategies. We use these measures to help us make budgeting decisions, for example, as between product development expenses and research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses and to facilitate our internal comparisons to our historical operating results. In addition, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. This allows institutional investors, the analyst community and others to better understand and evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management and to compare operating results across accounting periods and to those of our peer companies. As described above, we exclude the following items from one or more of our non-GAAP measures: A. Stock-based and deferred compensation expenses and related tax impact. Stock-based compensation expense consists of charges for employee restricted stock units, performance shares and employee stock purchases in accordance with current GAAP including stock-based compensation expense associated with any unvested options and restricted stock units assumed in connection with our acquisitions. As we apply current stock-based compensation standards, we believe that it is useful to investors to understand the impact of the application of these standards to our operational performance, liquidity and our ability to invest in research and development and fund acquisitions and capital expenditures. Deferred compensation expense consists of charges associated with movements in our deferred compensation plan liability. Although stock-based compensation and deferred compensation expenses constitute ongoing and recurring expenses, such expenses are excluded from non-GAAP results because they are not expenses that typically require current cash settlement by us and because such expenses are not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations. We further believe these measures are useful to investors in that they allow for greater transparency to certain line items in our financial statements. In addition, excluding these items from various non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to our competitors’ operating results. B. Amortization of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements and related tax impact. We recognize amortization expense of purchased intangibles in connection with our acquisitions. Purchased intangibles include (i) purchased technology, (ii) trademarks, (iii) customer contracts and relationships, and (iv) other intangibles. In accordance with GAAP, we amortize the fair value of the purchased intangibles based on the pattern in which we expect the economic benefits of the intangible assets will be consumed as revenue is generated. Although the intangible assets generate revenue for us, we exclude this item because the expense is non-cash in nature and because we believe the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance, liquidity and our ability to invest in research and development, and fund acquisitions and capital expenditures. In addition, excluding this item from various non-GAAP measures facilitates our internal comparisons to our historical operating results and comparisons to our competitors’ 2 operating results. Periodically, we also incur charges related to prior activity in connection with technology license arrangements. We exclude these items because the expense is not reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. C. Investment gains and losses and related tax impact. We incur investment gains and losses principally from realized gains or losses from the sale and exchange of marketable equity investments, other-than-temporary declines in the value of marketable and non-marketable equity securities, unrealized holding gains and losses associated with our deferred compensation plan assets (classified as trading securities), gains and losses on the sale of equity securities held indirectly through investment partnerships, and gains and losses associated with the recording of equity or cost method investments to fair value upon obtaining control through a business combination, as required by GAAP. We do not actively trade publicly held securities nor do we rely on these securities positions for funding our ongoing operations. We exclude gains and losses and the related tax impact on these equity securities because these items are unrelated to our ongoing business and operating results. D. Income tax adjustments. Our income tax expense is based on our GAAP taxable income and actual tax rates in effect, which can differ significantly from the non-GAAP tax rate applied to our non-GAAP financial results. In arriving at our non-GAAP tax rate, certain non-recurring and period specific income tax adjustments, such as a one-time tax charge in connection with an acquisition, resolution of certain income tax audits and any significant financial impacts resulting from tax legislation (including the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) are made to help us assess the core profitability of our business operations. This non-GAAP tax rate could be subject to change for several reasons, including significant changes in our geographic earnings mix or fundamental tax law changes in major jurisdictions in which we operate. E. Income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes. Excluding the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes assists investors in understanding the tax provision associated with those adjustments and the effective tax rate related to our ongoing operations. We believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our financial results in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures and that is why we qualify the use of non-GAAP financial information in a statement when non-GAAP information is presented. 3 Item 9.01.

Adobe uses non-GAAP financial information to evaluate its ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. Adobe's management does not itself, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adobe presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate Adobe's operating results. Adobe believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. This allows institutional investors, the analyst community and others to better understand and evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management. Adobe's management believes it is useful for itself and investors to review, as applicable, both GAAP information as well as non-GAAP measures, which may exclude items such as stock-based and deferred compensation expenses, restructuring and other charges, amortization of purchased intangibles and certain activity in connection with technology license arrangements, investment gains and losses, the related tax impact of all of these items, income tax adjustments, and the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes. Adobe uses these non-GAAP measures in order to assess the performance of Adobe's business and for planning and forecasting in subsequent periods. Whenever such a non-GAAP measure is used, Adobe provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most closely applicable GAAP financial measure.

Results of Operations and Financial Condition. On June 18, 2019 , Adobe Inc. (“Adobe”) issued a press release announcing financial results for its second fiscal quarter ended May 31, 2019 . A copy of this press release is furnished and attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference. The information in this report and the exhibit attached hereto are being furnished and shall not be deemed filed for purposes of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly stated by specific reference in such filing. The attached press release includes non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP tax rate, non-GAAP diluted net income per share. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. We believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. For our internal budgeting and resource allocation process, we use non-GAAP financial measures, net of the related tax impacts, which exclude: (A) stock-based and deferred compensation expense; (B) amortization of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements; (C) investment gains and losses; (D) income tax adjustments; and (E) the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes. We use these non-GAAP financial measures in making operating decisions because we believe the measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and give us a better understanding of how we should invest in research and development and fund infrastructure and go-to-market strategies. We use these measures to help us make budgeting decisions, for example, as between product development expenses and research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses and to facilitate our internal comparisons to our historical operating results. In addition, we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. This allows institutional investors, the analyst community and others to better understand and evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management and to compare operating results across accounting periods and to those of our peer companies. As described above, we exclude the following items from one or more of our non-GAAP measures: A. Stock-based and deferred compensation expenses and related tax impact. Stock-based compensation expense consists of charges for employee restricted stock units, performance shares and employee stock purchases in accordance with current GAAP including stock-based compensation expense associated with any unvested options and restricted stock units assumed in connection with our acquisitions. As we apply current stock-based compensation standards, we believe that it is useful to investors to understand the impact of the application of these standards to our operational performance, liquidity and our ability to invest in research and development and fund acquisitions and capital expenditures. Deferred compensation expense consists of charges associated with movements in our deferred compensation plan liability. Although stock-based compensation and deferred compensation expenses constitute ongoing and recurring expenses, such expenses are excluded from non-GAAP results because they are not expenses that typically require current cash settlement by us and because such expenses are not used by us to assess the core profitability of our business operations. We further believe these measures are useful to investors in that they allow for greater transparency to certain line items in our financial statements. In addition, excluding these items from various non-GAAP measures facilitates comparisons to our competitors’ operating results. B. Amortization of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements and related tax impact. We recognize amortization expense of purchased intangibles in connection with our acquisitions. Purchased intangibles include (i) purchased technology, (ii) trademarks, (iii) customer contracts and relationships, and (iv) other intangibles. In accordance with GAAP, we amortize the fair value of the purchased intangibles based on the pattern in which we expect the economic benefits of the intangible assets will be consumed as revenue is generated. Although the intangible assets generate revenue for us, we exclude this item because the expense is non-cash in nature and because we believe the non-GAAP financial measures excluding this item provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance, liquidity and our ability to invest in research and development, and fund acquisitions and capital expenditures. In addition, excluding this item from various non-GAAP measures facilitates our internal comparisons to our historical operating results and comparisons to our competitors’ 2 operating results. Periodically, we also incur charges related to prior activity in connection with technology license arrangements. We exclude these items because the expense is not reflective of ongoing operating results in the period incurred. C. Investment gains and losses and related tax impact. We incur investment gains and losses principally from realized gains or losses from the sale and exchange of marketable equity investments, other-than-temporary declines in the value of marketable and non-marketable equity securities, unrealized holding gains and losses associated with our deferred compensation plan assets (classified as trading securities), gains and losses on the sale of equity securities held indirectly through investment partnerships, and gains and losses associated with the recording of equity or cost method investments to fair value upon obtaining control through a business combination, as required by GAAP. We do not actively trade publicly held securities nor do we rely on these securities positions for funding our ongoing operations. We exclude gains and losses and the related tax impact on these equity securities because these items are unrelated to our ongoing business and operating results. D. Income tax adjustments. Our income tax expense is based on our GAAP taxable income and actual tax rates in effect, which can differ significantly from the non-GAAP tax rate applied to our non-GAAP financial results. In arriving at our non-GAAP tax rate, certain non-recurring and period specific income tax adjustments, such as a one-time tax charge in connection with an acquisition, resolution of certain income tax audits and any significant financial impacts resulting from tax legislation (including the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) are made to help us assess the core profitability of our business operations. This non-GAAP tax rate could be subject to change for several reasons, including significant changes in our geographic earnings mix or fundamental tax law changes in major jurisdictions in which we operate. E. Income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes. Excluding the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes assists investors in understanding the tax provision associated with those adjustments and the effective tax rate related to our ongoing operations. We believe that non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate our financial results in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures and that is why we qualify the use of non-GAAP financial information in a statement when non-GAAP information is presented. 3 Item 9.01.

Adobe uses non-GAAP financial information to evaluate its ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. Adobe's management does not itself, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adobe presents such non-GAAP financial measures in reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate Adobe's operating results. Adobe believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. This allows institutional investors, the analyst community and others to better understand and evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management. Adobe's management believes it is useful for itself and investors to review, as applicable, both GAAP information as well as non-GAAP measures, which may exclude items such as stock-based and deferred compensation expenses, restructuring and other charges, amortization of purchased intangibles and certain activity in connection with technology license arrangements, investment gains and losses, the related tax impact of all of these items, income tax adjustments, and the income tax effect of the non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments from the provision for income taxes. Adobe uses these non-GAAP measures in order to assess the performance of Adobe's business and for planning and forecasting in subsequent periods. Whenever such a non-GAAP measure is used, Adobe provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the most closely applicable GAAP financial measure. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure as detailed above. 8 "
